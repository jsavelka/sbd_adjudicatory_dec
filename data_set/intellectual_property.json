Franklin Computer Corporation\nU.S. Court of Appeals Third Circuit\nAugust 30, 1983\n714 F.2d 1240, 219 USPQ 113\n[Editor's note: This case is discussed in Legal Protection of Digital Information in:\nChapter 2, Section II.B.2. (Apple v. Franklin).]\n\nSloviter, Circuit Judge.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nApple Computer, Inc. appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to preliminarily enjoin Franklin Computer Corp. from infringing the copyrights Apple holds on fourteen computer programs.\nThe decision to grant or refuse to grant a preliminary injunction is within the discretion of the district court. See A.O. Smith Corp. v. FTC, 530 F.2d 515, 525 (3d Cir. 1976). Although the scope of our review of the action of the district court in ruling on a motion for preliminary injunction is narrow, reversal is warranted if the trial court has abused its discretion or committed error in applying the law. Kennecott Corp. v. Smith, 637 F.2d 181, 187 (3d Cir. 1980). As the Second Circuit has stated recently, \u201cDespite oft repeated statements that the issuance of a preliminary injunction rests in the discretion of the trial judge whose decisions will be reversed only for \u2018abuse\u2019, a court of appeals must reverse if the district court has proceeded on the basis of an erroneous view of the applicable law.\u201d Donovan v. Bierwirth, 680 F.2d 263, 269 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 103 S.Ct. 488 (1982).\nIn this case the district court denied the preliminary injunction, inter alia, because it had \u201csome doubt as to the copyrightability of the programs.\u201d Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., 545 F. Supp. 812, 215 USPQ 935 (E.D. Pa. 1982). This legal ruling is fundamental to all future proceedings in this action and, as the parties and amici curiae seem to agree, has considerable significance to the computer services industry.1 Because we conclude that the district court proceeded under an erroneous view of the applicable law, we reverse the denial of the preliminary injunction and remand.\nII. Facts and Procedural History\n\nApple, one of the computer industry leaders, manufactures and markets personal computers (micro-computers), related peripheral equipment such as disk drives (peripherals), and computer programs (software). It presently manufactures Apple II computers and distributes over 150 programs. Apple has sold over 400,000 Apple II computers, employs approximately 3,000 people, and had annual sales of $335,000,000 for fiscal year 1981. One of the byproducts of Apple\u2019s success is the independent development by third parties of numerous computer programs which are designed to run on the Apple II computer.\n<714 F.2d 1243> Franklin, the defendant below, manufactures and sells the ACE 100 personal computer and at the time of the hearing employed about 75 people and had sold fewer than 1,000 computers. The ACE 100 was designed to be \u201cApple compatible,\u201d so that peripheral equipment and software developed for use with the Apple II computer could be used in conjunction with the ACE 100. Franklin\u2019s copying of Apple\u2019s operating system computer programs in an effort to achieve such compatibility precipitated this suit.\nLike all computers both the Apple II and ACE 100 have a central processing unit (CPU) which is the integrated circuit that executes programs. In lay terms, the CPU does the work it is instructed to do. Those instructions are contained on computer programs.\nThere are three levels of computer language in which computer programs may be written.2 High level language, such as the commonly used BASIC or FORTRAN, uses English words and symbols, and is relatively easy to learn and understand (e.g., \u201cGO TO 40\u201d tells the computer to skip intervening steps and go to the step at line 40). A somewhat lower level language is assembly language, which consists of alphanumeric labels (e.g., \u201cADC\u201d means \u201cadd with carry\u201d). Statements in high level language, and apparently <219 USPQ 116> also statements in assembly language, are referred to as written in \u201csource code.\u201d The third, or lowest level computer language, is machine language, a binary language using two symbols, 0 and 1, to indicate an open or closed switch (e.g., \u201c01101001\u201d means, to the Apple, add two numbers and save the result). Statements in machine language are referred to as written in \u201cobject code.\u201d\nThe CPU can only follow instructions written in object code. However, programs are usually written in source code which is more intelligible to humans. Programs written in source code can be converted or translated by a \u201ccompiler\u201d program into object code for use by the computer. Programs are generally distributed only in their object code version stored on a memory device.\nA computer program can be stored or fixed on a variety of memory devices, two of which are of particular relevance for this case. The ROM (Read Only Memory) is an internal permanent memory device consisting of a semi-conductor \u201cchip\u201d which is incorporated into the circuitry of the computer. A program in object code is embedded on a ROM before it is incorporated in the computer. Information stored on a ROM can only be read, not erased or rewritten.3 The ACE 100 apparently contains EPROMS (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) on which the stored information can be erased and the chip reprogrammed, but the district court found that for purposes of this proceeding, the difference between ROMs and EPROMs is inconsequential. 545 F. Supp. at 813 n.3, 215 USPQ 935, 938 n.3. The other device used for storing the programs at issue is a diskette or \u201cfloppy disk\u201d, an auxiliary memory device consisting of a flexible magnetic disk resembling a phonograph record, which can be inserted into the computer and from which data or instructions can be read.\nComputer programs can be categorized by function as either application programs or operating system programs. Application programs usually perform a specific task for the computer user, such as word processing, checkbook balancing, or playing a game. In contrast, operating system programs generally manage the internal functions of the computer or facilitate use of application programs. The parties agree that the fourteen computer programs at <714 F.2d 1244> issue in this suit are operating system programs.4\nApple filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania <219 USPQ 117> pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a71338 on May 12, 1982, alleging that Franklin was liable for copyright infringement of the fourteen computer programs, patent infringement, unfair competition, and misappropriation. Franklin\u2019s answer in respect to the copyright counts included the affirmative defense that the programs contained no copyrightable subject matter. Franklin counterclaimed for declaratory judgment that the copyright registrations were invalid and unenforceable, and sought affirmative relief on the basis of Apple\u2019s alleged misuse. Franklin also moved to dismiss eleven of the fourteen copyright infringement counts on the ground that Apple failed to comply with the procedural requirements for suit under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7410, 411.\n<714 F.2d 1245> After expedited discovery, Apple moved for a preliminary injunction to restrain Franklin from using, copying, selling, or infringing Apple\u2019s copyrights. The district court held a three day evidentiary hearing limited to the copyright infringement claims. Apple produced evidence at the hearing in the form of affidavits and testimony that programs sold by Franklin in conjunction with its ACE 100 computer were virtually identical with those covered by the fourteen Apple copyrights. The variations that did exist were minor, consisting merely of such things as deletion of reference to Apple or its copyright notice.5 James Huston, an Apple systems programmer, concluded that the Franklin programs were \u201cunquestionably copied from Apple and could not have been independently created.\u201d He reached this conclusion not only because it is \u201calmost impossible for so many lines of code\u201d to be identically written, but also because his name, which he had embedded in one program (Master Create), and the word \u201cApplesoft\u201d, which was embedded in another (DOS 3.3), appeared on the Franklin master disk. Apple estimated the \u201cworks in suit\u201d took 46 man-months to produce at a cost of over $740,000, not including the time or cost of creating or acquiring earlier versions of the programs or the expense of marketing the programs.\nFranklin did not dispute that it copied the Apple programs. Its witness admitted copying each of the works in suit from the Apple programs. Its factual defense was directed to its contention that it was not feasible for Franklin to write its own operating system programs. David McWherter, now Franklin\u2019s vice-president of engineering, testified he spent 30-40 hours in November 1981 making a study to determine if it was feasible for Franklin to write its own autostart ROM program and concluded it was not because \u201cthere were just too many entry points in relationship to the number of instructions in the program.\u201d Entry points at specific locations in the program can be used by programmers to mesh their application programs with the operating system program. McWherter concluded that use of the identical signals was necessary in order to ensure 100% compatibility with application programs created to run on the Apple computer. He admitted that he never attempted to rewrite Autostart ROM and conceded that some of the works in suit (i.e., Copy, Copy A, Master Create, and Hello) probably could have been rewritten by Franklin. Franklin made no attempt to rewrite any of the programs prior to the lawsuit except for Copy, although McWherter testified that Franklin was \u201cin the process of redesigning\u201d some of the Apple programs and that \u201c[w]e had a fair degree of certainty that that would probably work.\u201d Apple introduced evidence that Franklin could have rewritten programs, including the Autostart ROM program, and that there are in existence operating programs written by third parties which are compatible with Apple II.\nFranklin\u2019s principal defense at the preliminary injunction hearing and before us is primarily a legal one, directed to its contention that the Apple operating system programs are not capable of copyright protection.\nThe district court denied the motion for preliminary injunction by order and opinion dated July 30, 1982. Apple moved for reconsideration in light of this court\u2019s decision in <219 USPQ 118> Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Artic International, Inc., 685 F.2d 870, 215 USPQ 405 (3d Cir. 1982), which was decided August 2, 1982, three days after the district court decision. The district court denied the motion for reconsideration. We have jurisdiction of Apple\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a71292(a)(1).\nIII. The District Court Opinion\n\nIn its opinion, the district court referred to the four factors to be considered <714 F.2d 1246> on request for a preliminary injunction: a reasonable probability of success on the merits; irreparable injury; the improbability of harm to other interested persons; and the public interest. 545 F.Supp. at 825, 215 USPQ at 947; see Delaware River Port Authority v. Transamerican Trailer Transport, Inc., 501 F.2d 917, 919-20 (2d Cir. 1974). The court stated it based its denial of the motion on the first two factors. The court held Apple had not made the requisite showing of likelihood of success on the merits because it \u201cconcluded that there is some doubt as to the copyrightability of the programs described in this litigation.\u201d 545 F. Supp. at 812, 215 USPQ at 935. It also stated that \u201cApple is better suited to withstand whatever injury it might sustain during litigation than is Franklin to withstand the effects of a preliminary injunction\u201d because an injunction would have a \u201cdevastating effect\u201d on Franklin\u2019s business, Id. at 825, 215 USPQ at 947, apparently concluding on that basis that Apple had failed to show irreparable harm.\nIt is difficult to discern precisely why the district court questioned the copyrightability of the programs at issue since there is no finding, statement, or holding on which we can focus which clearly sets forth the district court\u2019s view. Throughout the opinion the district court referred to the \u201ccomplexity of the question presented by the present case\u201d, 545 F. Supp. at 824, 215 USPQ at 947, and the \u201cbaffling\u201d problem at issue. Id. at 822, 215 USPQ at 945.\nThe opinion expresses a series of generalized concerns which may have led the court to its ultimate conclusion, and which the parties and amici treat as holdings. The district court referred to the requirement under the Copyright Act of finding \u201coriginal works of authorship\u201d, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7102(a), and seems to have found that there was a sufficient \u201cmodicum of creativity\u201d to satisfy the statutory requirement of an \u201coriginal work\u201d. 545 F. Supp. at 820-21, 215 USPQ at 943. The court was less clear as to whether the creation of a computer program by a programmer satisfied the requirement of \u201cworks of authorship\u201d, id., and whether an operating system program in \u201cbinary code or one represented either in a ROM or by micro-switches\u201d was an \u201cexpression\u201d which could be copyrighted as distinguished from an \u201cidea\u201d which could not be. Id. at 821, 215 USPQ at 944.\nAgain, although we cannot point to a specific holding, running throughout the district court opinion is the suggestion that programs in object code and ROMs may not be copyrightable. Thus, for example, in a series of discursive footnotes, the district court stated that it found \u201cpersuasive\u201d a district court opinion \u201cholding that object code in ROM is not copyright protected\u201d, 545 F. Supp. at 818 n. 8, 215 USPQ at 941 n.8, (referring to Data Cash Systems, Inc. v. JS&A Group, Inc., 480 F. Supp. 1063, 203 USPQ 735 (N.D. Ill. 1979), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 628 F.2d 1038, 208 USPQ 197 (7th Cir. 1980)); described an opinion reaching a contrary conclusion as containing \u201crather terse analysis [which] provides little guidance\u201d, 545 F. Supp. at 818 n.8, 215 USPQ at 941 n.8 (referring to GCA Corp. v. Chance, 217 USPQ 718 (N.D. Cal. 1982), which followed the reasoning of Tandy Corp. v. Personal Micro Computers, Inc., 524 F. Supp. 171, 214 USPQ 178 (N.D. Cal. 1981)); and stated that \u201cCongressional intent regarding the copyrightability of object codes and ROMs is not clear\u201d, 545 F. Supp. at 819 n.9, 215 USPQ at 942 n.9, and that even among members of the industry it was not clear that the copyright law protects works \u201clike those in suit that are ROM-based,\u201d id. at 819 n.10, 215 USPQ at 942 n.10.\nWe read the district court opinion as presenting the following legal issues: (1) whether copyright can exist in a computer program expressed in object code, (2) whether copyright can exist in a computer program embedded on a ROM, (3) whether copyright can exist in an operating system program, and (4) whether independent irreparable harm must be shown for a preliminary injunction in copyright infringement actions.\nIV. Discussion\n\nA. Copyrightability of a Computer Program Expressed in Object Code\n\nCertain statements by the district court suggest that programs expressed in object <219 USPQ 119><714 F.2d 1247> code, as distinguished from source code, may not be the proper subject of copyright. We find no basis in the statute for any such concern. Furthermore, our decision in Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Artic International, Inc., supra, laid to rest many of the doubts expressed by the district court.\nIn 1976, after considerable study, Congress enacted a new copyright law to replace that which had governed since 1909. Act of October 19, 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-553, 90 Stat. 2541 (codified at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7101 et seq.). Under the law, two primary requirements must be satisfied in order for a work to constitute copyrightable subject matter \u2013 it must be an \u201coriginal wor[k] of authorship\u201d and must be \u201cfixed in [a] tangible medium of expression.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7102(a). The statute provides:\n(a) Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\nId. The statute enumerates seven categories under \u201cworks of authorship\u201d including \u201cliterary works\u201d, defined as follows:\n\u201cLiterary works\u201d are works, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied.\n17 U.S.C. \u00a7101. A work is \u201cfixed\u201d in a tangible medium of expression when:\nits embodiment in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority of the author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration. A work consisting of sounds, images, or both, that are being transmitted, is \u201cfixed\u201d for purposes of this title if a fixation of the work is being made simultaneously with its transmission.\nId.\nAlthough section 102(a) does not expressly list computer programs as works of authorship, the legislative history suggests that programs were considered copyrightable as literary works. See H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 54, reprinted in 1976 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 5659, 5667 (\u201cliterary works\u2019 * * * includes * * * computer programs\u201d). Because a Commission on New Technological Uses (\u201cCONTU\u201d) had been created by Congress to study, inter alia, computer uses of copyrighted works, Pub. L. No. 93-573, \u00a7201, 88 Stat. 1873 (1974), Congress enacted a status quo provision, section 117, in the 1976 Act concerning such computer uses pending the CONTU report and recommendations.6\nThe CONTU Final Report recommended that the copyright law be amended, inter alia, \u201cto make it explicit that computer programs, to the extent that they embody an author\u2019s original creation, are proper subject matter of copyright.\u201d National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works, Final Report 1 (1979) [hereinafter CONTU Report]. CONTU recommended two changes relevant here: that section 117, the status quo provision, be repealed and replaced with a section limiting exclusive rights in computer programs so as \u201cto ensure that rightful possessors of copies of computer programs may use or adapt these copies for their use,\u201d id.; and that a definition of computer program be added to section 101. Id. at 12. Congress adopted both changes. Act of Dec. 12, 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-517, \u00a710, 94 Stat. 3015, 3028. The revisions embodied CONTU\u2019s recommendations to clarify the law of copyright of computer software. H.R. Rep. No. 1307, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 23, reprinted in 1980 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 6460, 6482.\nThe 1980 amendments added a definition of a computer program: <714 F.2d 1248>\nA \u201ccomputer program\u201d is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.\n17 U.S.C. \u00a7101. The amendments also substituted a new section 117 which provides that \u201cit is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program\u201d when necessary to \u201cthe utilization of the computer program\u201d or \u201cfor archival purposes only.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7117. The parties agree that this section is not implicated in the instant law <219 USPQ 120> suit. The language of the provision, however, by carving out an exception to the normal proscriptions against copying, clearly indicates that programs are copyrightable and are otherwise afforded copyright protection.\nWe considered the issue of copyright protection for a computer program in Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Artic International, Inc., and concluded that \u201cthe copyrightability of computer programs is firmly established after the 1980 amendment to the Copyright Act.\u201d 685 F.2d at 875, 215 USPQ at 409. At issue in Williams were not only two audiovisual copyrights to the \u201cattract\u201d and \u201cplay\u201d modes of a video game, but also the computer program which was expressed in object code embodied in ROM and which controlled the sights and sounds of the game. Defendant there had argued \u201cthat when the issue is the copyright on a computer program, a distinction must be drawn between the \u2018source code\u2019 version of a computer program, which * * * can be afforded copyright protection, and the \u2018object code\u2019 stage, which * * * cannot be so protected,\u201d an argument we rejected. Id. at 876, 215 USPQ at 409.\nThe district court here questioned whether copyright was to be limited to works \u201cdesigned to be \u2018read\u2019 by a human reader [as distinguished from] read by an expert with a microscope and patience\u201d, 545 F. Supp. at 821, 215 USPQ at 944. The suggestion that copyrightability depends on a communicative function to individuals stems from the early decision of White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co., 209 U.S. 1 (1908), which held a piano roll was not a copy of the musical composition because it was not in a form others, except perhaps for a very expert few, could perceive. See 1 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a72.03[B][1] (1983). However, it is clear from the language of the 1976 Act and its legislative history that it was intended to obliterate distinctions engendered by White-Smith. H.R. Rep. No. 1476, supra, at 52, reprinted in 1976 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News at 5665.\nUnder the statute, copyright extends to works in any tangible means of expression \u201c from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\u2019\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7102(a) (emphasis added). Further, the definition of \u201ccomputer program\u201d adopted by Congress in the 1980 amendments is \u201csets of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7101 (emphasis added). As source code instructions must be translated into object code before the computer can act upon them, only instructions expressed in object code can be used \u201cdirectly\u201d by the computer. See Midway Manufacturing Co. v. Strohon, No. 82 C 1305, slip op. at 25-26, 219 USPQ 42, 50 (N.D. Ill. June 1, 1983). This definition was adopted following the CONTU Report in which the majority clearly took the position that object codes are proper subjects of copyright. See CONTU Report at 21. The majority\u2019s conclusion was reached although confronted by a dissent based upon the theory that the \u201cmachine-control phase\u201d of a program is not directed at a human audience. See CONTU Report at 28-30 (dissent of Commissioner Hersey).\nThe defendant in Williams had also argued that a copyrightable work \u201cmust be intelligible to human beings and must be intended as a medium of communication to human beings,\u201d id. at 876-77, 215 USPQ at 409. We reiterate the statement we made in Williams when we rejected that argument: \u201c[t]he answer to defendant\u2019s contention is in the words of the statute itself.\u201d 685 F.2d at 877, 215 USPQ at 410.\n<714 F.2d 1249> The district court also expressed uncertainty as to whether a computer program in object code could be classified as a \u201cliterary work.\u201d7 However, the category of \u201cliterary works\u201d, one of the seven copyrightable categories, is not confined to literature in the nature of Hemingway\u2019s For Whom the Bell Tolls. The definition of \u201cliterary works\u201d in section 101 includes expression not only in words but also \u201cnumbers, or other * * * numerical symbols or indicia\u201d, thereby expanding the common usage of \u201cliterary works.\u201d Cf. Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc. v. Graphic Controls Corp., 329 F. Supp. 517, 523-24, 171 USPQ 219, 223-224 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) (the symbols designating questions or response spaces on exam answer sheets held to be copyrightable \u201cwritings\u201d under 1909 Act); Reiss v. National Quotation Bureau, Inc., 276 F. 717 (S.D.N.Y. 1921) (code book of coined words designed for cable use copyrightable). <219 USPQ 121>   Thus a computer program, whether in object code or source code, is a \u201cliterary work\u201d and is protected from unauthorized copying, whether from its object or source code version. Accord Midway Mfg. Co. v. Strohon, slip op. at 25-27, 219 USPQ at 50; see also GCA Corp. v. Chance, 217 USPQ at 719.\nB. Copyrightability of a Computer Program Embedded on a ROM\n\nJust as the district court\u2019s suggestion of a distinction between source code and object code was rejected by our opinion in Williams issued three days after the district court opinion, so also was its suggestion that embodiment of a computer program on a ROM, as distinguished from in a traditional writing, detracts from its copyrightability. In Williams we rejected the argument that \u201ca computer program is not infringed when the program is loaded into electronic memory devices (ROMs) and used to control the activity of machines.\u201d 685 F.2d at 876, 215 USPQ at 409. Defendant there had argued that there can be no copyright protection for the ROMs because they are utilitarian objects or machine parts. We held that the statutory requirement of \u201cfixation\u201d, the manner in which the issue arises, is satisfied through the embodiment of the expression in the ROM devices. Id. at 874, 876, 215 USPQ at 408; See also Midway Mfg. Co. v. Strohon, slip op. at 27-30, 219 USPQ at 51; Tandy Corp. v. Personal Micro Computers, Inc., 524 F. Supp. at 173, 214 USPQ at 179; cf. Stern Electronics, Inc. v. Kaufman, 669 F.2d 852, 855-56, 213 USPQ 443, 445-446 (2d Cir. 1982) (audiovisual display of video game \u201cfixed\u201d in ROM). Therefore we reaffirm that a computer program in object code embedded in a ROM chip is an appropriate subject of copyright. See also Note, Copyright Protection of Computer Program Object Code, 96 Harv. L. Rev. 1723 (1983); Note, Copyright Protection for Computer Programs in Read Only Memory Chips, 11 Hofstra L. Rev. 329 (1982).\nC. Copyrightability of Computer Operating System Programs\n\nWe turn to the heart of Franklin\u2019s position on appeal which is that computer operating system programs, as distinguished from application programs, are not the proper subject of copyright \u201cregardless of the language or medium in which they are fixed.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 15 (emphasis deleted). Apple suggests that this issue too is foreclosed by our Williams decision because some portion of the program at issue there was in effect an operating system program. Franklin is correct that this was not an issue raised by the parties in Williams and it was not considered by the <714 F.2d 1250> court. Thus we consider it as a matter of first impression.\nFranklin contends that operating system programs are per se excluded from copyright protection under the express terms of section 102(b) of the Copyright Act, and under the precedent and underlying principles of Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99 (1879). These separate grounds have substantial analytic overlap.\nIn Baker v. Selden, plaintiff\u2019s testator held a copyright on a book explaining a bookkeeping system which included blank forms with ruled lines and headings designed for use with that system. Plaintiff sued for copyright infringement on the basis of defendant\u2019s publication of a book containing a different arrangement of the columns and different headings, but which used a similar plan so far as results were concerned. The Court, in reversing the decree for the plaintiff, concluded that blank account-books were not the subject of copyright and that \u201cthe mere copyright of Selden\u2019s book did not confer upon him the exclusive right to make and use account-books, ruled and arranged as designated by him and described and illustrated in said book.\u201d Id. at 107. The Court stated that copyright of the books did not give the plaintiff the exclusive right to use the system explained in the books, noting, for example, that \u201ccopyright of a work on mathematical science cannot give to the author an exclusive right to the methods of operation which he propounds.\u201d Id. at 103.\nFranklin reads Baker v. Selden as \u201cstand[ing] for several fundamental principles, each presenting * * * an insuperable obstacle to the copyrightability of Apple\u2019s operating systems.\u201d It states:\nFirst, Baker teaches that use of a system itself does not infringe a copyright on the description of the system. Second, Baker enunciates the rule that copyright does not extend to purely utilitarian works. Finally, Baker emphasizes that the copyright laws may not be used to obtain and hold a monopoly over an idea. In so doing, Baker highlights the principal difference between the copyright and patent laws \u2013 a difference that is highly pertinent in this case.\nBrief of Appellee at 22.\nSection 102(b) of the Copyright Act, the other ground on which Franklin relies, <219 USPQ 122> appeared first in the 1976 version, long after the decision in Baker v. Selden. It provides:\nIn no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\nIt is apparent that section 102(b) codifies a substantial part of the holding and dictum of Baker v. Selden. See 1 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a72.18[D], at 2-207.\nWe turn to consider the two principal points of Franklin\u2019s argument.\n1. \u201cProcess\u201d, \u201cSystem\u201d or \u201cMethod of Operation\u201d\n\nFranklin argues that an operating system program is either a \u201cprocess\u201d, \u201csystem\u201d, or \u201cmethod of operation\u201d and hence uncopyrightable.8 Franklin correctly notes that underlying section 102(b) and many of the statements for which Baker v. Selden is cited is the distinction which must be made between property subject to the patent law, which protects discoveries, and that subject to copyright law, which protects the writings describing such discoveries. However, <714 F.2d 1251> Franklin\u2019s argument misapplies that distinction in this case. Apple does not seek to copyright the method which instructs the computer to perform its operating functions but only the instructions themselves. The method would be protected, if at all, by the patent law, an issue as yet unresolved. See Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175 (1981).\nFranklin\u2019s attack on operating system programs as \u201cmethods\u201d or \u201cprocesses\u201d seems inconsistent with its concession that application programs are an appropriate subject of copyright. Both types of programs instruct the computer to do something. Therefore, it should make no difference for purposes of section 102(b) whether these instructions tell the computer to help prepare an income tax return (the task of an application program) or to translate a high level language program from source code into its binary language object code form (the task of an operating system program such as \u201cApplesoft\u201d, see note 4 supra). Since it is only the instructions which are protected, a \u201cprocess\u201d is no more involved because the instructions in an operating system program may be used to activate the operation of the computer than it would be if instructions were written in ordinary English in a manual which described the necessary steps to activate an intricate complicated machine. There is, therefore, no reason to afford any less copyright protection to the instructions in an operating system program than to the instructions in an application program.\nFranklin\u2019s argument, receptively treated by the district court, that an operating system program is part of a machine mistakenly focuses on the physical characteristics of the instructions. But the medium is not the message. We have already considered and rejected aspects of this contention in the discussion of object code and ROM. The mere fact that the operating system program may be etched on a ROM does not make the program either a machine, part of a machine or its equivalent. Furthermore, as one of Franklin\u2019s witnesses testified, an operating system does not have to be permanently in the machine in ROM, but it may be on some other medium, such as a diskette or magnetic tape, where it could be readily transferred into the temporary memory space of the computer. In fact, some of the operating systems at issue were on diskette. As the CONTU majority stated.\nPrograms should no more be considered machine parts than videotapes should be considered parts of projectors or phonorecords parts of sound reproduction equipment.* * *That the words of a program are used ultimately in the implementation of a process should in no way affect their copyrightability.\nCONTU Report at 21.\nFranklin also argues that the operating systems cannot be copyrighted because they are \u201cpurely utilitarian works\u201d and that Apple is seeking to block the use of the art embodied in its operating systems. This argument stems from the following dictum in Baker v. Selden:\nThe very object of publishing a book on science or the useful arts is to communicate to the world the useful knowledge which it contains. But this object would be frustrated <219 USPQ 123> if the knowledge could not be used without incurring the guilt of piracy of the book. And where the art it teaches cannot be used without employing the methods and diagrams used to illustrate the book, or such as are similar to them, such methods and diagrams are to be considered as necessary incidents to the art, and given therewith to the public; not given for the purpose of publication in other works explanatory of the art, but for the purpose of practical application.\n101 U.S. at 103. We cannot accept the expansive reading given to this language by some courts, see, e.g., Taylor Instrument Companies v. Fawley-Brost Co., 139 F.2d 989, 59 USPQ 384 (7th Cir. 1943), cert. denied, 321 U.S. 785, 60 USPQ 579 (1944). In this respect we agree with the views expressed by Professor Nimmer in his treatise. See 1 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a72.18[C].\n<714 F.2d 1252> Although a literal construction of this language could support Franklin\u2019s reading that precludes copyrightability if the copyright work is put to a utilitarian use, that interpretation has been rejected by a later Supreme Court decision. In Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 218, 100 USPQ 325 (1954), the Court stated: \u201cWe find nothing in the copyright statute to support the argument that the intended use or use in industry of an article eligible for copyright bars or invalidates its registration. We do not read such a limitation into the copyright law.\u201d Id. at 218, 100 USPQ at 333. The CONTU majority also rejected the expansive view some courts have given Baker v. Selden, and stated, \u201cThat the words of program are used ultimately in the implementation of a process should in no way affect their copyrightability.\u201d Id. at 21. It referred to \u201ccopyright practice past and present, which recognizes copyright protection for a work of authorship regardless of the uses to which it may be put.\u201d Id. The Commission continued: \u201cThe copyright status of the written rules for a game or a system for the operation of a machine is unaffected by the fact that those rules direct the actions of those who play the game or carry out the process.\u2019\u201d Id. (emphasis added). As we previously noted, we can consider the CONTU Report as accepted by Congress since Congress wrote into the law the majority\u2019s recommendations almost verbatim. See 18 Cong. Rec. H10767 (daily ed. Nov. 17, 1980) (Rep. Kastenmeier: Bill \u201celiminates confusion about the legal status of computer software by enacting the recommendations of [CONTU] clarifying the law of copyright of computer software\u201d); 18 Cong. Rec. S14766 (daily ed. Nov. 20, 1980) (Sen. Bayh: \u201c[t]his language reflects that proposed by [CONTU\u201d]).\nPerhaps the most convincing item leading us to reject Franklin\u2019s argument is that the statutory definition of a computer program as a set of instructions to be used in a computer in order to bring about a certain result, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7101, makes no distinction between application programs and operating programs. Franklin can point to no decision which adopts the distinction it seeks to make. In the one other reported case to have considered it, Apple Computer, Inc. v. Formula International, Inc., 562 F. Supp. 775, 218 USPQ 47 (C.D. Cal. 1983), the court reached the same conclusion which we do, i.e. that an operating system program is not per se precluded from copyright. It stated, \u201cThere is nothing in any of the statutory terms which suggest a different result for different types of computer programs based upon the function they serve within the machine.\u201d Id. at 780, 218 at 51. Other courts have also upheld the copyrightability of operating programs without discussion of this issue. See Tandy Corp. v. Personal Micro Computers, INc., 524 F. Supp. at 173, 214 USPQ at 179 (input-output routine stored in ROM which translated input into machine language in a similar fashion as Applesoft and Apple Integer Basic proper subject of copyright); GCA Corp. v. Chance, 217 USPQ at 719 (object code version of registered source code version of operating programs is the same work and protected).\n2. Idea/Expression Dichotomy\n\nFranklin\u2019s other challenge to copyright of operating system programs relies on the line which is drawn between ideas and their expression. Baker v. Selden remains a benchmark in the law of copyright for the reading given it in Mazer v. Stein, supra, where the Court stated, \u201cUnlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression of the idea \u2013 not the idea itself.\u201d 347 U.S. at 217, 100 USPQ 333 (footnote omitted).\nThe expression/idea dichotomy is now expressly recognized in section 102(b) which precludes copyright for \u201cany idea.\u201d This provision was not intended to enlarge or contract the scope of copyright protection but \u201cto restate * * * that the basic dichotomy between expression and idea remains unchanged.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 1476, supra, at 57, reprinted in 1976 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News at 5670. The legislative history indicates that section 102(b) was intended \u201cto make clear that the expression adopted by the programmer is the copyrightable element <714 F.2d 1253> in a computer program, and that the actual processes <219 USPQ 124> or methods embodied in the program are not within the scope of the copyright law.\u201d Id.\nMany of the courts which have sought to draw the line between an idea and expression have found difficulty in articulating where it falls. See, e.g., Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119, 121, 7 USPQ 84, 86 (2d Cir. 1930) (L. Hand, J.); see discussion in 3 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a713.03[A]. We believe that in the context before us, a program for an operating system, the line must be a pragmatic one, which also keeps in consideration \u201cthe preservation of the balance between competition and protection reflected in the patent and copyright laws\u201d. Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Kalpakian, 446 F.2d 738, 742, 170 USPQ 557, 559 (9th Cir. 1971). As we stated in Franklin Mint Corp. v. National Wildlife Art Exchange, Inc., 575 F.2d 62, 64, 197 USPQ 721, 723 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 880, 199 USPQ 57 (1978), \u201cUnlike a patent, a copyright protects originality rather than novelty or invention.\u201d In that opinion, we quoted approvingly the following passage from Dymow v. Bolton, 11 F.2d 690, 691 (2d Cir. 1926).\nJust as a patent affords protection only to the means of reducing an inventive idea to practice, so the copyright law protects the means of expressing an idea; and it is as near the whole truth as generalization can usually reach that, if the same idea can be expressed in a plurality of totally different manners, a plurality of copyrights may result, and no infringement will exist.\n(emphasis added).\nWe adopt the suggestion in the above language and thus focus on whether the idea is capable of various modes of expression. If other programs can be written or created which perform the same function as an Apple\u2019s operating system program, then that program is an expression of the idea and hence copyrightable. In essence, this inquiry is no different than that made to determine whether the expression and idea have merged, which has been stated to occur where there are no or few other ways of expressing a particular idea. See, e.g., Morrissey v. Procter & Gamble Co., 379 F.2d 675, 678-79, 154 USPQ 193, 194-95 (1st Cir. 1967); Freedman v. Grolier Enterprises, Inc., 179 USPQ 476, 478 (S.D.N.Y. 1973) (\u201c[c]opyright protection will not be given to a form of expression necessarily dictated by the underlying subject matter\u201d); CONTU Report at 20.\nThe district court made no findings as to whether some or all of Apple\u2019s operating programs represent the only means of expression of the idea underlying them. Although there seems to be a concession by Franklin that at least some of the programs can be rewritten, we do not believe that the record on that issue is so clear that it can be decided at the appellate level. Therefore, if the issue is pressed on remand, the necessary finding can be made at that time.\nFranklin claims that whether or not the programs can be rewritten, there are a limited \u201cnumber of ways to arrange operating systems to enable a computer to run the vast body of Apple-compatible software,\u201d Brief of Appellee at 20. This claim has no pertinence to either the idea/expression dichotomy or merger. The idea which may merge with the expression, thus making the copyright unavailable, is the idea which is the subject of the expression. The idea of one of the operating system programs is, for example, how to translate source code into object code. If other methods of expressing that idea are not foreclosed as a practical matter, then there is no merger. Franklin may wish to achieve total compatibility with independently developed application programs written for the Apple II, but that is a commercial and competitive objective which does not enter into the somewhat metaphysical issue of whether particular ideas and expressions have merged.\nIn summary, Franklin\u2019s contentions that operating system programs are per se not copyrightable is unpersuasive. The other courts before whom this issue has been raised have rejected the distinction. Neither the CONTU majority nor Congress made a distinction between operating and application programs. We believe that the <714 F.2d 1254> 1980 amendments reflect Congress\u2019 receptivity to new technology and its desire to encourage, through the copyright laws, continued imagination and creativity in computer programming. Since we believe that the district court\u2019s decision on the preliminary injunction was, to a large part, influenced by an erroneous view of the availability of copyright for operating system programs and unnecessary concerns about object code and ROMs, we must reverse the denial of the preliminary injunction and remand for reconsideration.\nD. Irreparable Harm\n\nThe district court, without any extended discussion, found that Apple had not made the requisite showing of irreparable harm, stating \u201cApple is better suited to withstand whatever injury it might sustain during litigation than is Franklin to withstand the <219 USPQ 125> effects of a preliminary injunction.\u201d 545 F. Supp. at 812, 825, 215 USPQ at 937. In so ruling, the district court failed to consider the prevailing view that a showing of a prima facie case of copyright infringement or reasonable likelihood of success on the merits raises a presumption of irreparable harm. See, e.g., Atari, Inc. v. North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp., 672 F.2d 607, 620 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 103 S.Ct. 176 (1982); Wainwright Securities Inc. v. Wall Street Transcript Corp., 558 F.2d 91, 94, 194 USPQ 401, 402 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014, 196 USPQ 864 (1978); Klitzner Industries, Inc. v. H.K. James & Co., 535 F. Supp. 1249, 1259, 216 USPQ 73, 80 (E.D. Pa. 1982); Custom Decor, Inc. v. Nautical Crafts Inc., 502 F. Supp. 154, 157, 213 USPQ 565, 567 (E.D. Pa. 1980). A copyright plaintiff who makes out a prima facie case of infringement is entitled to a preliminary injunction without a detailed showing of irreparable harm. See 3 Nimmer on Copyright \u00a714.06[A], at 14-50, 14-51 & n.16 (collecting authorities).\nThe CONTU Final Report recognized that \u201c[t]he cost of developing computer programs is far greater than the cost of their duplication.\u201d CONTU Report at 11. Apple introduced substantial evidence of the considerable time and money it had invested in the development of the computer programs in suit. Thus even without the presumption of irreparable harm generally applied in copyright infringement cases, the jeopardy to Apple\u2019s investment and competitive position caused by Franklin\u2019s wholesale copying of many of its key operating programs would satisfy the requirement of irreparable harm needed to support a preliminary injunction. See Atari, Inc. v. North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp., 672 F.2d at 620; Custom Decor, Inc. v. Nautical Crafts Inc., 502 F. Supp. 154, 157, 213 USPQ 565, 567 (E.D. Pa. 1980); Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Zale Corp., 323 F. Supp. 1234, 1238, 169 USPQ 393, 395 (S.D. N.Y. 1971).\nIn Kontes Glass Co. v. Lab Glass, Inc., 373 F.2d 319, 320-21, 152 USPQ 654, 655 (3d Cir. 1967), this court appeared to adopt an inverse relationship approach to the irreparable harm issue, suggesting that the strength of the required showing of irreparable injury varies inversely with the strength of plaintiff\u2019s showing of a likelihood of success on the merits. See Midway Mfg. Co. v. Bandai-America, Inc., 546 F.Supp. 125, 141-42, 216 USPQ 812, 829 (D.N.J. 1982). In Kontes, we were not presented with a case in which copyrighted material central to the essence of plaintiff\u2019s operations was concededly copied, as we are here. We believe the Kontes approach is best suited to those cases where the injury from copying can be fairly considered minimal, limited or conjectural. In those circumstances it provides flexibility in applying the equitable remedy of preliminary injunctions through evaluation of the irreparable harm factor. Normally, however, the public interest underlying the copyright law requires a presumption of irreparable harm, as long as there is, as here, adequate evidence of the expenditure of significant time, effort and money directed to the production of the copyrighted material. Otherwise, the rationale for protecting copyright, that of encouraging creativity, would be undermined. As Judge Broderick stated in Klitzner Industries, Inc. v. H.K. James & Co., 535 F.Supp. at 1259-60, 216 USPQ 73, 81: <714 F.2d 1255>\nSince Congress has elected to grant certain exclusive rights to the owner of a copyright in a protected work, it is virtually axiomatic that the public interest can only be served by upholding copyright protections and, correspondingly, preventing the misappropriation of the skills, creative energies, and resources which are invested in the protected work.\nNor can we accept the district court\u2019s explanation which stressed the \u201cdevastating effect\u201d of a preliminary injunction on Franklin\u2019s business. If that were the correct standard, then a knowing infringer would be permitted to construct its business around its infringement, a result we cannot condone. See Atari, Inc. v. North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp., 672 F.2d at 620; cf. Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. v. Church & Dwight Co., 560 F.2d 1325, 1333, 195 USPQ 218, 223 (7th Cir. 1977) (trademark infringement), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1070, 197 USPQ 592 (1978). The size of the infringer should not be determinative of the copyright holder\u2019s ability to get prompt judicial redress.\nE. Additional Issues\n\nFranklin has raised a number of issues concerning Apple\u2019s compliance with various statutory formalities such as registration, notice and deposit. It has challenged, in a pending motion to dismiss, the copyrights of the eleven works in suit which were deposited in object code format, and which were registered under the Copyright Office\u2019s \u201crule of <219 USPQ 126> doubt.\u201d9 Franklin challenges three programs, i.e. Apple Integer Basic, Autostart ROM and DOS 3.3, on the ground that they or their predecessors were published without the requisite notice. We do not reach these issues on appeal nor do we consider Franklin\u2019s claim that Apple\u2019s misuse of its copyrights bars their enforcement. The district court did not consider these claims in denying the motion for preliminary injunction. There are no factual findings with regard to them. On remand, they can be considered by the district court in the first instance who can also decide the extent to which they are relevant, if at all, to a preliminary injunction.\nV.\n\nFor the reasons set forth in this opinion, we will reverse the denial of the preliminary injunction and remand to the district court for further proceedings in accordance herewith.\n\n1 Four amicus curiae briefs have been submitted; briefs from Digital Research Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. (a trade association for the computer services industry), support the position of Apple, and a brief from Pro-Log Corp. supports at least part of Franklin\u2019s position.\n2 Useful nontechnical descriptions of computer operations appear in Note, Copyright Protection for Computer Programs In Read Only Memory Chips, 11 Hofstra L. Rev. 329 (1982), and Note, Copyright Protection of Computers Program Object Code, 96 Harv. L. Rev. 1723 (1983).\n3 Footnote 3. In contrast to the permanent memory devices a RAM (Random Access Memory) is a chip on which volatile internal memory is stored which is erased when the computer\u2019s power is turned off.\n\n4 The fourteen programs at issue, briefly described, are:\n(1) Autostart ROM is sold as part of the Apple Computer and is embedded on a ROM chip. The program has also been published in source code as part of a copyrighted book, the Apple II manual. When the computer\u2019s power is turned on, Autostart ROM performs internal routines that turn on the circuits in the computer and make its physical parts (e.g. input/output devices, screen, and memory) ready for use.\n(2) Applesoft is Apple\u2019s version of the Beginner\u2019s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) language. The program is stored in ROM and is sold as part of the computer. Applesoft translates instructions written in the higher-level BASIC language into the lower-level machine code that the computer understands.\n(3) Floating-Point BASIC is the same program as Applesoft but is stored on disks rather than on ROMs. It is used in earlier versions of the Apple II computer that did not have the Applesoft program in ROM.\n(4) Apple Integer BASIC, another translator program, is stored on the DOS 3.3 Master Disk. This program used Apple\u2019s first version of BASIC for the Apple II computer. It implements a simpler version of the Applesoft program.\n(5) DOS 3.3, the disk operating system program, provides the instructions necessary to control the operation between the disk system (disk drive) and the computer itself. It controls the reading and writing functions of the disks and includes other routines which put all the data transfers in sequence. The DOS 3.3 Master Disk is sold separately from the computer, and includes several of the other operating programs referred to in this note.\n(6) Master Create is stored on a disk. When a disk is prepared for use the DOS 3.3 program is placed on that disk in a form that is dependent on the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) available. The Master Create program replaces the DOS 3.3 on the disk with a version that is independent of the amount of RAM available.\n(7) Copy, which is stored on a disk, enables the user to copy programs written in Apple Integer BASIC from one disk to another.\n(8) Copy A, also stored on a disk, enables the user to copy programs written in Applesoft from one disk to another.\n(9) Copy OBJO contains a file of subroutines used by the Copy and Copy A programs.\n(10) Chain, another disk stored program, allows data to be passed between different parts of a program when only one part of the program is in RAM at a given time. Thus, Chain preserves data already stored in RAM while another part of the program is being loaded into RAM.\n(11) Hello, also disk stored, is the first program executed after the power is turned on and a disk is ready for use. It determines how much RAM is in the computer and which version of BASIC needs to be loaded into the computer.\n(12) Boot 13 is stored on disk and sold on a Master Disk. It allows the user having a disk controller card that contains the Apple 16-Sector Boot ROM to use older versions of the Apple disk operating system.\n(13) Apple 13-Sector Boot ROM is stored in a ROM located on the disk controller card plugged into the Mother Board. By turning on numerous circuits on the card and in the Apple II computer, this program causes other parts of the disk operating system used for 13-Sector format disks to load.\n(14) Apple 16-Sector Boot ROM, stored in a ROM located on the disk controller card, turns on numerous circuits on the card and in the Apple II computer and causes other parts of the disk operating system used for 16-Sector format disks to load. It therefore enables the user to start or permit the running of another program or to prepare the computer to receive a program.\nThe above descriptions represent an effort to translate the language used by computer experts into language reasonably intelligible to lay persons. They differ in some respects from the descriptions in the district court\u2019s opinion, 545 F. Supp. at 815-16, 215 USPQ at 939 which were taken from the complaint.\n5 For example, 8 bytes of memory were altered in the Autostart ROM program so that when the computer is turned on \u201cACE 100\u201d appears on the screen rather than \u201cApple II.\u201d The Franklin DOS 3.3 program also had 16 bytes (out of 9000) that allowed use of upper and lower case.\n\n6 Section 117 applied only to the scope of protection to be accorded copyrighted works when used in conjunction with a computer and not to the copyrightability of programs. H.R. Rep. No. 1476, at 116, reprinted in 1976 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News at 5731.\n\n7 The district court stated that a programmer working directly in object code appears to think more as a mathematician or engineer, that the process of constructing a chip is less a work of authorship than the product of engineering knowledge, and that it may be more apt to describe an encoded ROM as a pictorial three-dimensional object than as a literary work. 545 F. Supp. at 821-22, 215 USPQ at 944. The district court\u2019s remarks relied in part on a quotation about \u201cmicrocode\u201d, see id. at 821 in 14, 215 USPQ at 944 n. 14; Apple introduced testimony that none of the works in suit contain \u201cmicrocode.\u201d Moreover, Apple does not seek to protect the ROM\u2019s architecture but only the program encoded upon it.\n\n8 We are unpersuaded by Franklin\u2019s initial contention that Apple is bound to this position because some of Apple\u2019s witnesses in the preliminary injunction hearing used these terms in describing the works in suit. As the CONTU Report itself recognized, the distinction between copyrightable computer programs and uncopyrightable processes or methods of operation does not always seem to \u201cshimmer with clarity.\u201d CONTU Report at 18. The witnesses undoubtedly had the not uncommon difficulty of finding the precisely correct words of description in this field. It would be both unreasonable and arbitrary to consider the statements of non-lawyer witnesses without experience in using statutory language as words of art to be binding admissions against Apple.\n\n9 Apparently the Register of Copyrights utilizes its rule of doubt when the deposit of a computer program is made in object code form because its examiners cannot interpret such code to

Willen, Wilson Sansini Goodrich & Rosati, New York, NY, Michael R. Petrocelli, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, San Francisco, CA, for Defendant.\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nRoyce C. Lamberth, United States District Judge.\n\nNow before the Court is defendant's motion to dismiss, plaintiff's opposition, and defendant's reply. ECF Nos. 13, 18, & 21. For the reasons stated below and by separate order issued this date, defendant's motion shall be GRANTED.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nThe facts set out herein are either undisputed, or are as alleged by plaintiff. The Court, in keeping with its responsibilities under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) accepts as true all factual allegations set forth by plaintiff for purposes of this motion.\n\na. Plaintiff's role in collecting royalties under the Copyright Act\n\nPlaintiff is a nonprofit organization, with statutory authority under, inter alia, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(g) and 37 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 370, 382, and 384, as designated by the Copyright Royalty Judges. Compl., ECF No. 1, at 3; 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 801. Plaintiff filed the complaint in this case as the \"sole entity designated by regulation\" to \"collect statutory license payments from copyright users and to distribute those payments to performing artists and copyright owners.\" Compl. 2. Section 114 contains various provisions making plaintiff, as the designated nonprofit agent, responsible for administrating and distributing statutory royalties and enforcing statutory licenses. The Copyright Act provides these statutory licenses as \"an alternative to having every music service negotiate separate licenses with every copyright owner,\" under \u00a7 112(e) and (d)(2). Compl. 4. Those companies which make use of such statutory licenses pay royalties at rates set by Copyright Royalty Judge under \u00a7\u00a7 112(e)(3) and 114(f). Accordingly, defendant (as well as other entities utilizing statutory licenses) are obligated to make payments to plaintiff under the aforementioned statutory licenses. Compl. 2.\n\nb. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act\n\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") established a new statutory scheme to determine royalties under Title 17 of the United States Code. Pub. L. No. 105-304, 112 Stat. 2860 (Oct. 28, 1998); 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101, et seq.; Compl. 1; Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 9-11. The new standard for calculating royalty rates under the DMCA should reflect what \"would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(f)(2)(B). This is referred to as the willing buyer/willing seller standard. While the DMCA established new standards for determining royalty rates, it also created an exception for preexisting subscription services (\"PSS\" or \"PES\"). 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(j)(11). Defendant and two other entities were grandfathered under this exception. Compl. 6. PSS are not subject to the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard, but instead enjoy generally favorable royalty rates. Compl. 5-6. The lower PSS rates give the PSS a competitive advantage over non-PSS. Compl. 6; Pl.'s Opp. Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 11.\n\nc. Muzak\n\nDefendant is the provider of \"a subscription-based digital music service for various satellite and cable television providers.\" Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 6. Defendant provided digital music service available to consumers as music channels transmitted with Dish satellite television service (\"Dish\") packages under the name DishCD. Compl. 149*149 1 & 9. DishCD consists generally of audio-only content transmitted on certain channels of Dish Network (\"Dish\"), a multichannel video programming distributor (\"MVPD\") under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(13). Compl. 1-2. As such, defendant was one of the first entities to utilize the statutory licensing scheme provided under \u00a7 114(d)(2). Compl. 1. In 1998, under the DMCA, Congress revised the statutory licensing provisions, granting several entities status as PSS. Pub. L. No. 105-304, 112 Stat. 2860 (Oct. 28, 1998). Defendant was specifically identified as a PSS in the legislative history of the DMCA, and has continued to operate as such within the statutory definition of PSS. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(j)(11); H.R. Conf. Rep. 105-796, 105th Cong., 2nd Sess., 657 (1998).\n\nd. DMX\n\nDMX, as \"DMX (operated by TCI Music)\" was also originally designated as a PSS in 1998. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(j)(11); H.R. Conf. Rep. 105-796, 105th Cong., 2nd Sess., 657 (1998); Compl. 10. By 2006, DMX business and offerings had been restructured and the resultant entity no longer claimed the PSS rates. Compl. 10; Designation as a Preexisting Subscription Service, 71 Fed. Reg. 64,639-1 (Nov. 3, 2006). After 2006, DMX, or the entities offering music services under the DMX brand name, made statutory royalty payments to plaintiff under the new subscription service rate. Compl. 10. DMX began offering a new brand, SonicTap, in 2010, which provided subscription packages for DirecTV satellite television at the new subscription service rates (the willing buyer/willing seller standard) rather than the PSS rates. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(f)(2)(B); Compl. 10; Pl.'s Opp. Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 13-14.\n\ne. Acquisition of Muzak and DMX\n\nMood Media Corporation (\"Mood\") acquired Muzak in 2011. Compl. 9. In 2012, Mood also acquired DMX Holdings, Inc., which was the provider of DMX services (specifically, SonicTap on DirecTV). Compl. 10. When Mood acquired DMX, SonicTap was making royalty payments at the new subscription service rate. Compl. 10. Defendant acquired the right to provide audio-only channels to DMX's previous customers effective May 1, 2014. Compl. 10; Pl.'s Opp. Def.'s Mot. Dimiss 14. Defendant notified plaintiff of the acquisition and intent to utilize the PSS rate, then continued to make royalty payments for the services that were previously provided by DMX, specifically the SonicTap services, at the PSS rate. Compl. 10-11. Plaintiff asked defendant for clarification as to why defendant believed that these services qualified for the PSS royalty rates, to which defendant replied it was \"eligible to pay royalties as a [PSS] for all of its activities...\" Compl. 11. In May 2014, DMX ceased independently making royalty payments to plaintiff; at the same time defendant began making royalty payments at a higher rate. Compl. 11. Presumably, the higher payment reflects defendant making royalty payments for providing the services it began making that were previously made by DMX.\n\nII. ANALYSIS\n\nThe parties dispute whether defendant is entitled to utilize the PSS royalty rate for certain services it provides to customers previously served by DMX Holdings, Inc.'s SonicTap. The parties do not appear to dispute the material fact recited herein. Instead, the issue appears to be one of statutory interpretation.\n\na. Jurisdiction and Venue\n\nJurisdiction is appropriate under the Copyright Act and Title 28 of the U.S. Code. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, et seq.; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a). The Court accepts, for the purposes of this motion, plaintiff's undisputed factual allegations 150*150 that venue is proper due to defendant's sufficient contacts with the district, as well as the allegation that a substantial part of the events giving rise to the dispute occurred within the district. Compl. 2; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b)(1) & (b)(2).\n\nb. Standard of Review \u2014 Motion to Dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)\n\nDefendant moves to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In order to withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the complaint must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, in order to give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (internal quotations marks and citations omitted). Further, in ruling on a motion to dismiss, the D.C. Circuit notes that the court will generally, \"accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.\" Atherton v. Dist. of Columbia, 567 F.3d 672, 681 (D.C.Cir.2009). This does not mean that the court must accept \"threadbare recitals of a cause of action's elements, supported by mere conclusory statements.\" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).\n\nc. DMCA, \u00a7 114(j)(11)\n\nThe parties disagree on whether defendant can continue to utilize the PSS royalty rate with regard to the portion of services transferred from DMX (primarily SonicTap). Compl. 9-11; Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 10.\n\nThe DMCA provides the following definition of PSS:\n\nA \"preexisting subscription service\" is a service that performs sound recordings by means of noninteractive audio-only subscription digital audio transmissions, which was in existence and was making such transmissions to the public for a fee on or before July 31, 1998, and may include a limited number of sample channels representative of the subscription service that are made available on a nonsubscription basis in order to promote the subscription service.\n17 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(j)(11) (2015). There are two relevant clauses in \u00a7 114(j)(11). First, \"a service that performs sounds recordings by means of noninteractive audio-only subscription digital audio transmissions.\" The next clause that is relevant is the language, \"which was in existence and was making such transmissions to the public for a fee on or before July 31, 1998.\" \u00a7 114(j)(11).\n\nd. Statutory Interpretation\n\nThe parties differ in their interpretation of how \u00a7 114(j)(11) applies the grandfathering provision. Defendant contends that the plain text of the statute yields a two-part analysis to determine whether status as a PSS is granted under the DMCA; first, that the service provides sound recordings by \"noninteractive audio-only\" means, and second, that it has been providing \"such transmissions\" since July 31, 1998. Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 16 (citing \u00a7 114(j)(11)). Defendant argues that this is a disjunctive test and therefore that it can meet each criteria separately to qualify for PSS rates. Def.'s Mot. Dismiss at 11-12. Defendant argues that a plain reading of the statute reveals that the language \"such transmissions\" means the type of transmissions laid out in the beginning of that sentence, or \"noninteractive audio-only subscription digital audio transmissions,\" regardless of whether provided to the same customers, or a different group of 151*151 customers. Def.'s Reply Pl.'s Opp. Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 6-8 (citing 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(j)(11) (2015)).\n\nConversely, plaintiff comprehends \u00a7 114(j)(11) to impose a conjunctive two-part requirement. Pl.'s Opp. Def.'s Mot. Dismiss, 7-8. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that the PSS royalty only applies to PSS at the time of the DMCA's enactment and only for their services provided at that same time that qualified for the PSS royalty rate. Id. In other words, \"[t]o benefit from PSS rates ... a licensee had to be the same business entity that secured the statutory license prior to July 31, 1998....\" Pl.'s Opp. Def.'s Mot. Dismiss 12. When it comes to \"such transmissions,\" plaintiff interprets this phrase as requiring the PSS to be making exactly the same transmissions as it was on July 31, 1998. Pl.'s Opp. Def.'s Mot Dismiss 17. Put another way, plaintiff is interpreting the word \"such\" to mean \"the same\" or \"identical\" transmissions to the same set of customers. Id.\n\nThe \"first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.\" Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997). The Robinson court noted that \"[o]ur inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous ....\" Id. The difference between the parties comes down to whether the entity which qualified as a PSS can make the same type of transmissions contemplated by \u00a7 114(j)(11) to new customers and retain the PSS royalty rate for the additional transmissions. To determine whether Congress intended for the PSS rate to apply in this manner, the Court examines the rest of the statute.\n\nThere are other provisions in the statute that make clear Congress's intent for PSS to be able to expand their businesses in certain ways yet remain under the PSS royalty scheme. In \u00a7 114(f)(1)(C), the statute provides that a copyright owner or PSS can initiate procedures under \u00a7 114(f)(1)(A) or (B) \"indicating that a new type of subscription digital audio transmission service on which sound recordings are performed is or is about to become operational...\" in order to determine whether such service should fall under the PSS royalty rates as established by the Copyright Royalty Judges pursuant to \u00a7 114(f)(1)(A) or (B). Subsection 114(f)(1) thus provides a mechanism for the PSS to notify the appropriate authority that there is a new type of service and essentially obtain a ruling about whether transmissions on this new type of service may also fall under the PSS rate. This provision, therefore, is clear evidence that Congress did at least intend for a PSS to be able to provide the some \"new type\" of service and still utilize the PSS royalty rate.\n\ne. Legislative History and the 2006 Decision\n\nThough the Court need rely on the legislative history of \u00a7 114, nor look to the Register of Copyrights' 2006 decision, it sees its ruling today as consistent with the Register's analysis as well as \u00a7 114's legislative history. H.R. Conf. Rep. 105-796, 105th Cong., 2nd Sess. (1998); U.S. Copyright Office, Designation as a Preexisting Subscription Service, 71 Fed. Reg. 64,639-1 1 (Nov. 3, 2006). To wit, the conference report describes a PSS as \"making transmissions to the public on or before July 31, 1998, and which is making transmissions similar in character to such transmissions made on or before July 31, 1998.\" H.R. Conf. Rep. 105-796 at 89 (1998) (emphasis added). Next, the report notes:\n\n... the conferee's objective was to limit the grandfather to their existing services in the same transmission medium 152*152 and to any new services in a new transmission medium where only transmissions similar to their existing service are provided. Thus, if a cable subscription music service making transmissions on July 31, 1998, were to offer the same music service through the Internet, then such Internet service would be considered part of a preexisting subscription service.\nId. The operative language here is \"to any new services in a new transmission medium where only transmissions similar to their existing service are provided.\" Id. Immediately following that, the report provides:\n\nIf, however, a subscription service making transmissions on July 31, 1998, were to offer a new service either in the same or new transmission medium by taking advantages of the capabilities of that medium, such new service would not qualify as a preexisting subscription service. For example, a service that offers video programming, such as advertising or other content, would not qualify as a preexisting service, provided that the video programming is not merely information about the service itself, the sound recordings being transmitted, the featured artists, composers or songwriters, or an advertisement to purchase the sound recording transmitted.\nId. The operative language in this portion of the report appears to be \"new service either in the same or new transmission medium by taking advantages of the capabilities of that medium....\" Id.\n\nLikewise, in 2006, the Register of Copyrights reached a decision in which it concluded the term \"preexisting subscription service\" is best understood as \"referring to the business entity identified as the [PSS],\" rather than the program offerings made on a subscription basis to the public. 71 Fed. Reg. at 64646. Although the Register's decision also relies upon principles of statutory construction not indulged here, the Register's principle reasoning remains in accordance with this opinion.\n\nIII.

This suit, brought under \u00a7 32 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1), alleges that defendants infringed plaintiff's rights in the registered mark VIRGIN by operating retail stores selling wireless telephones and related accessories and services under the trade name VIRGIN WIRELESS. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Sifton, J.) denied plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, based upon its finding that plaintiff's registration did not cover the retail sale of wireless telephones and related products, and that plaintiff failed to show a likelihood of consumer confusion.\n\n2\nWe find that the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits and was entitled to a preliminary injunction. We therefore reverse and remand with instructions to enter a preliminary injunction.1\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n3\nPlaintiff VEL, a corporation with its principal place of business in London, owns U.S. Registration No. 1,851,817 (\"the 817 Registration\"), filed on May 5, 1991, and registered on August 30, 1994, for the VIRGIN mark as applied to \"retail store services in the fields of ... computers and electronic apparatus\" (emphasis added). Plaintiff filed an affidavit of continuing use, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1058(a), on April 27, 2000, which averred that plaintiff had used the mark in connection with retail store services selling computers and electronic apparatus. Plaintiff also owns U.S. Registration No. 1,852,776 (\"the 776 Registration\"), filed on May 9, 1991, and registered on September 6, 1994, for a stylized version of the VIRGIN mark for use in connection with \"retail store services in the fields of ... computers and electronic apparatus,\" and U.S. Registration No. 1,863,353 (\"the 353 Registration\"), filed on May 19, 1992, and registered on November 15, 1994, for the VIRGIN MEGASTORE mark. It is undisputed that these three registrations have become incontestable pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1065.\n\n4\nVEL, either directly or through corporate affiliates, operates various businesses worldwide under the trade name VIRGIN, including an airline, large-scale record stores called Virgin Megastores, and an internet information service. Plaintiff or its affiliates also market a variety of goods branded with the VIRGIN name, including music recordings, computer games, books, and luggage. Three of plaintiff's megastores are located in the New York area. According to an affidavit submitted to the district court in support of plaintiff's application for preliminary injunction, Virgin Megastores sell a variety of electronic apparatus, including video game systems, portable CD players, disposable cameras, and DVD players. These stores advertise in a variety of media, including radio.\n\n5\nDefendants Simon Blitz and Daniel Gazal are the sole shareholders of defendants Cel-Net Communications, Inc. (\"Cel-Net\"); The Cellular Network Communications, Inc., doing business as CNCG (\"CNCG\"); and SD Telecommunications, Inc. (\"SD Telecom\"). Blitz and Gazal formed Cel-Net in 1993 to sell retail wireless telephones and services in the New York area. Later, they formed CNCG to sell wireless phones and services on the wholesale level. CNCG now sells wireless phones and services to more than 400 independent wireless retailers. In 1998, Cel-Net received permission from New York State regulators to resell telephone services within the state.\n\n6\nAround 1999, Andrew Kastein, a vice-president of CNCG, began to develop a Cel-Net brand of wireless telecommunications products. In early 1999, Cel-Net entered into negotiations with the Sprint PCS network to provide telecommunications services for resale by Cel-Net. In August 1999, Cel-Net retained the law firm Pennie & Edmonds to determine the availability of possible service marks for Cel-Net. Pennie & Edmonds associate Elizabeth Langston researched for Kastein a list of possible service marks; among the marks Cel-Net asked to have researched was VIRGIN. Defendants claim that Langston told Cel-Net officer Simon Corney that VIRGIN was available for use in the telecommunications field. Plaintiff disputed this, offering an affidavit from Langston that she informed defendants that she would not search the VIRGIN mark because her firm represented plaintiff.2\n\n7\nAccording to defendants, in December 1999, Cel-Net retained Corporate Solutions, LLC and its principals Nathan Erlich and Tahir Nawab as joint venture partners to help raise capital to launch Cel-Net's wireless telephone service. On December 2, 1999, Erlich and Nawab filed four intent-to-use applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") to register the marks VIRGIN WIRELESS, VIRGIN MOBILE, VIRGIN COMMUNICATIONS, and VIRGIN NET in the field of telecommunications services, class 38. On December 24, 1999, Corporate Solutions incorporated defendant Virgin Wireless, Inc. (\"VWI\") and licensed to VWI the right to use the marks VIRGIN WIRELESS and VIRGIN MOBILE. Meanwhile, one of plaintiff's affiliates had begun to offer wireless telecommunication services bearing the VIRGIN mark in the United Kingdom. A press release dated November 19, 1999, found on plaintiff's website, stated that its Virgin Mobile wireless services were operable in the United States.\n\n8\nOn June 23, 2000, defendant Blitz signed a lease under the name Virgin Wireless for a kiosk location in South Shore Mall in Long Island from which to re-sell AT & T wireless services, telephones, and accessories under the retail name Virgin Wireless. Defendants Cel-Net and VWI later expanded their telecommunications re-sale operations to include two retail stores and four additional retail kiosks in malls in the New York area and in Pennsylvania. All of these stores have been run by VWI under the trade name VIRGIN WIRELESS. VWI also has leases and bank accounts in its name, and has shown evidence of actual retail transactions and newspaper advertisements.\n\n9\nIn August 2000, plaintiff licensed Virgin Mobile USA, LLC, to use the VIRGIN mark for wireless telecommunications services in the United States. On August 10, 2000, plaintiff filed an intent-to-use application with the PTO for use of the VIRGIN mark in the United States on telecommunications services and mobile telephones. On October 11, 2001, the PTO suspended this mark's registration in international class 9, which covers wireless telephones, and class 38, which covers telecommunications services, because the VIRGIN mark was already reserved by a prior filing, presumably defendants'. On August 16, 2001, plaintiff filed another intent-to-use application for the mark VIRGIN MOBILE to brand telecommunications services. The PTO issued a non-final action letter for both of plaintiff's pending new registrations on October 31, 2001, which stated that defendant Corporation Solutions' pending applications for similar marks in the same class could give rise to \"a likelihood of confusion.\" The PTO suspended action on plaintiff's application pending the processing of Corporation Solutions' applications.\n\n10\nIn October 2001, plaintiff issued a press release announcing that it was offering wireless telecommunications services and mobile telephones in the United States.\n\n11\nPlaintiff became aware of Corporation Solutions' application for registration of the VIRGIN WIRELESS and VIRGIN MOBILE marks by May 2000. In October 2001 and December 2001, defendant VWI filed suits against plaintiff in the federal district courts in Arizona and Delaware, alleging that plaintiff was using VWI's mark. Plaintiff maintains (and the district court found) that it learned in January 2002 that VWI and Cel-Net were operating kiosks under the VIRGIN WIRELESS name and two days later filed the present suit seeking to enjoin defendants from selling mobile phones in VIRGIN-branded retail stores.\n\n12\nOn May 2, 2002, the district court considered plaintiff's application for a preliminary injunction. It found that no essential facts were in dispute, and therefore no evidentiary hearing was required. It was uncontested (and the district court accordingly found) that plaintiff sold \"electronic apparatus\" in its stores, including \"various video game systems, portable cassette tape, compact disc, mp3, and mini disc players, portable radios, and disposable cameras,\" but not including telephones or telephone service, and that the only products the defendants sold in their stores were wireless telephones, telephone accessories, and wireless telephone services.\n\n13\nNoting that a party seeking a preliminary injunction must show the probability of irreparable harm in the absence of relief, and either (1) likelihood of success on the merits or (2) serious questions going to the merits and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in its favor, the court found that plaintiff had failed to satisfy either standard. Arguing against plaintiff's likelihood of success, the court noted that plaintiff's registrations did not claim use of the VIRGIN mark \"in telecommunications services or in the associated retail sale of wireless telephones and accessories.\" While plaintiff's 817 and 776 Registrations covered the retail sale of \"computers and electronic apparatus,\" they did not extend to telecommunications services and wireless phones.\n\n14\nThe court noted that the defendants were the first to use the VIRGIN mark in telecommunications, and the first to attempt to register VIRGIN for telecommunications and retail telephone sales. The court also observed that the dissimilarity in appearance of plaintiff's and defendants' logos and the differences between plaintiff's huge Virgin Megastores and defendants' small retail outlets in malls diminished likelihood of consumer confusion. Finally, because the defendants had expended substantial resources in pursuing their trademark applications and in establishing their retail presence, the court found that plaintiff could not demonstrate that the balance of hardships tipped in its favor.\n\n15\nThe court denied the application for preliminary injunction. The crux of the court's decision lay in the facts that plaintiff's prior use and registration of the VIRGIN mark in connection with the sale of consumer electronic equipment did not include the sale of telephones or telephone services, and that defendants were the first to register and use VIRGIN for telephones and wireless telephone service. This appeal followed.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nI.\n\n16\nAs the court below correctly noted, in order to obtain a preliminary injunction, a party must demonstrate probability of irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief, and either a likelihood that it will succeed on the merits of its claim, or a serious question going to the merits and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in its favor. See Jackson Dairy, Inc. v. H.P. Hood & Sons, Inc., 596 F.2d 70, 72 (2d Cir.1979) (per curiam); Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. McNeil-P.P.C., Inc., 973 F.2d 1033, 1038 (2d Cir.1992). We review the court's denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. Bristol-Myers, 973 F.2d at 1038.\n\n17\nIn an action for trademark infringement, where a mark merits protection, a showing that a significant number of consumers are likely to be confused about the source of the goods identified by the allegedly infringing mark is generally sufficient to demonstrate both irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits. Bristol-Myers, 973 F.2d at 1038; W. Publ'g Co. v. Rose Art Indus., Inc., 910 F.2d 57, 59 (2d Cir.1990). Thus, our inquiry must be whether the district court correctly determined that the plaintiff was not entitled to protection from use of its mark by others in the sale of wireless telephones and related services, and that there was no likelihood that, in the absence of a preliminary injunction, a significant number of consumers would be confused about the sponsorship of defendants' retail stores. For the reasons discussed below, we find that the mark is entitled to protection, and there is a significant likelihood of confusion. We reverse and remand.\n\nII.\n\n18\nA claim of trademark infringement, whether brought under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1) (for infringement of a registered mark) or 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) (for infringement of rights in a mark acquired by use), is analyzed under the familiar two-prong test described in Gruner + Jahr USA Publ'g v. Meredith Corp., 991 F.2d 1072 (2d Cir.1993). See Time, Inc. v. Petersen Publ'g Co. L.L.C., 173 F.3d 113, 117 (2d Cir.1999) (noting that Gruner test is applicable to claims brought under \u00a7 1114(1) and \u00a7 1125(a)). The test looks first to whether the plaintiff's mark is entitled to protection, and second to whether defendant's use of the mark is likely to cause consumers confusion as to the origin or sponsorship of the defendant's goods. Gruner, 991 F.2d at 1074. Examining the question as the test dictates, we have no doubt that plaintiff was entitled to a preliminary injunction.\n\n19\nWe believe the district court accorded plaintiff too narrow a scope of protection for its famous, arbitrary, and distinctive mark. There could be no dispute that plaintiff prevailed as to the first prong of the test \u2014 prior use and ownership. For years, plaintiff had used the VIRGIN mark on huge, famous stores selling, in addition to music recordings, a variety of consumer electronic equipment. At the time the defendants began using VIRGIN, plaintiff owned rights in the mark. The focus of inquiry thus turns to the second prong of the test \u2014 whether defendants' use of VIRGIN as a mark for stores selling wireless telephone services and phones was likely to cause confusion. There can be little doubt that such confusion was likely.\n\n20\nThe landmark case of Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 287 F.2d 492 (2d Cir.1961) (Friendly, J.), outlined a series of nonexclusive factors likely to be pertinent in addressing the issue of likelihood of confusion, which are routinely followed in such cases. See, e.g., Streetwise Maps, Inc. v. Vandam, Inc., 159 F.3d 739, 743-46 (2d Cir.1998); Arrow Fastener Co. v. Stanley Works, 59 F.3d 384, 391-99 (2d Cir.1995); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Pegasus Petroleum Corp., 818 F.2d 254, 256-60 (2d Cir.1987).\n\n21\nSix of the Polaroid factors relate directly to the likelihood of consumer confusion. These are the strength of the plaintiff's mark; the similarity of defendants' mark to plaintiff's; the proximity of the products sold under defendants' mark to those sold under plaintiff's; where the products are different, the likelihood that plaintiff will bridge the gap by selling the products being sold by defendants; the existence of actual confusion among consumers; and the sophistication of consumers. Of these six, all but the last (which was found by the district court to be neutral) strongly favor the plaintiff. The remaining two Polaroid factors, defendants' good or bad faith and the quality of defendants' products, are more pertinent to issues other than likelihood of confusion, such as harm to plaintiff's reputation and choice of remedy. We conclude that the Polaroid factors powerfully support plaintiff's position.\n\n22\nStrength of the mark. The strength of a trademark encompasses two different concepts, both of which relate significantly to likelihood of consumer confusion. The first and most important is inherent strength, also called \"inherent distinctiveness.\" This inquiry distinguishes between, on the one hand, inherently distinctive marks \u2014 marks that are arbitrary or fanciful in relation to the products (or services) on which they are used \u2014 and, on the other hand, marks that are generic, descriptive or suggestive as to those goods. The former are the strong marks. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir.1976). The second sense of the concept of strength of a mark is \"acquired distinctiveness,\" i.e., fame, or the extent to which prominent use of the mark in commerce has resulted in a high degree of consumer recognition. See TCPIP Holding Co. v. Haar Communications Inc., 244 F.3d 88, 100 (2d Cir.2001) (describing these two concepts of strength); Streetwise Maps, 159 F.3d at 743.\n\n23\nConsidering first inherent distinctiveness, the law accords broad, muscular protection to marks that are arbitrary or fanciful in relation to the products on which they are used, and lesser protection, or no protection at all, to marks consisting of words that identify or describe the goods or their attributes. The reasons for the distinction arise from two aspects of market efficiency. The paramount objective of the trademark law is to avoid confusion in the marketplace. The purpose for which the trademark law accords merchants the exclusive right to the use of a name or symbol in their area or commerce is identification, so that the merchants can establish goodwill for their goods based on past satisfactory performance, and the consuming public can rely on a mark as a guarantee that the goods or services so marked come from the merchant who has been found to be satisfactory in the past. See Estee Lauder Inc. v. The Gap, Inc., 108 F.3d 1503, 1510 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition \u00a7 21 comment i (1995)); Power Test Petroleum Distribs., Inc. v. Calcu Gas, Inc., 754 F.2d 91, 97 (2d Cir.1985); McGregor-Doniger Inc. v. Drizzle Inc., 599 F.2d 1126, 1131 (2d Cir.1979). At the same time, efficiency and the public interest require that every merchant trading in a class of goods be permitted to refer to the goods by their name, and to make claims about their quality. Thus, a merchant who sells pencils under the trademark Pencil or Clear Mark, for example, and seeks to exclude other sellers of pencils from using those words in their trade, is seeking an advantage the trademark law does not intend to offer. To grant such exclusivity would deprive the consuming public of the useful market information it receives where every seller of pencils is free to call them pencils. Abercrombie, 537 F.2d at 9; CES Publ'g Corp. v. St. Regis Publ'ns, Inc., 531 F.2d 11, 13 (2d Cir.1975). The trademark right does not protect the exclusive right to an advertising message \u2014 only the exclusive right to an identifier, to protect against confusion in the marketplace. Thus, as a matter of policy, the trademark law accords broader protection to marks that serve exclusively as identifiers and lesser protection where a grant of exclusiveness would tend to diminish the access of others to the full range of discourse relating to their goods. See TCPIP, 244 F.3d at 100; Nabisco, Inc. v. PF Brands, Inc., 191 F.3d 208, 215 (2d Cir.1999); Otokoyama Co. Ltd. v. Wine of Japan Import, Inc., 175 F.3d 266, 270 (2d Cir.1999).\n\n24\nThe second aspect of efficiency that justifies according broader protection to marks that are inherently distinctive relates directly to the likelihood of confusion. If a mark is arbitrary or fanciful, and makes no reference to the nature of the goods it designates, consumers who see the mark on different objects offered in the marketplace will be likely to assume, because of the arbitrariness of the choice of mark, that they all come from the same source. For example, if consumers become familiar with a toothpaste sold under an unusual, arbitrary brand name, such as ZzaaqQ, and later see that same inherently distinctive brand name appearing on a different product, they are likely to assume, notwithstanding the product difference, that the second product comes from the same producer as the first. The more unusual, arbitrary, and fanciful a trade name, the more unlikely it is that two independent entities would have chosen it. In contrast, every seller of foods has an interest in calling its product \"delicious.\" Consumers who see the word delicious used on two or more different food products are less likely to draw the inference that they must all come from the same producer. Cf. Streetwise Maps, 159 F.3d at 744 (noting that several map producers use \"street\" in product names; thus plaintiff's mark using \"street\" was not particularly distinctive); W. Publ'g, 910 F.2d at 61 (noting numerous registrations of marks using word \"golden\"). In short, the more distinctive the mark, the greater the likelihood that the public, seeing it used a second time, will assume that the second use comes from the same source as the first. The goal of avoiding consumer confusion thus dictates that the inherently distinctive, arbitrary, or fanciful marks, i.e., strong marks, receive broader protection than weak marks, those that are descriptive or suggestive of the products on which they are used. See Abercrombie, 537 F.2d at 9-11; TCPIP, 244 F.3d at 100-01.\n\n25\nThe second sense of trademark strength, fame, or \"acquired distinctiveness,\" also bears on consumer confusion. See TCPIP, 244 F.3d at 100-01; Streetwise Maps, 159 F.3d at 744. If a mark has been long, prominently and notoriously used in commerce, there is a high likelihood that consumers will recognize it from its prior use. Widespread consumer recognition of a mark previously used in commerce increases the likelihood that consumers will assume it identifies the previously familiar user, and therefore increases the likelihood of consumer confusion if the new user is in fact not related to the first. See Nabisco, 191 F.3d at 216-17. A mark's fame also gives unscrupulous traders an incentive to seek to create consumer confusion by associating themselves in consumers' minds with a famous mark. The added likelihood of consumer confusion resulting from a second user's use of a famous mark gives reason for according such a famous mark a broader scope of protection, at least when it is also inherently distinctive. See McGregor, 599 F.2d at 1132 (noting that secondary meaning may further enlarge the scope of protection accorded to inherently distinctive marks).\n\n26\nPlaintiff's VIRGIN mark undoubtedly scored high on both concepts of strength. In relation to the sale of consumer electronic equipment, the VIRGIN mark is inherently distinctive, in that it is arbitrary and fanciful; the word \"virgin\" has no intrinsic relationship whatsoever to selling such equipment. Because there is no intrinsic reason for a merchant to use the word \"virgin\" in the sale of consumer electronic equipment, a consumer seeing VIRGIN used in two different stores selling such equipment will likely assume that the stores are related.\n\n27\nPlaintiff's VIRGIN mark was also famous. The mark had been employed with world-wide recognition as the mark of an airline and as the mark for megastores selling music recordings and consumer electronic equipment. The fame of the mark increased the likelihood that consumers seeing defendants' shops selling telephones under the mark VIRGIN would assume incorrectly that defendants' shops were a part of plaintiff's organization. See Lois Sportswear, U.S.A., Inc. v. Levi Strauss & Co., 799 F.2d 867, 873 (2d Cir.1986).\n\n28\nThere can be no doubt that plaintiff's VIRGIN mark, as used on consumer electronic equipment, is a strong mark, as the district court found. It is entitled as such to a broad scope of protection, precisely because the use of the mark by others in connection with stores selling reasonably closely related merchandise would inevitably have a high likelihood of causing consumer confusion.\n\n29\nSimilarity of marks. When the secondary user's mark is not identical but merely similar to the plaintiff's mark, it is important to assess the degree of similarity between them in assessing the likelihood that consumers will be confused. See McGregor, 599 F.2d at 1133. Plaintiff's and defendants' marks were not merely similar; they were identical to the extent that both consisted of the same word, \"virgin.\"\n\n30\nThe district court believed this factor did not favor plaintiff because it found some differences in appearance. Defendants' logo used a difference typeface and different colors from plaintiff's. While those are indeed differences, they are quite minor in relation to the fact that the name being used as a trademark was the same in each case.\n\n31\nAdvertisement and consumer experience of a mark do not necessarily transmit all of the mark's features. Plaintiff, for example, advertised its Virgin Megastores on the radio. A consumer who heard those advertisements and then saw the defendants' installation using the name VIRGIN would have no way of knowing that the two trademarks looked different. See Sports Auth., Inc. v. Prime Hospitality Corp., 89 F.3d 955, 962 (2d Cir.1996). A consumer who had visited one of plaintiff's Virgin Megastores and remembered the name would not necessarily remember the typeface and color of plaintiff's mark. The reputation of a mark also spreads by word of mouth among consumers. One consumer who hears from others about their experience with Virgin stores and then encounters defendants' Virgin store will have no way knowing of the differences in typeface. See Hills Bros. Coffee, Inc. v. Hills Supermarkets, Inc., 428 F.2d 379, 381 (2d Cir.1970) (per curiam).\n\n32\nIn view of the fact that defendants used the same name as plaintiff, we conclude the defendants' mark was sufficiently similar to plaintiff's to increase the likelihood of confusion. This factor favored the plaintiff as a matter of law. We conclude that the district court erred in concluding otherwise on the basis of comparatively trivial and often irrelevant differences.\n\n33\nProximity of the products and likelihood of bridging the gap. The next factor is the proximity of the products being sold by plaintiff and defendant under identical (or similar) marks. See Arrow Fastener, 59 F.3d at 396. This factor has an obvious bearing on the likelihood of confusion. When the two users of a mark are operating in completely different areas of commerce, consumers are less likely to assume that their similarly branded products come from the same source. In contrast, the closer the secondary user's goods are to those the consumer has seen marketed under the prior user's brand, the more likely that the consumer will mistakenly assume a common source. See Cadbury Beverages, Inc. v. Cott Corp., 73 F.3d 474, 480-81 (2d Cir.1996).\n\n34\nWhile plaintiff had not sold telephones or telephone service prior to defendant's registration evincing intent to sell those items, plaintiff had sold quite similar items of consumer electronic equipment. These included computer video game systems, portable cassette-tape players, compact disc players, MP3 players, mini-disc players, and disposable cameras. Like telephones, many of these are small consumer electronic gadgets making use of computerized audio communication. They are sold in the same channels of commerce. Consumers would have a high expectation of finding telephones, portable CD players, and computerized video game systems in the same stores. We think the proximity in commerce of telephones to CD players substantially advanced the risk that consumer confusion would occur when both were sold by different merchants under the same trade name, VIRGIN.\n\n35\nOur classic Polaroid test further protects a trademark owner by examining the likelihood that, even if the plaintiff's products were not so close to the defendants' when the defendant began to market them, there was already a likelihood that plaintiff would in the reasonably near future begin selling those products. See Cadbury Beverages, 73 F.3d at 482. VEL's claim of proximity was further strengthened in this regard because, as the district court expressly found, \"plans had been formulated [for VEL] to enter [the market for telecommunications products and services] shortly in the future.\" VEL had already begun marketing telephone service in England which would operate in the United States, and, as the district court found, had made plans to sell telephones and wireless telephone service under the VIRGIN name from its retail stores.\n\n36\nThe district court, nonetheless, found in favor of the defendants with respect to the proximity of products and services. We would ordinarily give considerable deference to a factual finding on this issue. Here, however, we cannot do so because it appears the district court applied the wrong test. The court did not assess the proximity of defendants' VIRGIN-branded retail stores selling telephone products to plaintiff's VIRGIN-branded retail stores selling other consumer electronic products. It simply concluded that, because defendants were selling exclusively telephone products and services, and plaintiff's electronic products did not include telephones or related services, the defendants must prevail as to the proximity factor.\n\n37\nThis represents a considerable misunderstanding of the Polaroid test. The famous list of factors of likely pertinence in assessing likelihood of confusion in Polaroid was specially designed for a case like this one, in which the secondary user is not in direct competition with the prior user, but is selling a somewhat different product or service. In Polaroid, the plaintiff sold optical and camera equipment, while the defendant sold electronic apparatus. The test the court discussed was expressly addressed to the problem \"how far a valid trademark shall be protected with respect to goods other than those to which its owner has applied it.\" 287 F.2d at 495 (emphasis added); see also Arrow Fastener, 59 F.3d at 396 (noting that products need not actually compete with each other). The very fact that the test includes the \"proximity\" between the defendant's products and the plaintiff's and the likelihood that the plaintiff will \"bridge the gap\" makes clear that the trademark owner does not lose, as the district court concluded, merely because it has not previously sold the precise good or service sold by the secondary user.\n\n38\nIn our view, had the district court employed the proper test of proximity, it could not have failed to find a high degree of proximity as between plaintiff VEL's prior sales of consumer electronic audio equipment and defendants' subsequent sales of telephones and telephone services, which proximity would certainly contribute to likelihood of consumer confusion. And plaintiff was all the more entitled to a finding in its favor in respect of these matters by virtue of the fact, which the district court did find, that at the time defendants began using the VIRGIN mark in the retail sale of telephones and telephone services, plaintiff already had plans to bridge the gap by expanding its sales of consumer electronic equipment to include sales of those very goods and services in the near future. Consumer confusion was more than likely; it was virtually inevitable.\n\n39\nActual confusion. It is self-evident that the existence of actual consumer confusion indicates a likelihood of consumer confusion. Nabisco, 191 F.3d at 228. We have therefore deemed evidence of actual confusion \"particularly relevant\" to the inquiry. Streetwise Maps, 159 F.3d at 745.\n\n40\nPlaintiff submitted to the district court an affidavit of a former employee of defendant Cel-Net, who worked at a mall kiosk branded as Virgin Wireless, which stated that individuals used to ask him if the kiosk was affiliated with plaintiff's VIRGIN stores. The district court correctly concluded that this evidence weighed in plaintiff's favor.\n\n41\nSophistication of consumers. The degree of sophistication of consumers can have an important bearing on likelihood of confusion. Where the purchasers of a products are highly trained professionals, they know the market and are less likely than untrained consumers to be misled or confused by the similarity of different marks. The district court recognized that \"[r]etail customers, such as the ones catered to by both the defendants and [plaintiff], are not expected to exercise the same degree of care as professional buyers, who are expected to have greater powers of discrimination.\" On the other hand, it observed that purchasers of cellular telephones and the service plans were likely to give greater care than self-service customers in a supermarket. Noting that neither side had submitted evidence on the sophistication of consumers, the court made no finding favoring either side. We agree that the sophistication factor is neutral in this case.\n\n42\nBad faith and the quality of the defendants' services or products. Two factors remain of the conventional Polaroid test: the existence of bad faith on the part of the secondary user and the quality of the secondary user's products or services. Polaroid, 287 F.2d at 495. Neither factor is of high relevance to the issue of likelihood of confusion. A finding that a party acted in bad faith can affect the court's choice of remedy or can tip the balance where questions are close. It does not bear directly on whether consumers are likely to be confused. See TCPIP, 244 F.3d at 102. The district court noted some evidence of bad faith on the defendants' part, but because the evidence on the issue was scant and equivocal, the court concluded that such a finding \"at this stage [would be] speculative.\" The court therefore found that this factor favored neither party.\n\n43\nThe issue of the quality of the secondary user's product goes more to the harm that confusion can cause the plaintiff's mark and reputation than to the likelihood of confusion. See Arrow Fastener, 59 F.3d at 398 (noting that first user's reputation may be harmed if secondary user's goods are of poor quality). In any event, the district court found this factor to be \"neutral\" with respect to likelihood of confusion.\n\n44\n* * * * * *\n\n45\nIn summary we conclude that of the six Polaroid factors that pertain directly to the likelihood of consumer confusion, all but one favor the plaintiff, and that one \u2014 sophistication of consumers \u2014 is neutral. The plaintiff is strongly favored by the strength of its mark, both inherent and acquired; the similarity of the marks; the proximity of the products and services; the likelihood that plaintiff would bridge the gap; and the existence of actual confusion. None of the factors favors the defendant. The remaining factors were found to be neutral. Although we do not suggest that likelihood of confusion may be properly determined simply by the number of factors in one party's favor, the overall assessment in this case in our view admits only of a finding in plaintiff's favor that defendants' sale of telephones and telephone-related services under the VIRGIN mark was likely to cause substantial consumer confusion.\n\n46\nOne issue remains. Defendants argue that plaintiff should be barred by laches from seeking injunctive relief. They contend that because of plaintiff's delay after learning of the defendants' applications to register the VIRGIN marks, they expended considerable sums and developed goodwill in their use of the VIRGIN marks before plaintiff brought suit. Because the district court ruled in the defendants' favor it made no express finding on the issue of laches. But the district court explicitly found that plaintiff first learned of defendants' use of the name VIRGIN in commerce only two days before plaintiff instituted this suit. Given that finding, plaintiff could not be chargeable with laches.\n\n47\nWe conclude that, as a matter of law, plaintiff demonstrated irreparable harm and likelihood of success on the merits and was entitled to a preliminary injunction.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n48\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\n\nNotes:\n\n1\nImmediately following oral argument, we issued a summary order, opinion to follow, directing the district court to enter a preliminary injunction\n\n2\nBecause of Pennie & Edmonds's involvement in searching marks for defendants, and because of the factual dispute about whether plaintiff's counsel searched the VIRGIN mark for defendants, defendants sought in the district court to have Pennie & Edmonds disqualified from representing plaintiff.

CANBY, JR., CONSUELO M. CALLAHAN and SANDRA S. IKUTA, Circuit Judges.\n\nOPINION\n\nCANBY, Circuit Judge:\n\nUMG Recordings appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Troy Augusto on UMG's claim of copyright infringement in violation of \u00a7 501 of the Copyright Act, which entitles copyright owners to institute an action for infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies of the copyrighted work. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 501(a), (b), 106(3) (2006). The copies in issue comprise eight specially-produced compact discs, each embodying a copyrighted sound recording. UMG, the copyright owner, used the discs solely for marketing purposes, sending them unsolicited to individuals such as music critics and radio disc jockeys. Although Augusto was not one of those individuals, he managed to obtained the discs from various sources. He later sold them at auction, an act which UMG contends infringed its exclusive right to distribute the discs.\n\nAugusto asserts that UMG's initial distribution of the discs effected a transfer of ownership of the discs to the recipients, rendering the discs subject to the \"first sale\" doctrine, which permits one who has acquired ownership of a copy to dispose of that copy without the permission of the copyright owner. See id. \u00a7 109(a). UMG argues that the statements on the discs and the circumstances of their distribution granted only a license to each recipient, not a transfer of ownership (or \"sale\") of the copy. Absent a sale, UMG remained the owner of the discs and, accordingly, the defense of the first sale doctrine would be out of Augusto's reach. We conclude that the mailing indeed did effect a sale of the discs to the recipients for purposes of the first sale doctrine, and we affirm the order of the district court.\n\nBACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nThe material facts of the case are undisputed. UMG is among the world's largest music companies. One of its core businesses is the creation, manufacture, and sale of recorded music, or phonorecords, the copyrights of which are owned by UMG.[bookmark: r[1]][1] These phonorecords generally take the form of compact discs (\"CDs\").\n\nLike many music companies, UMG ships specially-produced promotional CDs to a large group of individuals (\"recipients\"), such as music critics and radio programmers, that it has selected. There is no prior agreement or request by the recipients to receive the CDs. UMG does not seek or receive payment for the CDs, the content and design of which often differs from that of their commercial counterparts. UMG ships the promotional CDs by means of the United States Postal Service and United Parcel Service. Relatively few of the recipients refuse delivery of the CDs or return them to UMG, and UMG destroys those that are returned.\n\nMost of the promotional CDs in issue in this case bore a statement (the \"promotional statement\") similar to the following:\n\nThis CD is the property of the record company and is licensed to the intended recipient for personal use only. Acceptance of this CD shall constitute an 1178*1178 agreement to comply with the terms of the license. Resale or transfer of possession is not allowed and may be punishable under federal and state laws.\n\nSome of the CDs bore a more succinct statement, such as \"Promotional Use Only \u2014 Not for Sale.\"[bookmark: r[2]][2]\n\nAugusto was not among the select group of individuals slated to receive the promotional CDs. He nevertheless managed to acquire numerous such CDs, many of which he sold through online auctions at eBay.com. Augusto regularly advertised the CDs as \"rare ... industry editions\" and referred to them as \"Promo CDs.\"\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts at halting the auctions through eBay's dispute resolution program, UMG filed a complaint against Augusto in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that Augusto had infringed UMG's copyrights in eight promotional CDs for which it retained the \"exclusive right to distribute.\" The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Augusto, and UMG appealed. We have jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nWe review de novo a grant of summary judgment. See Bagdadi v. Nazar, 84 F.3d 1194, 1197 (9th Cir.1996). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. See Video Software Dealers Ass'n v. Schwarzenegger, 556 F.3d 950, 956 (9th Cir.2009).\n\nWhile it is an open question as to whether the plaintiff or defendant bears the burden of proving the applicability of the first sale defense, see United States v. Wise, 550 F.2d 1180, 1191-92 (9th Cir. 1977) (government bears the burden of proof in the criminal context), we need not reach the issue in this case, because we would reach the same conclusion regardless of which party were to bear the burden.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTo establish a prima facie case of copyright infringement, a plaintiff must show (1) ownership of a valid copyright and (2) violation by the alleged infringer of at least one of the exclusive rights granted to copyright owners by the Copyright Act (the \"Act\"). See Ellison v. Robertson, 357 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir.2004) (citing 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(a)). Section 106 of the Act grants copyright owners, such as UMG, the exclusive right, among others, \"to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(3); see id. \u00a7 501(a) (\"Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by section[] 106 ... is an infringer of the copyright....\"). The district court held that UMG made out a prima facie case of copyright infringement: UMG established that it owned the copyright to the promotional CDs and Augusto sold the CDs without UMG's permission.\n\nAlthough UMG, as the owner of the copyright, has exclusive rights in the promotional CDs, \"[e]xemptions, compulsory licenses, and defenses found in the Copyright 1179*1179 Act narrow [those] rights.\" Wall Data Inc. v. Los Angeles Cnty. Sheriff's Dept., 447 F.3d 769, 777 (9th Cir.2006) (citing 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 107-22). Augusto invokes the \"first sale\" doctrine embodied in \u00a7 109(a) of the Act. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(a). He argues that the circumstances attending UMG's distribution of the discs effected a \"sale\" (transfer of ownership) of the discs to the original recipients and that, under the \"first sale\" doctrine, the recipients and subsequent owners of those particular copies were permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of those copies without authorization by the copyright holder.\n\nIn the alternative, Augusto argues that the original recipients were entitled to treat the CDs as gifts under the Unordered Merchandise Statute, enacted as part of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, and therefore had \"the right to retain, use, discard, or dispose of [them] in any manner [they saw] fit,\" in this case, by selling those CDs to the thrift shops and second-hand stores where Augusto states he purchased them. See 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3009(a), (b) (2006); see also Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-375, 84 Stat. 719 (codified at 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 101).\n\nUMG, on the other hand, contends that the promotional statement effected a license with the recipients and, because the recipients were not owners but licensees of the CDs, neither they nor Augusto were entitled to sell or otherwise transfer the CDs. See Quality King Distribs., Inc. v. L'anza Research Int'l, Inc., 523 U.S. 135, 146-47, 118 S.Ct. 1125, 140 L.Ed.2d 254 (1998) (\"[B]ecause the protection afforded by \u00a7 109(a) is available only to the `owner' of a lawfully made copy ..., the first sale doctrine would not provide a defense to... any nonowner such as a bailee, a licensee, a consignee, or one whose possession of the copy was unlawful.\"); Am. Int'l Pictures, Inc. v. Foreman, 576 F.2d 661, 664 (5th Cir.1978) (\"[U]nless title to the copy passes through a first sale by the copyright holder, subsequent sales do not confer good title.\").\n\nThe Distribution of the Promotional CDs Effected a Sale\n\nThe first sale doctrine provides that \"the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under [the Act], or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(a). Notwithstanding its distinctive name, the doctrine applies not only when a copy is first sold, but when a copy is given away or title is otherwise transferred without the accouterments of a sale. See 4 Patry on Copyright \u00a7 13:15; see also United States v. Atherton, 561 F.2d 747, 750 (9th Cir.1977) (\"The `sale' embodied in the first sale concept is a term of art.\"). \"[O]nce the copyright owner places a copyrighted item in the stream of commerce ..., he has exhausted his exclusive statutory right to control its distribution.\" Quality King, 523 U.S. at 152, 118 S.Ct. 1125. The seminal illustration of the principle is found in Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U.S. 339, 341, 28 S.Ct. 722, 52 L.Ed. 1086 (1908), where a copyright owner unsuccessfully attempted to restrain the resale of a copyrighted book by including in it the following notice: \"The price of this book at retail is $1 net. No dealer is licensed to sell it at a less price, and a sale at less price will be treated as an infringement of the copyright.\" Id. The Court noted that the statutory grant to a copyright owner of the \"sole right of vending\" the work did not continue after the first sale of a given copy. Id. at 349-50, 28 S.Ct. 722. \"The purchaser of a book, once sold by authority of the owner of the copyright, may sell it again, although he could not publish a new edition of it.\" Id. at 350, 28 S.Ct. 722. 1180*1180 The attempt to limit resale below a certain price was therefore held invalid. Id. at 351, 28 S.Ct. 722.\n\nThe rule of Bobbs-Merrill remains in full force, enshrined as it is in \u00a7 109(a) of the Act: a copyright owner who transfers title in a particular copy to a purchaser or donee cannot prevent resale of that particular copy. We have recognized, however, that not every transfer of possession of a copy transfers title. Particularly with regard to computer software, we have recognized that copyright owners may create licensing arrangements so that users acquire only a license to use the particular copy of software and do not acquire title that permits further transfer or sale of that copy without the permission of the copyright owner. Our most recent example of that rule is Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., 621 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir.2010). Others are Wall Data Inc. v. Los Angeles Cnty. Sheriff's Dept., 447 F.3d 769 (9th Cir.2006); Triad Sys. Corp. v. Se. Express Co., 64 F.3d 1330 (9th Cir.1995); MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir.1993). All of these cases dealt with the question whether arrangements with consumers amounted to sales of copies, or succeeded in awarding only licenses. They recognized that the mere labeling of an arrangement as a license rather than a sale, although it was a factor to be considered, was not by itself dispositive of the issue. See, e.g., Vernor, 621 F.3d at 1109 (construing United States v. Wise, 550 F.2d 1180, 1190-92 (9th Cir.1977)).\n\nThe same question is presented here. Did UMG succeed in creating a license in recipients of its promotional CDs, or did it convey title despite the restrictive labeling on the CDs? We conclude that, under all the circumstances of the CDs' distribution, the recipients were entitled to use or dispose of them in any manner they saw fit, and UMG did not enter a license agreement for the CDs with the recipients. Accordingly, UMG transferred title to the particular copies of its promotional CDs and cannot maintain an infringement action against Augusto for his subsequent sale of those copies.\n\nOur conclusion that the recipients acquired ownership of the CDs is based largely on the nature of UMG's distribution. First, the promotional CDs are dispatched to the recipients without any prior arrangement as to those particular copies. The CDs are not numbered, and no attempt is made to keep track of where particular copies are or what use is made of them. As explained in greater detail below, although UMG places written restrictions in the labels of the CDs, it has not established that the restrictions on the CDs create a license agreement.[bookmark: r[3]][3]\n\nWe also hold that, because the CDs were unordered merchandise, the recipients were free to dispose of them as they saw fit under the Unordered Merchandise Statute, 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3009, which provides in pertinent part that,\n\n(a) [e]xcept for ... free samples clearly and conspicuously marked as such,... the mailing of unordered merchandise... constitutes an unfair method of competition and an unfair trade practice....\n\n(b) Any merchandise mailed in violation of subsection (a) of this section ... may be treated as a gift by the recipient, who shall have the right to retain, use, discard, or dispose of it in any manner he sees fit without 1181*1181 any obligation whatsoever to the sender....\n\nId. \u00a7 3009(a), (b) (emphasis added). The statute defines \"unordered merchandise\" as \"merchandise mailed without the prior expressed request or consent of the recipient\" but leaves \"merchandise\" itself undefined. Id. \u00a7 3009(d). Although the statute applies in terms to \"mailed\" merchandise, the Federal Trade Commission has applied its prohibitions to other types of shipment, as violations of \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45. See 43 Fed.Reg. 4113 (Jan. 31, 1978).\n\nAugusto attempts to invoke this statute directly in his defense, but the statute in terms confers rights only on recipients of unordered merchandise. Augusto does not contend that UMG shipped the promotional CDs to him, nor does he show that any of his sources in fact treated the CDs as gifts.[bookmark: r[4]][4] The significance of the Unordered Merchandise Statute is not that it applies to Augusto, but that it confers on the recipients the \"right to retain, use, discard, or dispose of [the CDs] in any manner that [they] see[] fit, without obligation to the sender,\" UMG. 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3009(b). This provision is utterly inconsistent with the terms of the license that UMG sought to impose on the recipients. Because the statute grants to the recipients the right to treat the CDs as their own, shipping the unordered CDs to the recipients rendered the recipients owners, not licensees, of the CDs for purposes of the first sale defense. This effect of the Unordered Merchandise Statute distinguishes this case from those involving computer software, where the software consumers clearly ordered and paid for the software licensed to them. See, e.g., Wall Data, 447 F.3d at 774.\n\nUMG contends that the Unordered Merchandise Statute clearly does not apply to its distribution of free promotional CDs, because the \"main purpose\" of the Statute \"was to `control the unconscionable practice of persons who ship unordered merchandise to consumers and then trick or bully them into paying for it.'\" Kipperman v. Acad. Life Ins. Co., 554 F.2d 377, 379 (9th Cir.1977) (quoting 116 Cong. Rec. 22,314 (June 30, 1970) (statement of Sen. Warren Magnuson)). Because UMG is not trying to extract payment from the recipients, it argues that the statute does not apply. But the terms of the statute do not require \"bullying\" for payment; it is enough that unordered merchandise is sent. The recipient is then free to treat it as a gift \"without any obligation whatsoever to the sender.\" 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3009(b). In sending its promotional CDs, UMG attempts to obligate the recipient to confine the use of the CDs to promotional purposes. It serves the purpose of the statute to permit a recipient who does not wish to be so obligated to treat the unordered CD as a gift. We also have no difficulty concluding that the CDs fall within the meaning of \"merchandise.\" UMG's attempt to prohibit their sale is an indication.[bookmark: r[5]][5]\n\nThere are additional reasons for concluding that UMG's distribution of the CDs did not involve a consensual licensing operation. Some of the statements on the CDs and UMG's purported method of securing 1182*1182 agreement to licenses militate against a conclusion that any licenses were created. The sparest promotional statement, \"Promotional Use Only \u2014 Not for Sale,\" does not even purport to create a license. But even the more detailed statement is flawed in the manner in which it purports to secure agreement from the recipient. The more detailed statement provides:\n\nThis CD is the property of the record company and is licensed to the intended recipient for personal use only. Acceptance of this CD shall constitute an agreement to comply with the terms of the license. Resale or transfer of possession is not allowed and may be punishable under federal and state laws.\n\nIt is one thing to say, as the statement does, that \"acceptance\" of the CD constitutes an agreement to a license and its restrictions, but it is quite another to maintain that \"acceptance\" may be assumed when the recipient makes no response at all. This record reflects no responses. Even when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to UMG, it does not show that any recipients agreed to enter into a license agreement with UMG when they received the CDs.[bookmark: r[6]][6]\n\nBecause the record here is devoid of any indication that the recipients agreed to a license, there is no evidence to support a conclusion that licenses were established under the terms of the promotional statement. Accordingly, we conclude that UMG's transfer of possession to the recipients, without meaningful control or even knowledge of the status of the CDs after shipment, accomplished a transfer of title.\n\nThe district court based its decision in favor of Augusto in part on somewhat different grounds from those we have adopted. The district court first held that the licensing language in the detailed promotional statement did not create a license because it lacked any provision for UMG to regain possession of the CDs. In this ruling, the district court relied upon our decision in United States v. Wise, 550 F.2d 1180 (9th Cir.1977). In Wise, we dealt with several contracts, each denominated as a license, by which motion picture studios conveyed films to various recipients.\n\nThe issue was whether any of these licenses actually constituted a sale for purposes of the first sale doctrine.[bookmark: r[7]][7] We held all but one of the conveyances to be licenses, pointing out that they were designated as licenses, reserved title in the studio, and 1183*1183 provided for return or destruction of the prints after use. See id. at 1191-92. We held one purported license to be a sale, however, because in addition to the payment of a \"cost\" price (which did not alone establish a sale), there was no provision for return of the print to the studio; permanent possession was granted to the recipient. See id.\n\nReturn of possession is not invariably required in a license, however. We have since read Wise and our software licensing cases\n\nto prescribe three considerations that we may use to determine whether a software user is a licensee, rather than an owner of a copy. First, we consider whether the copyright owner specifies that a user is granted a license. Second, we consider whether the copyright owner significantly restricts the user's ability to transfer the software. Finally, we consider whether the copyright owner imposes notable use restrictions.\n\nVernor, 621 F.3d at 1110-11 (footnote omitted).\n\nThis formulation, however, applies in terms to software users, and software users who order and pay to acquire copies are in a very different position from that held by the recipients of UMG's promotional CDs. As we have already explained, UMG has virtually no control over the unordered CDs it issues because of its means of distribution, and it has no assurance that any recipient has assented or will assent to the creation of any license or accept its limitations. UMG also does not require the ultimate return of the promotional CDs to its possession. Although the failure to require return of the CDs may not, by itself, conclusively establish a sale under our precedent, it is one more indication that UMG had no control over the promotional CDs once it dispatched them. UMG thus did not retain \"sufficient incidents of ownership\" over the promotional copies \"to be sensibly considered the owner of the cop[ies].\" Krause v. Titleserv, Inc., 402 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2005).\n\nBecause we conclude that UMG's method of distribution transferred the ownership of the copies to the recipients, we have no need to parse the remaining provisions in UMG's purported licensing statement; UMG dispatched the CDs in a manner that permitted their receipt and retention by the recipients without the recipients accepting the terms of the promotional statements. UMG's transfer of unlimited possession in the circumstances present here effected a gift or sale within the meaning of the first sale doctrine, as the district court held.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nUMG's distribution of the promotional CDs under the circumstances effected a sale (transfer of title) of the CDs to the recipients. Further sale of those copies was therefore permissible without UMG's authorization. The judgment of the district court dismissing UMG's copyright infringement action against Augusto is therefore\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n[bookmark: [1]][1]  The Copyright Act defines phonorecords as \"material objects in which sounds ... are fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from which the sounds can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (2006).\n\n[bookmark: [2]][2]  Despite the fact that the two types of statements bear little resemblance to each other, the parties unaccountably agree that both types have the same meaning (although they dispute what that meaning is). Insofar as the parties' agreement purports to establish that the two statements have the same legal consequences, it does not bind us. See Swift & Co. v. Hocking Valley Ry. Co., 243 U.S. 281, 289, 37 S.Ct. 287, 61 L.Ed. 722 (1917) (\"If the stipulation is to be treated as an agreement concerning the legal effect of admitted facts, it is obviously inoperative; since the court cannot be controlled by agreement of counsel on a subsidiary question of law.\").\n\n[bookmark: [3]][3]  A few of the CDs are returned, and then destroyed by UMG. Needless to say, they were not the subjects of Augusto's resales. For the CDs that are not returned, UMG does not know the recipients' responses to the distribution or to the conditions UMG attempts to impose.\n\n[bookmark: [4]][4]  We have recognized a private right of action arising under the Unordered Merchandise Statute, but it is a right of recipients. Kipperman v. Acad. Life Ins. Co., 554 F.2d 377, 380 (9th Cir.1977).\n\n[bookmark: [5]][5]  Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"merchandise\" as \"commodities or goods that are bought and sold in business: the wares of commerce.\" Id. at 1413. See also Sanford v. MemberWorks, Inc., 625 F.3d 550, 559 (9th Cir.2010) (\"`Merchandise' ... refers to movable articles of value that are bought and sold by merchants.\"). Augusto's many sales themselves evidence a market, authorized or not.\n\n[bookmark: [6]][6]  Although our result does not depend on the point, there is even doubt that a license contract could arise from the absence of response of the recipients. The general rule of contract law is that the \"mere receipt of an unsolicited offer does not impair the offeree's freedom of action or inaction or impose on him any duty to speak.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 69 cmts. a, c. \"Nothing in contract law [can] force the parties into a contractual arrangement when they do not intend to be bound.\" Raymond T. Nimmer & Jeff Dodd, Modern Licensing Law \u00a7 3:17 (2010).\n\nThe commentary on section 69 of the Restatement offers a pertinent illustration: \"A sends B a [book] with a letter, saying, `If you wish to buy this book send me $6.50 within one week after receipt hereof, otherwise notify me and I will forward postage for return.' B examines the book and without replying carefully lays it on a shelf to await A's messenger. There is no contract.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 69 cmt. e, illus. 8 (emphasis added). The Restatement does provide an exception to the rule that silence and inaction do not constitute assent when, \"because of prior dealings or otherwise, it is reasonable that the offeree should notify the offeror if he does not intend to accept.\" Id. \u00a7 69(1)(c). The record as it stands does not suggest that UMG could avail itself of this provision.\n\n[bookmark: [7]][7]  Wise concerned the first sale doctrine as codified in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 27 (1970), the predecessor to \u00a7 109(a).

Asserted copyright holder Bill Graham Archives, LLC (\"BGA\" or \"Appellant\") 607*607 appeals from a judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissing, on motion for summary judgment, its copyright infringement action against Dorling Kindersley Limited, Dorling Kindersley Publishing, Inc., and R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (collectively \"DK\" or \"Appellees\"). We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, and we agree with the court that DK's reproduction of BGA's images is protected by the fair use exception to copyright infringement.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn October of 2003, DK published Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip (\"Illustrated Trip\"), in collaboration with Grateful Dead Productions, intended as a cultural history of the Grateful Dead. The resulting 480-page coffee table book tells the story of the Grateful Dead along a timeline running continuously through the book, chronologically combining over 2000 images representing dates in the Grateful Dead's history with explanatory text. A typical page of the book features a collage of images, text, and graphic art designed to simultaneously capture the eye and inform the reader. Plaintiff BGA claims to own the copyright to seven images displayed in Illustrated Trip, which DK reproduced without BGA's permission.\n\nInitially, DK sought permission from BGA to reproduce the images. In May of 2003, the CEO of Grateful Dead Productions sent a letter to BGA seeking permission for DK to publish the images. BGA responded by offering permission in exchange for Grateful Dead Productions' grant of permission to BGA to make CDs and DVDs out of concert footage in BGA's archives. Next, DK directly contacted BGA seeking to negotiate a license agreement, but the parties disagreed as to an appropriate license fee. Nevertheless, DK proceeded with publication of Illustrated Trip without entering a license fee agreement with BGA. Specifically, DK reproduced seven artistic images originally depicted on Grateful Dead event posters and tickets.[bookmark: r[2]][1] BGA's seven images are displayed in significantly reduced form and are accompanied by captions describing the concerts they represent.\n\nWhen DK refused to meet BGA's post-publication license fee demands, BGA filed suit for copyright infringement. BGA sought to enjoin further publication of Illustrated Trip, the destruction of all unsold books, and actual and statutory damages. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment, with the primary issue before the district court being whether DK's use of BGA's images constituted fair use under the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq. (\"Copyright Act\"). After applying the statutory fair use balancing test, the district court determined that DK's reproduction of the images was fair use and granted DK's motion for summary judgment.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nSection 106 of the Copyright Act grants copyright holders a bundle of exclusive 608*608 rights, including the right to \"reproduce the copyrighted work in copies,\" and the right \"to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106. For purposes of the motion, the district court assumed plaintiff possessed these rights in the contested images and there is no dispute that copying the images was not authorized by plaintiff. The issue before us on appeal, as it was in the district court, is whether DK's unauthorized use of BGA's copyrighted images is fair use.\n\nThe fair use doctrine is a statutory exception to copyright infringement. Section 107 of the Copyright Act permits the unauthorized use or reproduction of copyrighted work if it is \"for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching . . ., scholarship, or research.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. Whether such \"fair use\" exists involves a case-by-case determination using four non-exclusive, statutorily provided factors in light of the purposes of copyright. Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 549, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985). The factors are: (1) \"the purpose and character of the use;\" (2) \"the nature of the copyrighted work;\" (3) \"the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;\" and (4) \"the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. \"The ultimate test of fair use . . . is whether the copyright law's goal of promoting the Progress of Science and useful Arts would be better served by allowing the use than by preventing it.\" Castle Rock Entm't, Inc. v. Carol Publ'g Group, 150 F.3d 132, 141 (2d Cir.1998) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\nIn this case, the district court concluded that the balance of fair use factors weighs in favor of DK. Although the issue of fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, the court may resolve issues of fair use at the summary judgment stage where there are no genuine issues of material fact as to such issues. Wright v. Warner Books, Inc., 953 F.2d 731, 735 (2d Cir. 1991). As there are no genuine issues of material fact here, we review the district court's legal conclusions de novo. New Era Publ'ns Int'l, ApS v. Carol Publ'g Group, 904 F.2d 152, 155 (2d Cir.1990). We agree with the district court that DK's use of the copyrighted images is protected as fair use.\n\nI. Purpose and Character of Use\n\nWe first address \"the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(1).[bookmark: r[3]][2] Most important to the court's analysis of the first factor is the \"transformative\" nature of the work. See Pierre N. Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L.Rev. 1105, 1111 (1990). The question is \"whether the new work merely supersede[s] the objects of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character, altering the first with new expression, meaning, or message.\" Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).\n\nHere, the district court determined that Illustrated Trip is a biographical work, and the original images are not, and therefore accorded a strong presumption in favor 609*609 of DK's use. In particular, the district court concluded that DK's use of images placed in chronological order on a timeline is transformatively different from the mere expressive use of images on concert posters or tickets. Because the works are displayed to commemorate historic events, arranged in a creative fashion, and displayed in significantly reduced form, the district court held that the first fair use factor weighs heavily in favor of DK.\n\nAppellant challenges the district court's strong presumption in favor of fair use based on the biographical nature of Illustrated Trip. Appellant argues that based on this purported error the district court failed to examine DK's justification for its use of each of the images. Moreover, Appellant argues that as a matter of law merely placing poster images along a timeline is not a transformative use. Appellant asserts that each reproduced image should have been accompanied by comment or criticism related to the artistic nature of the image.\n\nWe disagree with Appellant's limited interpretation of transformative use and we agree with the district court that DK's actual use of each image is transformatively different from the original expressive purpose. Preliminarily, we recognize, as the district court did, that Illustrated Trip is a biographical work documenting the 30-year history of the Grateful Dead. While there are no categories of presumptively fair use, see Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. at 584, 114 S.Ct. 1164, courts have frequently afforded fair use protection to the use of copyrighted material in biographies, recognizing such works as forms of historic scholarship, criticism, and comment that require incorporation of original source material for optimum treatment of their subjects. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107 (stating that fair use of a copyrighted work \"for purposes such as criticism, comment . . . [or] scholarship . . . is not an infringement of copyright\"); Am. Geophysical Union v. Texaco, Inc., 60 F.3d 913, 932 (2d Cir.1994) (Jacobs, J., dissenting) (noting that \"[m]uch of our fair use case law has been generated by the use of quotation in biographies, a practice that fits comfortably within the[] statutory categories of uses illustrative of uses that can be fair\") (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original); Salinger v. Random House, Inc., 811 F.2d 90, 96 (2d Cir.1987) (holding that quotation of Salinger's letters in a biography could be considered criticism, scholarship, and research, which are among the illustrative statutory categories of fair use enumerated in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107). No less a recognition of biographical value is warranted in this case simply because the subject made a mark in pop culture rather than some other area of human endeavor. See Twin Peaks Prods., Inc. v. Publ'ns Int'l, Ltd., 996 F.2d 1366, 1374 (2d Cir.1993) (noting that a work that comments about \"pop culture\" is not removed from the scope of Section 107 simply because it is not erudite).\n\nIn the instant case, DK's purpose in using the copyrighted images at issue in its biography of the Grateful Dead is plainly different from the original purpose for which they were created. Originally, each of BGA's images fulfilled the dual purposes of artistic expression and promotion. The posters were apparently widely distributed to generate public interest in the Grateful Dead and to convey information to a large number people about the band's forthcoming concerts. In contrast, DK used each of BGA's images as historical artifacts to document and represent the actual occurrence of Grateful Dead concert events featured on Illustrated Trip's timeline.\n\nIn some instances, it is readily apparent that DK's image display enhances the 610*610 reader's understanding of the biographical text.[bookmark: r[4]][3] In other instances, the link between image and text is less obvious; nevertheless, the images still serve as historical artifacts graphically representing the fact of significant Grateful Dead concert events selected by the Illustrated Trip's author for inclusion in the book's timeline.[bookmark: r[5]][4] We conclude that both types of uses fulfill DK's transformative purpose of enhancing the biographical information in Illustrated Trip, a purpose separate and distinct from the original artistic and promotional purpose for which the images were created. See Elvis Presley Enters., Inc. v. Passport Video, 349 F.3d 622, 628-29 (9th Cir.2003) (finding the use of television clips to be transformative where \"the clips play for only a few seconds and are used for reference purposes while a narrator talks over them or interviewees explain their context in Elvis' career,\" but not to be transformative where the clips \"play without much interruption, [and t]he purpose of showing these clips likely goes beyond merely making a reference for a biography, but instead serves the same intrinsic entertainment value that is protected by Plaintiffs' copyrights\"); see also Hofheinz v. A & E Television Networks, Inc., 146 F.Supp.2d 442, 446-47 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (ruling that unauthorized inclusion of copyrighted film clips in actor's biographical film was protected fair use because the biography \"was not shown to recreate the creative expression reposing in plaintiff's [copyrighted] film, [but] for the transformative purpose 611*611 of enabling the viewer to understand the actor's modest beginnings in the film business\"). In sum, because DK's use of the disputed images is transformative both when accompanied by referencing commentary and when standing alone, we agree with the district court that DK was not required to discuss the artistic merits of the images to satisfy this first factor of fair use analysis.\n\nThis conclusion is strengthened by the manner in which DK displayed the images. First, DK significantly reduced the size of the reproductions. See Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp., 336 F.3d 811, 818-20 (9th Cir. 2003) (finding online search engine's use of thumbnail-sized images to be highly transformative). While the small size is sufficient to permit readers to recognize the historical significance of the posters, it is inadequate to offer more than a glimpse of their expressive value. In short, DK used the minimal image size necessary to accomplish its transformative purpose.\n\nSecond, DK minimized the expressive value of the reproduced images by combining them with a prominent timeline, textual material, and original graphical artwork, to create a collage of text and images on each page of the book. To further this collage effect, the images are displayed at angles and the original graphical artwork is designed to blend with the images and text. Overall, DK's layout ensures that the images at issue are employed only to enrich the presentation of the cultural history of the Grateful Dead, not to exploit copyrighted artwork for commercial gain. See Hofheinz, 146 F.Supp. at 446.\n\nThird, BGA's images constitute an inconsequential portion of Illustrated Trip. The extent to which unlicensed material is used in the challenged work can be a factor in determining whether a biographer's use of original materials has been sufficiently transformative to constitute fair use. See Craft v. Kobler, 667 F.Supp. 120, 129 (S.D.N.Y.1987) (Leval, J.) (finding biography of Stravinsky to be unfair in part because the takings were numerous and were the \"liveliest and most entertaining part of the biography\"). Although our circuit has counseled against considering the percentage the allegedly infringing work comprises of the copyrighted work in conducting third-factor fair use analysis, see NXIVM Corp. v. Ross Inst., 364 F.3d 471, 480 (2d Cir.2004), several courts have done so, see, e.g., Harper, 471 U.S. at 565-66, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (finding the fact that quotes from President Ford's unpublished memoirs played a central role in the allegedly infringing magazine article, constituting 13% of that article, weighed against a finding of fair use); Salinger, 811 F.2d at 98-99 (finding the fact that letters are quoted or paraphrased on approximately 40% of the book's 192 pages weighs against fair use). We find this inquiry more relevant in the context of first-factor fair use analysis.\n\nIn the instant case, the book is 480 pages long, while the BGA images appear on only seven pages. Although the original posters range in size from 13\" x 19\" to more than 19\" x 27,\" the largest reproduction of a BGA image in Illustrated Trip is less than 3\" x 4\u00bd,\" less than 1/20 the size of the original. And no BGA image takes up more than one-eighth of a page in a book or is given more prominence than any other image on the page. In total, the images account for less than one-fifth of one percent of the book. This stands in stark contrast to the wholesale takings in cases such as those described above, and we are aware of no case where such an insignificant taking was found to be an unfair use of original materials.\n\nFinally, as to this first factor, we briefly address the commercial nature of Illustrated Trip. See Harper, 471 U.S. at 612*612 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218 (stating that the fact that the purpose of a new use is commercial weighs against finding fair use). Even though Illustrated Trip is a commercial venture, we recognize that \"nearly all of the illustrative uses listed in the preamble paragraph of \u00a7 107 . . . are generally conducted for profit. . . .\" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 584, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, \"[t]he crux of the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price.\" Harper, 471 U.S. at 562, 105 S.Ct. 2218. Here, Illustrated Trip does not exploit the use of BGA's images as such for commercial gain. Significantly, DK has not used any of BGA's images in its commercial advertising or in any other way to promote the sale of the book. Illustrated Trip merely uses pictures and text to describe the life of the Grateful Dead. By design, the use of BGA's images is incidental to the commercial biographical value of the book.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the first fair use factor weighs in favor of DK because DK's use of BGA's images is transformatively different from the images' original expressive purpose and DK does not seek to exploit the images' expressive value for commercial gain.\n\nII. Nature of the Copyrighted Work\n\nThe second factor in a fair use determination is \"the nature of the copyrighted work.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(2). To resolve this inquiry the court considers \"the protection of the reasonable expectations of one who engages in the kinds of creation/authorship that the copyright seeks to encourage.\" Leval, supra, at 1122. \"[C]reative expression for public dissemination falls within the core of the copyright's protective purposes.\" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164.\n\nThe district court determined that the second factor weighs against DK because the images are creative artworks, which are traditionally the core of intended copyright protection. Nevertheless, the court limited the weight it placed on this factor because the posters have been published extensively. Appellant agrees that the district court properly weighed the second factor against DK, although it questions the lesser protection given to published works. Appellees counter that because the images are mixed factual and creative works and have been long and extensively published, the second factor tilts toward fair use.\n\nWe agree with the district court that the creative nature of artistic images typically weighs in favor of the copyright holder. We recognize, however, that the second factor may be of limited usefulness where the creative work of art is being used for a transformative purpose. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (stating that the second factor is not \"likely to help much in separating the fair use sheep from the infringing goats\" in cases involving transformative copying of \"publicly known, expressive works\"). This is not a case such as Ringgold v. Black Entm't Television, Inc., 126 F.3d 70 (2d Cir.1997), in which we held that the creative work was being used for the same decorative purpose as the original. Here, we conclude that DK is using BGA's images for the transformative purpose of enhancing the biographical information provided in Illustrated Trip. Accordingly, we hold that even though BGA's images are creative works, which are a core concern of copyright protection, the second factor has limited weight in our analysis because the purpose of DK's use was to emphasize the 613*613 images' historical rather than creative value.\n\nIII. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used\n\nThe third fair use factor asks the court to examine \"the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(3). We review this factor with reference to the copyrighted work, not the infringing work. New Era, 904 F.2d at 159. The court must examine the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the portion of the copyrighted material taken. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164.\n\nThe district court determined that even though the images are reproduced in their entirety, the third fair use factor weighs in favor of DK because the images are displayed in reduced size and scattered among many other images and texts. In faulting this conclusion, Appellant contends that the amount used is substantial because the images are copied in their entirety. Neither our court nor any of our sister circuits has ever ruled that the copying of an entire work favors fair use. At the same time, however, courts have concluded that such copying does not necessarily weigh against fair use because copying the entirety of a work is sometimes necessary to make a fair use of the image. See Kelly, 336 F.3d at 821 (concluding that images used for a search engine database are necessarily copied in their entirety for the purpose of recognition); Nunez v. Caribbean Int'l News Corp., 235 F.3d 18, 24 (1st Cir.2000) (concluding that to copy any less than the entire image would have made the picture useless to the story). Adopting this reasoning, we conclude that the third-factor inquiry must take into account that the \"the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the use.\" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586-87, 114 S.Ct. 1164.\n\nHere, DK used BGA's images because the posters and tickets were historical artifacts that could document Grateful Dead concert events and provide a visual context for the accompanying text. To accomplish this use, DK displayed reduced versions of the original images and intermingled these visuals with text and original graphic art. As a consequence, even though the copyrighted images are copied in their entirety, the visual impact of their artistic expression is significantly limited because of their reduced size. See Kelly, 336 F.3d at 821 (concluding that thumbnails are not a substitute for full-size images). We conclude that such use by DK is tailored to further its transformative purpose because DK's reduced size reproductions of BGA's images in their entirety displayed the minimal image size and quality necessary to ensure the reader's recognition of the images as historical artifacts of Grateful Dead concert events. Accordingly, the third fair use factor does not weigh against fair use.\n\nIV. Effect of the Use upon the Market for or Value of the Original\n\nThe fourth factor is \"the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(4). The court looks to not only the market harm caused by the particular infringement, but also to whether, if the challenged use becomes widespread, it will adversely affect the potential market for the copyrighted work. Harper, 471 U.S. at 568, 105 S.Ct. 2218. This analysis requires a balancing of \"the benefit the public will derive if the use is permitted and the personal gain the copyright owner will receive if the use is denied.\" MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, 677 F.2d 180, 183 (2d Cir.1981).\n\n614*614 In the instant case, the parties agree that DK's use of the images did not impact BGA's primary market for the sale of the poster images. Instead, we look to whether DK's unauthorized use usurps BGA's potential to develop a derivative market. Appellant argues that DK interfered with the market for licensing its images for use in books. Appellant contends that there is an established market for licensing its images and it suffered both the loss of royalty revenue directly from DK and the opportunity to obtain royalties from others.\n\n\"It is indisputable that, as a general matter, a copyright holder is entitled to demand a royalty for licensing others to use its copyrighted work, and that the impact on potential licensing revenues is a proper subject for consideration in assessing the fourth factor.\" Texaco, 60 F.3d at 929 (citations omitted). We have noted, however, that \"were a court automatically to conclude in every case that potential licensing revenues were impermissibly impaired simply because the secondary user did not pay a fee for the right to engage in the use, the fourth fair use factor would always favor the copyright holder.\" Id. at 930 n. 17 (emphasis added); see Princeton Univ. Press v. Mich. Document Servs., 99 F.3d 1381, 1387 (6th Cir.1996) (stating that a copyright holder must have a right to copyright revenues before finding that a failure to pay a license fee equals market harm); Leval, supra, at 1124 (stating that \"[b]y definition every fair use involves some loss of royalty revenue because the secondary user has not paid royalties\"); 4 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7 13.05[A][4] (2005) (stating that \"it is a given in every fair use case that plaintiff suffers a loss of a potential market if that potential is defined as the theoretical market for licensing the very use at bar\"). Accordingly, we do not find a harm to BGA's license market merely because DK did not pay a fee for BGA's copyrighted images.\n\nInstead, we look at the impact on potential licensing revenues for \"traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed markets.\" Texaco, 60 F.3d at 930. In order to establish a traditional license market, Appellant points to the fees paid to other copyright owners for the reproduction of their images in Illustrated Trip. Moreover, Appellant asserts that it established a market for licensing its images, and in this case expressed a willingness to license images to DK. Neither of these arguments shows impairment to a traditional, as opposed to a transformative market.[bookmark: r[6]][5] See Leval, supra, at 1125 (explaining that \"[t]he fourth factor disfavors a finding of fair use only when the market is impaired because the . . . material serves the consumer as a substitute, or, . . . supersedes the use of the original\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nHere, unlike in Texaco, we hold that DK's use of BGA's images is transformatively different from their original expressive purpose.[bookmark: r[7]][6] In a case such as this, a 615*615 copyright holder cannot prevent others from entering fair use markets merely \"by developing or licensing a market for parody, news reporting, educational or other transformative uses of its own creative work.\" Castle Rock, 150 F.3d at 146 n. 11. \"[C]opyright owners may not preempt exploitation of transformative markets. . . .\" Id. Moreover, a publisher's willingness to pay license fees for reproduction of images does not establish that the publisher may not, in the alternative, make fair use of those images. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 585 n. 18, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (stating that \"being denied permission to use [or pay license fees for] a work does not weigh against a finding of fair use\"). Since DK's use of BGA's images falls within a transformative market, BGA does not suffer market harm due to the loss of license fees.\n\nV. Balance of Factors\n\nOn balance, we conclude, as the district court did, that the fair use factors weigh in favor of DK's use. For the first factor, we conclude that DK's use of concert posters and tickets as historical artifacts of Grateful Dead performances is transformatively different from the original expressive purpose of BGA's copyrighted images. While the second factor favors BGA because of the creative nature of the images, its weight is limited because DK did not exploit the expressive value of the images. Although BGA's images are copied in their entirety, the third factor does not weigh against fair use because the reduced size of the images is consistent with the author's transformative purpose. Finally, we conclude that DK's use does not harm the market for BGA's sale of its copyrighted artwork, and we do not find market harm based on BGA's hypothetical loss of license revenue from DK's transformative market.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude that DK's use of BGA's copyrighted images in its book Illustrated Trip is fair use. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.\n\n[bookmark: [1]][*]  The Honorable Jane A. Restani, Chief Judge of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.\n\n[bookmark: [2]][1]  The disputed images appear as follows: (1) on page 76, a concert poster for the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Big Brother and the Holding Company playing at the Hollywood Bowl; (2) on page 103, a concert poster for the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Sons of Champlin playing at the Winterland Arena; (3) on page 130, a picture of the front and back of a concert ticket for a show at the Fillmore Theatre, reused for a Grateful Dead concert at the Winterland Arena; (4) on page 254, a concert poster for Grateful Dead shows at the Warfield Theatre; (5) on page 361, a concert poster for a Grateful Dead show at the Oakland Coliseum; (6) on page 397, a concert poster for a Grateful Dead show on New Year's Eve; and (7) on page 421, a fake in-house poster for a New Year's Eve 1993 concert.\n\n[bookmark: [3]][2]  Obviously, the use here is of a general commercial nature rather than a non-profit nature, but the inquiry is both a broader one and a narrower one than may appear at first glance as will be explained.\n\n[bookmark: [4]][3]  For example, BGA claims copyright infringement of a concert poster image, reproduced on page 254 of Illustrated Trip, depicting two skeletons flanking the Warfield Theatre. The reader is expected to view this image together with the text on pages 254 and 255 under the caption, \"The Warfield/Radio City Shows,\" and with a non-contested image on page 255, depicting two skeletons flanking the Radio City Music Hall. In this instance, the text specifically comments on the poster image, explaining:\n\nThe Dead's real 15th anniversary celebration in 1980 spanned two months, two coasts, and eventually two albums. . . . The bicoastal settings for the shows were very different\u2014San Francisco's Warfield Theatre was an intimate house of 2,400 seats, while New York City's Radio City Music Hall was, well, Radio City\u2014but the Dead's performances in both produced some of the most treasured moments of the band's early '80s period. . . . The [Dead's] otherwise brilliant Radio City run was marred by a bizarre dispute between the band and Radio City's management. The latter objected to promotional posters showing the inevitable skeletons flanking the venerable venue. Evidently not well versed in Grateful Dead iconography, the Radio City execs interpreted the posters as a coded message that the band thought that Radio City's days were numbered, and they slapped the band with a million-dollar lawsuit. The misunderstanding was quickly cleared up.\n\nThe author uses images to enhance the reader's understanding of the statement that Radio City Music Hall executives were unfamiliar with Grateful Dead iconography by displaying nearly identical concert promotion posters for the Warfield Theatre and the Radio City Music Hall.\n\n[bookmark: [5]][4]  For example, BGA claims copyright infringement of a concert poster image, reproduced on page 103 of Illustrated Trip, promoting a concert at the Winterland Arena. The reader is expected to view this image together with an entry on the timeline for October 24, 25, and 26, accompanying text describing the shows, and a quotation from Bill Graham to the audience on Saturday, October 25. The text describes the show as follows:\n\nHot Tuna, Jefferson Airplane, and Sons of Champlin play all three nights. On Saturday Stephen Stills may have played on \"Turn on Your Lovelight.\" Sunday marks the last \"Doin' that Rag.\"\n\nWhile the concert poster image does not necessarily enhance the reader's understanding of the text, it serves as a recognizable representation of the concert. It also documents concert information and provides notable historic details, such as the fact that, at this relatively early stage of its career, the Grateful Dead received second billing to Jefferson Airplane.\n\n[bookmark: [6]][5]  To the contrary, had the book been commercially successful\u2014which it was not\u2014it might have garnered interest in the original images in full size because the reduced images have such minimal expressive impact. An afficionado might seek more than a \"peek.\"\n\n[bookmark: [7]][6]  Texaco may also be distinguished because in that case we found that scientific researchers' copying of scientific journal articles caused those journals to lose license revenues, because the researchers were looking to their own copies of the articles rather than downloading them from online databases such as Lexis, which paid the journals a license fee. See 60 F.3d at 929-32. In other words, Texaco involved direct evidence that the allegedly infringing use would cause the owner to lose license revenues derived from a substantially similar use.\n\nHere, in contrast, BGA's direct evidence of its license revenues involves a use that is markedly different from the use by DK. The licenses BGA sold to other publishers were for substantially less transformative uses of its posters: full-page, prominently displayed reproductions of BGA's images, with little discussion of the images or their historical context, much less any compilation of other related works into a coherent whole. Indeed, one of the images BGA points to was used as the cover of a book. DK's use of BGA's images is markedly more original than the other uses that BGA has licensed and BGA thus has not shown direct evidence of significant lost license revenue from the uses at issue

Omni Video Games, Inc., its distributor, and two of its officers appeal from an order entered May 22, 1981 in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Eugene H. Nickerson, Judge), preliminarily enjoining them from infringing the copyright of Stern Electronics, Inc. in the audiovisual work entitled \"Scramble\" and from making further use of the trademark \"SCRAMBLE\" in connection with electronic video games. 523 F.Supp. 635. Appellants contend that the visual images and accompanying sounds of the video game fail to satisfy the fixation and originality requirements of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 102(a) (1976), and that they, rather than appellees, have superior rights to the mark \"SCRAMBLE\". We reject these contentions and affirm the preliminary injunction.\n\n2\nVideo games like \"Scramble\" can roughly be described as computers programmed to create on a television screen cartoons in which some of the action is controlled by the player. In Stern's \"Scramble,\" for example, the video screen displays a spaceship moving horizontally through six different scenes in which obstacles are encountered. With each scene the player faces increasing difficulty in traversing the course and scoring points. The first scene depicts mountainous terrain, missile bases, and fuel depots. The player controls the altitude and speed of the spaceship, decides when to release the ship's supply of bombs, and fires lasers that can destroy attacking missiles and aircraft. He attempts to bomb the missile bases (scoring points for success), bomb the fuel depots (increasing his own diminishing fuel supply with each hit), avoid the missiles being fired from the ground, and avoid crashing his ship into the mountains. And that is only scene one. In subsequent scenes the hazards include missile-firing enemy aircraft and tunnel-like airspaces. The scenes are in color, and the action is accompanied by battlefield sounds.\n\n3\nThe game is built into a cabinet containing a cathode ray tube, a number of electronic circuit boards, a loudspeaker, and hand controls for the player. The electronic circuitry includes memory storage devices called PROMs, an acronym for \"programmable read only memory.\"1 The PROM stores the instructions and data from a computer program in such a way that when electric current passes through the circuitry, the interaction of the program stored in the PROM with the other components of the game produces the sights and sounds of the audiovisual display that the player sees and hears. The memory devices determine not only the appearance and movement of the images but also the variations in movement in response to the player's operation of the hand controls.\n\n4\nStern manufactures amusement equipment, including video games, for distribution worldwide. In January 1981 at a London trade exhibit Stern became aware of \"Scramble,\" an electronic video game developed in late 1980 by a Japanese corporation, Konami Industry Co., Ltd. The audiovisual display constituting what Stern alleges is the copyrightable work was first published in Japan on January 8, 1981. Stern secured an exclusive sub-license to distribute the \"Scramble\" game in North and South America from Konami's exclusive licensee, and began selling the game in the United States on March 17, 1981. Even in the fast-paced world of video games, \"Scramble\" quickly became a big success. Approximately 10,000 units were sold at about $2,000 each in the first two months for an initial sales volume of about $20 million.\n\n5\nOn April 14, 1981, a Certificate of Copyright Registration for the audiovisual work \"Scramble\" was issued to Konami by the United States Copyright Office, and shortly thereafter documents were filed with the Copyright Office reflecting the license and sub-license to Stern. To satisfy the statutory requirement for deposit of copies of a work to be copyrighted, 17 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 408(b) (1976), Konami submitted video tape recordings of the \"Scramble\" game, both in its \"attract mode\" and in its \"play mode.\"2\n\n6\nOmni alleges that, concurrently with Stern's sales of the \"Scramble\" game and even earlier, it was endeavoring to sell a line of video game products so constructed that each unit could be equipped for playing different games by substituting a PROM containing the program for a particular game. Omni contends that it planned to market this line of interchangeable games with the label \"Scramble\" affixed to the headboard of each unit; the name of the particular game was also to be prominently displayed. On December 1, 1980, Omni's president ordered ten silk screen name plates bearing the name \"Scramble.\" Between that date and March 17, 1981, the date of Stern's first sale of its \"Scramble\" game, Omni sold five units of video games bearing the name \"Scramble\" on the headboard. In April 1981 Omni began to sell a video game called \"Scramble\" that not only bears the same name as the \"Scramble\" game Stern was then marketing, but also is virtually identical in both sight and sound. It sold this copy of Stern's \"Scramble\" game, known in the trade as a \"knock-off,\" for several hundred dollars less than Stern's game.\n\n1. Copyright Issues\n\n7\nIn challenging the preliminary injunction that bars distribution of its \"Scramble\" game, Omni does not dispute that Konami and its sub-licensee Stern are entitled to secure some copyright protection for their \"Scramble\" game. Omni contends that Konami was entitled to copyright only the written computer program that determines the sights and sounds of the game's audiovisual display.3 While that approach would have afforded some degree of protection, it would not have prevented a determined competitor from manufacturing a \"knock-off\" of \"Scramble\" that replicates precisely the sights and sounds of the game's audiovisual display. This could be done by writing a new computer program that would interact with the hardware components of a video game to produce on the screen the same images seen in \"Scramble,\" accompanied by the same sounds. Such replication is possible because many different computer programs can produce the same \"results,\" whether those results are an analysis of financial records or a sequence of images and sounds. A program is simply \"a set of statements (i.e., data) or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result,\" Pub.L.No. 96-517, \u00a7 10(a), 94 Stat. 3015, 3028 (1980) (amending 17 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 101 (1976)). To take an elementary example, the result of displaying a \"4\" can be achieved by an instruction to add 2 and 2, subtract 3 from 7, or in a variety of other ways. Obviously, writing a new program to replicate the play of \"Scramble\" requires a sophisticated effort, but it is a manageable task.\n\n8\nTo secure protection against the risk of a \"knock-off\" of \"Scramble\" based upon an original program, Konami eschewed registration of its program as a literary work and chose instead to register the sights and sounds of \"Scramble\" as an audiovisual work. See 17 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 102(a)(6) (1976). The Act defines \"audiovisual works\" as \"works that consist of a series of related images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines, or devices such as projectors, viewers, or electronic equipment, together with accompanying sounds, if any, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as films or tapes, in which the works are embodied.\" 17 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 101 (1976). Omni contends that Konami is not entitled to secure a copyright in the sights and sounds of its \"Scramble\" game because the audiovisual work is neither \"fixed in any tangible medium of expression\" nor \"original\" within the meaning of \u00a7 102(a). Both contentions arise from the fact that the sequence of some of the images appearing on the screen during each play of the game will vary depending upon the actions taken by the player. For example, if he fails to avoid enemy fire, his spaceship will be destroyed; if he fails to destroy enough fuel depots, his own fuel supply will run out, and his spaceship will crash; if he succeeds in destroying missile sites and enemy planes, those images will disappear from the screen; and the precise course travelled by his spaceship will depend upon his adjustment of the craft's altitude and velocity.\n\n9\nIf the content of the audiovisual display were not affected by the participation of the player, there would be no doubt that the display itself, and not merely the written computer program, would be eligible for copyright. The display satisfies the statutory definition of an original \"audiovisual work,\" and the memory devices of the game satisfy the statutory requirement of a \"copy\" in which the work is \"fixed.\"4 The Act defines \"copies\" as \"material objects ... in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device\" and specifies that a work is \"fixed\" when \"its embodiment in a copy ... is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\" 17 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 101 (1976). The audiovisual work is permanently embodied in a material object, the memory devices, from which it can be perceived with the aid of the other components of the game.\n\n10\nWe agree with the District Court that the player's participation does not withdraw the audiovisual work from copyright eligibility. No doubt the entire sequence of all the sights and sounds of the game are different each time the game is played, depending upon the route and speed the player selects for his spaceship and the timing and accuracy of his release of his craft's bombs and lasers. Nevertheless, many aspects of the sights and the sequence of their appearance remain constant during each play of the game. These include the appearance (shape, color, and size) of the player's spaceship, the enemy craft, the ground missile bases and fuel depots, and the terrain over which (and beneath which) the player's ship flies, as well as the sequence in which the missile bases, fuel depots, and terrain appears. Also constant are the sounds heard whenever the player successfully destroys an enemy craft or installation or fails to avoid an enemy missile or laser. It is true, as appellants contend, that some of these sights and sounds will not be seen and heard during each play of the game in the event that the player's spaceship is destroyed before the entire course is traversed. But the images remain fixed, capable of being seen and heard each time a player succeeds in keeping his spaceship aloft long enough to permit the appearances of all the images and sounds of a complete play of the game. The repetitive sequence of a substantial portion of the sights and sounds of the game qualifies for copyright protection as an audiovisual work.\n\n11\nAppellants' claim that the work lacks originality proceeds along two lines. Repeating their attack on fixation, they assert that each play of the game is an original work because of the player's participation. The videotape of a particular play of the game, they assert, secured protection only for that one \"original\" display. However, the repeated appearance of the same sequence of numerous sights and sounds in each play of the game defeats this branch of the argument. Attacking from the opposite flank, appellants contend that the audiovisual display contains no originality because all of its reappearing features are determined by the previously created computer program. This argument is also without merit. The visual and aural features of the audiovisual display are plainly original variations sufficient to render the display copyrightable even though the underlying written program has an independent existence and is itself eligible for copyright. Nor is copyright defeated because the audiovisual work and the computer program are both embodied in the same components of the game. The same thing occurs when an audio tape embodies both a musical composition and a sound recording. Moreover, the argument overlooks the sequence of the creative process. Someone first conceived what the audiovisual display would look like and sound like. Originality occurred at that point. Then the program was written. Finally, the program was imprinted into the memory devices so that, in operation with the components of the game, the sights and sounds could be seen and heard. The resulting display satisfies the requirement of an original work.\n\n12\nWe need not decide at what point the repeating sequence of images would form too insubstantial a portion of an entire display to warrant a copyright, nor the somewhat related issue of whether a sequence of images (e.g., a spaceship shooting down an attacking plane) might contain so little in the way of particularized form of expression as to be only an abstract idea portrayed in noncopyrightable form, see Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119, 121 (2d Cir. 1930), cert. denied, 282 U.S. 902, 51 S.Ct. 216, 75 L.Ed. 795 (1931). Assessing the entire effect of the game as it appears and sounds, we conclude that its repetitive sequence of images is copyrightable as an audiovisual display. See Atari, Inc. v. Amusement World, Inc., No. 81-803 (D.Md. Nov. 27, 1981); Midway Manufacturing Co. v. Drikschneider, No. 81-0-243 (D.Neb. July 15, 1981); Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Artic International, Inc., Civ. No. 81-1852 (D.N.J. June 24, 1981); Cinematronics, Inc. v. K. Noma Enterprise Co., Civ. No. 81-439 (D.Ariz. May 22, 1981).\n\n2. Trademark Issue\n\n13\nAppellants contend that they, rather than appellee, have superior common law rights in the mark \"SCRAMBLE\" based on their use of the mark in the United States in early 1981, prior to appellants' use. The District Court found that appellants' prior use was not bona fide and that appellee's use entitled it to injunctive relief against appellants' use. We agree.\n\n14\nThough there is no direct evidence that Omni learned of the \"SCRAMBLE\" mark because of the planned use of the mark by Konami and Stern, that inference was available to the District Court, at least for purposes of considering Stern's entitlement to a preliminary injunction. Omni appears to have attempted only a preemptive use of the mark by ordering just ten name plates with the mark and affixing just five of them to headboards of units of separately named games sold in early 1981. Cf. La Societe Anonyme Des Parfum LeGalion v. Jean Patou, Inc., 495 F.2d 1265 (2d Cir. 1974). The District Court was entitled to conclude that Omni was simply attaching a secondary label in a bad faith attempt to reserve a mark. Blue Bell, Inc. v. Farah Manufacturing Co., 508 F.2d 1260 (5th Cir. 1975); Blue Bell, Inc. v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc., 497 F.2d 433 (2d Cir. 1974). Omni's claim that it sought to establish a trade name for its line of separately named, interchangeable games is undermined by the fact that once it secured a \"knock-off\" of Stern's \"Scramble\" game, it affixed only the mark \"SCRAMBLE\", thereby designating the name of the game, and not the line of which it was a part. As Judge Nickerson observed, \"(I)t would be a truly remarkable coincidence if defendants independently thought of the name 'Scramble' and then, only a few months later, produced a video game virtually identical to the one bearing the same name. It is more likely that defendants sought to appropriate the trademark with the expectation that they would later imitate the audiovisual display.\"\n\n15\nMoreover, the equities abundantly justified issuance of an injunction against Omni's use of the mark. Stern has a substantial investment in the mark, having achieved success in the marketplace with its sales of a large number of units bearing the mark. By contrast, Omni has placed the mark on the headboard of five units of games that are not \"Scramble\" and has used the mark for a \"Scramble\" game that is a pirated \"knock-off\" of Stern's game.\n\n16\nThe preliminary injunction is affirmed.\n\n*\nThe Honorable Edward Dumbauld of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation\n\n1\nMemory devices of computers are generally either RAM (random access memory) or ROM (read only memory). RAM, used in most sophisticated computers, is a memory device in which stored information can be changed simply by writing in new information that replaces old information. The stored information in a ROM cannot be changed; it is imprinted into the ROM when the device is manufactured. A PROM is a ROM into which information can be imprinted (programmed) after manufacture; once the information is programmed in a PROM, it cannot be changed simply by writing in a new program. See A.

First, whether the district court erred in construing the claim term \"tagging.\"[bookmark: r[1]][1] Second, whether the district court properly constructed the term \"optimal,\" and properly instructed the jury on the construction.[bookmark: r[2]][2] Third, whether the district court erred in allowing Akamai to present a lost profits theory based on the testimony of its expert.\n\nBecause the district court did not err in its claim constructions and appropriately instructed the jury, and because we find no error in the district court's allowance of Akamai's lost profits expert, we decline Limelight's invitation to find an alternate basis to overturn the jury verdict on infringement and its damages award. Accordingly, we reiterate the en banc court's reversal of the district court's grant of JMOL of non-infringement and remand with instructions to reinstitute the jury's original verdict and damages award. We also confirm our previously reinstated affirmance of the district court's judgment of non-infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,553,413 (the \"'413 patent\") and 7,103,645 (the \"'645 patent\").\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nA. The Technology and the Nature of the Dispute\n\nA detailed description of the technology and the claims at issue in this case is set forth in the prior reported opinions of this court and the Supreme Court and will not be repeated except to the extent germane hereto. See Akamai IV, 797 F.3d 1020; Limelight Networks, Inc. v. Akamai Techs., Inc., ___ U.S. ___, 134 S.Ct. 2111, 189 L.Ed.2d 52 (2014); Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc. (Akamai III), 629 F.3d 1311 (Fed.Cir.2010).\n\nB. Prior Proceedings\n\nIn 2006, Akamai sued Limelight in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts asserting infringement of claims 19-21 and 34 of the '703 patent, along with certain claims of the '413 and '645 patents. After the district court's first claim construction order, Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc., 494 F.Supp.2d 34 (D.Mass.2007), Akamai stipulated that it could not prove infringement of the '645 patent under the district court's construction. The district court thus entered judgment of non-infringement. The district court subsequently entered summary judgment of non-infringement of the asserted claims of the '413 patent.\n\nAs relates to the '703 patent, the parties stipulated to a construction of \"tagging\" in claims 17, 19, and 34 of the '703 patent as \"providing a `pointer' or `hook' so that the object resolves to a domain other than the 1373*1373 content provider domain.\" Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc. (Akamai I), No. 06-11109, 2008 WL 697707, at *1 (D.Mass. Feb. 8, 2008). The meaning of this term was not disputed until Limelight requested a jury instruction explaining that tagging could only be accomplished by \"either prepending or inserting a virtual server hostname into the URL,\" and filed Rule 50 motions for judgment of non-infringement because the accused products did not tag in this way. The district court denied the requested jury instruction and the Rule 50 motions.\n\nThe parties also stipulated that \"to resolve to a domain other than the content provider domain\" in claims 17, 19, and 34 of the '703 patent should be construed as \"to specify a particular group of computers that does not include the content provider from which an optimal server is to be selected.\" Akamai I, 2008 WL 697707 at *1 (emphasis added). However, the parties disagreed on the meaning of the word \"optimal\" in the construction, with Limelight arguing that a single optimal server must be selected, and Akamai arguing that several servers could be \"optimal\" if they each met some criteria. Id. The district court construed \"optimal server\" as \"requir[ing] the selection of a content server that is better than other possible choices in terms of the criteria established by the specification.\" Id. at *3.\n\nAkamai's claim that Limelight infringed the '703 patent proceeded to a jury trial. The district court instructed the jury on \"tagging\" per the stipulation discussed above, and added the following gloss for \"an optimal server\":\n\none or more content servers that are better than other possible choices considering some or all of the following criteria: (1) being close to end users; (2) not overloaded; (3) tailored to viewers in a particular location; (4) most likely to already have a current version of the required file; and (5) dependent on network conditions.\n\nTo prove damages, Akamai relied heavily on the testimony of its expert, Dr. Keith Ugone's calculation of Akamai's lost-profits. Dr. Ugone considered the elasticity of the market for content delivery network services, the competition between Akamai and Limelight, and the price disparity between Akamai's and Limelight's products. Ultimately, Dr. Ugone concluded that but-for Limelight's infringement, Akamai would have collected about $74 million.\n\nThe jury returned a verdict of infringement and awarded Akamai approximately $40 million in lost profits, $1.4 million in reasonable royalty damages, and $4 million in price erosion damages. As noted, supra, the district court did not let the verdict stand and, instead, granted JMOL of no infringement. Akamai II, 614 F.Supp.2d at 96.\n\nAkamai appealed the district court's rulings regarding all three patents-in-suit and Limelight cross-appealed. This court rejected Akamai's argument that Limelight's cross-appeal was improper, Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc., No.2009-1372, 2010 WL 331770 (Fed.Cir. Jan. 27, 2010) (Order), and subsequently affirmed the district court's rulings regarding the '413 and '645 patents. Akamai III, 629 F.3d at 1322-31. The portion of this court's Akamai III opinion dealing with the '645 and '413 patents, though initially vacated upon grant of en banc rehearing, Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc., 419 Fed.Appx. 989 (Fed.Cir.2011), was later reinstated, see Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc., 786 F.3d 899, 903-904 (Fed. Cir.2015) (explaining procedural history), overruled en banc on other grounds by Akamai IV, 797 F.3d 1020. As noted, supra, this court reversed the non-infringement judgment and returned the 1374*1374 case to this panel for resolution of all residual issues. Akamai IV, 797 F.3d at 1025.\n\nThis court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).\n\nII. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\nThe \"ultimate interpretation\" of a claim term, as well as interpretations of \"evidence intrinsic to the patent (the patent claims and specifications, along with the patent's prosecution history),\" are legal conclusions, which this court reviews de novo. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., ___ U.S. ___, 135 S.Ct. 831, 841, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2015). Review of the district court's interpretation of the parties' pre-trial stipulations is \"much like\" review of any contract interpretation, see Scanner Techs. Corp. v. ICOS Vision Sys. Corp. N.V., 528 F.3d 1365, 1383 (Fed.Cir. 2008): this court reviews underlying factual findings for clear error and reviews the ultimate interpretation of the stipulation de novo, see Teva, 135 S.Ct. at 837-38.\n\nThis court reviews challenges to jury instructions, grants or denials of motions for JMOL, and questions of judicial estoppel under the law of the regional circuit where the district court sits. See AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co., KG v. Janssen Biotech, Inc., 759 F.3d 1285, 1295 (Fed.Cir.2014); Source Search Techs., LLC v. LendingTree, LLC, 588 F.3d 1063, 1071 (Fed.Cir.2009). \"When examining preserved claims of instructional error, [the First Circuit] afford[s] de novo review to questions as to whether jury instructions capture the essence of the applicable law, while reviewing for abuse of discretion the court's choice of phraseology.\" Ira Green, Inc. v. Military Sales & Servs. Co., 775 F.3d 12, 18 (1st Cir.2014) (citations omitted). The First Circuit \"review[s] the district court's grant or denial of judgment as a matter of law de novo ... viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict-winner, and vacating the jury verdict only if it lacks a sufficient evidentiary basis.\" Kennedy v. Town of Billerica, 617 F.3d 520, 537 (1st Cir.2010). The First Circuit \"review[s] the district court's decision not to invoke judicial estoppel for abuse of discretion ... accept[ing] the trial court's findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous, and evaluat[ing] its answers to abstract questions of law de novo.\" Knowlton v. Shaw, 704 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir.2013) (citations omitted).\n\n\"Whether lost profits are legally compensable in a particular situation is a question of law that we review de novo.\" Siemens Med. Solutions USA, Inc. v. Saint-Gobain Ceramics & Plastics, Inc., 637 F.3d 1269, 1287 (Fed.Cir.2011).\n\nB. Claim Construction\n\n1. \"[T]agging\"\n\nIn a prior litigation relating to the '703 patent, the district court construed \"tagging\" as \"providing a `pointer' or `hook' so that the object resolves to a domain other than the content provider domain.\" Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Digital Island, No. 00-11851-RWZ, 2001 WL 36172136, at *1 (D.Mass. Nov. 8, 2001). The district court defined \"to resolve to a domain other than the content provider domain\" as \"to specify a particular group of computers that does not include the content provider from which an optimal server is to be selected.\" Id. (emphasis added). The parties accepted these constructions by stipulation in the instant case. Akamai I, 2008 WL 697707 at *1. This construction was not disputed during the Markman hearing, and was first challenged by Limelight in attempting to re-craft the construction for the jury instructions.\n\n1375*1375 Limelight argues that: 1) in the context of the '703 patent, \"tagging\" is necessarily limited to using a \"pointer\" or \"hook\" that either prepends or inserts a virtual server hostname into the URL because the '703 patent discloses no other way to \"tag\" to achieve the goals of the invention; and 2) that \"alphanumeric string\" as used in the '645 patent (and which this court has construed to necessarily include prepending or inserting a virtual server hostname in the URL) is the product of tagging in the '703 patent, which necessarily means that the '703 patent incorporates the same limitations as the '645 patent. Akamai counters that: 1) Limelight waived the argument by failing to assert it during Markman and again failing to assert it after the jury instructions were read; 2) the stipulation to which Limelight agreed was made without further limitation of the types of \"hook\" or \"pointer\" to use, and is thus binding on Limelight; 3) \"tagging\" in the '703 patent is not equivalent to \"alphanumeric string\" in the '645 patent; 4) certain claims in the '703 patent specifically require prepending while others don't, and claim differentiation requires that the broader term \"tagging\" thus not be limited to prepending; 5) prepending is merely a preferred embodiment and Limelight is improperly attempting to limit the claim scope to a preferred embodiment; and 6) Limelight argued that the asserted claims lacked written description because the specification taught that the only way to tag was to prepend a virtual hostname into an existing URL \u2014 but the jury rejected this argument.\n\nLimelight's attempt to import a \"prepending\" limitation into the claims fails. \"[O]ur cases recognize that the specification may reveal a special definition given to a claim term by the patentee that differs from the meaning it would otherwise possess. In such cases, the inventor's lexicography governs.\" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1316 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc). However, a claim term is only given a special definition different from the term's plain and ordinary meaning if the \"patentee ... clearly set[s] forth a definition of the disputed claim term other than its plain and ordinary meaning.\" Thorner v. Sony Comput. Entm't Am., LLC, 669 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2012) (citations omitted). A patentee can also disavow claim scope, but the standard \"is similarly exacting.\" Id. at 1366. \"[C]laims are not necessarily and not usually limited in scope simply to the preferred embodiment.\" RF Del. v. Pac. Keystone Techs., Inc., 326 F.3d 1255, 1263 (Fed.Cir.2003).\n\nThe '703 patent describes prepending as a \"prefer[ence].\" '703 patent, col.4 ll.2-3. Figure 4 describes \"prepend[ing a] virtual server host name,\" but the patent likewise describes Figure 4 as showing the \"preferred\" method. Id. at col.6 ll.44-45. The patent's reference to preferred embodiments where the virtual server host-name is prepended does not provide the clarity necessary to find that the patentees intended to limit the term tagging to the preferred embodiment. Moreover, claim 17 of the '703 patent expressly recites \"tagging ... by pre-pending,\" suggesting that the term \"tagging\" \u2014 without modification and as recited in the asserted claims \u2014 is not so limited. See Ancora Techs., Inc. v. Apple, Inc., 744 F.3d 732, 735 (Fed.Cir. 2014) (explaining that using the phrase \"application software program\" in one claim, and \"program\" alone in another \"tends to reinforce ... adoption of the broad ordinary meaning of `program' by itself\").\n\nThe prosecution history cited by Limelight also fails to provide the necessary clarity to limit \"tagging\" to the preferred embodiment. During prosecution, Akamai amended what is now claim 17 to require 1376*1376 tagging \"by prepending\" and amended claim 19 to require that the content provider \"serv[e] the given page\" and that the Content Delivery Network serve the embedded image. In their remarks, the applicants stated that \"the embedded object URL is modified ... to prepend given data to the domain name and path normally used to retrieve the embedded object.\" In view of the amendment now requiring claim 17 to tag \"by prepending,\" a person of skill in the art could reasonably understand the applicants' description of prepending the data as referring only to claim 17. This statement therefore does not provide the necessary clarity required for disavowal in claim 19.\n\nLimelight claims that the only method of tagging described in the '703 patent involves prepending a virtual server hostname. However, as this court has held, \"even where a patent describes only a single embodiment, claims will not be read restrictively unless the patentee has demonstrated a clear intention to limit the claim scope using words or expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction.\" Innova/Pure Water, Inc. v. Safari Water Filtration Sys., 381 F.3d 1111, 1117 (Fed.Cir. 2004) (internal citations omitted). As explained above, no such indication of exclusion appears in the patent specification or prosecution history.\n\nWe note that the district court read to the jury the construction of \"tagging\" to which Limelight stipulated. Though Limelight points to O2 Micro International Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Technology Co., 521 F.3d 1351, 1361 (Fed. Cir.2008), for the proposition that its stipulation did not \"give up any right to argue that further construction or interpretation of tagging would be needed,\" that case is inapposite. In O2 Micro, the Court was clearly aware of the parties' disagreement about the claim term \"only if,\" and the Court refused to construe it beyond its ordinary meaning. Id. at 1357 (\"The parties agreed, for the most part, that a previously issued claim construction order ... controlled in this case .... However, the parties presented a handful of additional terms for the court to construe [of which \"only if\" was one].\"); id. at 1361 (\"The parties presented a dispute to the district court regarding the scope of the asserted claims.\"). See also id. at 1361 (\"[T]he parties disputed not the meaning of the words themselves, but the scope that should be encompassed by this claim language.\" (emphasis in original)). Here, the parties agreed in the stipulation as to both the meaning and the scope of the term during claim construction: \"tagging\" means \"providing a `pointer' or `hook' so that the object resolves to a domain other than the content provider domain.\" This meaning was agreed-upon with no further limitations. The lack of further limitations was itself a characteristic of the construction to which both parties agreed. Limelight cannot argue at the jury instruction stage \u2014 after the bulk of the trial was framed and directed by the Markman construction to which it agreed \u2014 that the construction was somehow too broad. Limelight stipulated to a construction of \"tagging,\" and it is bound by that stipulation.\n\nWe find no error in the district court's claim construction of \"tagging\" or the jury instruction pursuant thereto. The parties do not assert that there is any remaining issue of fact as to whether Limelight performs \"tagging\" (apart from the \"optimal server\" issue addressed below).\n\n2. \"[A]n optimal server\"\n\nThe second remaining dispute is whether \"an optimal server\" is necessarily limited to a single \"best\" server, or can refer to several potentially optimal servers from which content is retrieved.\n\n1377*1377 The phrase \"optimal server\" does not appear in the patent. Instead, it is nested within the parties' stipulated claim constructions as follows. \"Tagging\" was stipulated to mean \"providing a `pointer' or `hook' so that the object resolves to a domain other than the content provider domain.\" The phrase \"to resolve to a domain other than the content provider domain\" was stipulated to mean \"to specify a particular group of computers that does not include the content provider from which an optimal server is to be selected.\" Substituting the stipulated constructions into claim 19 results in the following, with emphasis added:\n\n19 [substituted]. A content delivery service, comprising....\n\nfor a given page normally served from the content provider domain, providing a `pointer' or `hook' to embedded objects on the page so that requests for those objects specify a particular group of computers that does not include the content provider from which an optimal server is to be selected\n\n. . . .\n\nserving at least one embedded object of the given page from a given content server in the domain instead of from the content provider domain.\n\nDuring the Markman hearing, the parties disputed the meaning of \"an optimal server.\" The district court construed claim 19 to require \"the content delivery system to serve an embedded object from one or more content servers which are `[m]ost favorable or desirable,' that is, servers which meet some or all of the criteria described in the specification.\" In the jury instruction, the district court elaborated on the criteria, explaining that \"an optimal server\" was: \"one or more content servers that are better than other possible choices considering some or all of the following criteria: (1) being close to end users; (2) not overloaded; (3) tailored to viewers in a particular location; (4) most likely to already have a current version of the required file; and (5) depend[e]nt on network conditions.\"\n\nLimelight argues that: 1) the unambiguous meaning of \"optimal\" is necessarily restricted to a single aggregate \"best\" server; 2) the court's ambiguous construction improperly left a claim construction issue for the jury; and 3) Akamai is judicially estopped from arguing that \"optimal\" does not require a single \"best\" server by its statements equating \"optimal\" to \"best.\"\n\nLimelight's arguments are unconvincing. First, Limelight fails to appreciate the context of the selection of \"an optimal server\" in the claim. The selection of \"an optimal server\" describes the functionality enabled by the necessary \"tagging.\" In other words, the embedded objects are tagged such that a group of computers is identified, and from which an optimal server is chosen. The '703 patent is replete with examples in which conditions or circumstances independent of the tag influence which server ultimately serves the embedded object. The tagging described in the '703 patent thus allows for the tag to ultimately lead to service from more than a single possible server. When the browser makes a request for an object, then the software on the ghost does the following: \"If a copy of the file is already stored on the ghost, then the data is returned immediately. If, however, no copy of the data on the ghost exists, a copy is retrieved from the original server or another ghost server.\" '703 patent, col.12, ll.31-35. Similarly, the specification explains that the tagging allows \"a ghost server [to] redirect the user to a closer server (or to another virtual address that is likely to be resolved to a server that is closer to the client).\" Id. at col.12, ll.44-47. And again, \"[p]erformance for long downloads can also be 1378*1378 improved by dynamically changing the server to which a client is connected based on changing network conditions.\" Id. at col.12, ll.53-55.\n\nThese examples undermine Limelight's position in two ways. First, the tagging of the embedded objects provides the capability to select a server, and then select a different server \u2014 in other words, tagging enables the selection of one of several servers. Second, the criteria for server selection are not aggregated during tagging, wherein the system only allows serving from the single server that is the \"winner\" of the aggregated criteria. Instead, in one instance, a server may be chosen because it is closest to the user; in another instance, because another server does not have the file; and in yet another instance, because of overload of the server or network conditions. Choosing based on any of these criteria is indicated as a capability of the claimed tagging system \u2014 not merely choosing a single \"aggregate best\" server. Nothing in the patent limits the functionality of the tag to selecting an \"aggregate best\" \u2014 indeed, which criteria is ultimately decisive is not a function of the tag, but occurs while the objects are served.\n\nThis reading is confirmed by dependent claims 21 and 22, which further limit the serving step in claim 19 to \"resolving a request to the domain as a function of a requesting user's location,\" '703 patent, cl. 21, or \"resolving a request to the domain as a function of a requesting user's location and then-current Internet traffic conditions,\" id. at cl. 22. In other words, determining the ultimate server from which the embedded object will be served using one particular criteria, or two criteria. Nothing in the specification or the claims implies that these two functionalities would necessarily return the aggregate best server, or that the two rules would return the same server. Limelight argues that this identification of \"one or more content servers\" is an additional step identifying the list of all possible content servers from which the optimum server is selected. Limelight Supp. Opening Br. at 4. Limelight ignores that claim 20 is limiting \"the serving step,\" which occurs after the tagging step.\n\nLimelight's argument that the \"unambiguous\" meaning of \"optimal\" is a single \"best\" is also unconvincing. As discussed above, the intrinsic evidence supports the district court's construction. Moreover, neither the plain meaning of \"optimal\" nor the plain meaning of \"best\" is as limited as Limelight suggests to an \"aggregate best\" or \"aggregate optimal.\"\n\nThe district court's construction did not improperly leave a claim construction issue for the jury by not construing a disputed term. The district court construed optimal server during the Markman hearing as described above, and elaborated during jury instructions that \"an optimal server\" was: \"one or more content servers that are better than other possible choices considering some or all of the following criteria: (1) being close to end users; (2) not overloaded; (3) tailored to viewers in a particular location; (4) most likely to already have a current version of the required file; and (5) depend[e]nt on network conditions.\" Nothing in the construction or the jury instructions requires the jury to construe the term. Limelight merely disagrees with the construction the district court adopted.\n\nFinally, Akamai's use of \"optimal\" and \"best\" in the prior litigation does not estop Akamai from arguing that \"optimal\" allows for serving from other than a single composite best server because the point at issue in the discussions cited was distinct from the issue here. Limelight points to a colloquy wherein the district court questioned Akamai's counsel about the functionality and sequencing of the tagging step, and Akamai's counsel stated: \"at 1379*1379 some time during the serving of that object, picking the best computer to serve that object, that's during the serving step, identifying the best computer,\" and also agreed with the district court's categorization that the process \"is two steps. It tags to find the best domain and then also identifies the best computer or server within that domain.\" Limelight's reliance on this colloquy is misplaced. The discussion in that case was about the role of tagging, and Akamai's attorney explained that the timing of the tagging step occurs with the selection of a domain, but that the selection of the \"best computer\" occurs during the object serving step. The issue of whether tagging enables serving from only a single \"optimal server\" or from a server which performs better than others within a particular criteria was never addressed.\n\nFor these reasons, there is no error in the district court's construction of \"an optimal server,\" nor in the jury instruction.\n\nC. Damages\n\nTo collect lost profits, a \"patentee must show `a reasonable probability that `but for' the infringing activity, the patentee would have made the infringer's sales.\" Ericsson, Inc. v. Harris Corp., 352 F.3d 1369, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2004) (citations omitted). This is done by determining what profits the patentee would have made absent the infringing product. Id. This analysis must be supported by \"sound economic proof of the nature of the market and likely outcomes with infringement factored out of the economic picture.\" Id. (citing Grain Processing Corp. v. Am. Maize-Prods. Co., 185 F.3d 1341, 1350 (Fed.Cir. 1999)).\n\nLimelight argues the district court committed legal error in allowing lost profits as a measure of damages because Akamai failed to show a causal connection between Limelight's infringement and Akamai's lost profits. Limelight argues that Dr. Ugone's calculation of the share of Limelight's customers that would have gone to Akamai absent Limelight's infringement was arbitrary and not based in sound economic theory. The underlying basis for this argument is the price disparity between Limelight's and Akamai's products, which Limelight says Dr. Ugone either failed to incorporate into his analysis, or incorporated arbitrarily. Limelight's arguments are inapposite.\n\nLimelight originally sold a different, non-infringing service than the one at issue in this case. Limelight's infringing service was released in April of 2005. Dr. Ugone testified that in 2005 Akamai had a market share of 79.8% and Limelight had a market share of 5% and in 2006 Akamai had a market share of 74.7% and Limelight had a market share of 10.7%. Dr. Ugone then calculated an adjusted market share[bookmark: r[3]][3] for the years when Limelight's infringing service was on the market and concluded that, assuming Limelight only sold its earlier software, Akamai's market share would have been 81% in 2005 and 79.9% in 2006. Because he did not have sufficient data to determine the market share for 2007, he assumed it would be the same as the market share for 2006. For the sake of \"conservatism,\" Dr. Ugone reduced Akamai's share by 3% and excluded the lowest earning 25% of Limelight's customers who he categorized as particularly price sensitive consumers, who may be unlikely to purchase a higher-priced alternative without Limelight's infringing products in the market. Subject to these assumptions and modifications, Dr. Ugone 1380*1380 opined that Limelight's infringing sales totaled approximately $87.5 million.\n\nThe lost profit analysis was complicated by the fact that Limelight sold its product for half the price of Akamai's. This affected Dr. Ugone's calculations in two ways. First, he assumed that in the but-for world where Limelight did not sell an infringing product, Akamai would sell its product to some of those customers for twice as much as Limelight had. Second, because of the difference in price between Akamai's product and Limelight's product, Dr. Ugone assumed that the demand for Akamai's product would be 25% less than the demand for Limelight's infringing products. Dr. Ugone explained that, in economics, how a change in price affects a change in demand is described as \"elasticity.\" The more elastic the demand, the more sensitive it is to change. A demand is described as \"inelastic\" if, when the price changes by a certain percentage, the demand changes by a smaller percentage. As Dr. Ugone explained, \"if you change prices by 10 percent and quantity demanded changes by only 5 percent ... that's an example of something we call inelastic.\"\n\nDr. Ugone opined that the demand for Akamai's products was relatively inelastic (i.e. relatively price-insensitive) and provided two justifications for calculating that 75% of Limelight's sales would potentially have been made by Akamai. First, because Akamai's costs were \"revenue-generating costs,\" customers would be more willing to expend money to buy Akamai's product. Second, though there would be some \"price sensitivity\" such that some of Limelight's customers would not purchase the higher-priced Akamai product, the demand was relatively inelastic \u2014 meaning the quantity demanded would not change as much as the price changed. The relative inelasticity of demand was supported by Akamai's evidence that Akamai and Limelight were direct competitors, including statements by Limelight that 1) Akamai was its largest competitor; 2) \"Limelight and Akamai are, from a scale and quality standpoint, head and shoulders above the rest of ... Limelight's competition\"; 3) demand was driven by end-users not customers; and 4) Akamai maintained a dominant market share despite Limelight's infringing service and lower price. Dr. Ugone conceded that in picking 75% he \"had to make a judgment call based on the attributes and come to a conclusion what the adjustments would be.\" Based on his assumptions, Dr. Ugone determined that Akamai's lost profits were about $74 million.\n\nThe considerations outlined above sufficiently support the district court's decision to allow Dr. Ugone's adjusted lost-profits analysis. This court has repeatedly approved similar adjusted market share analyses for estimating lost profits. See, e.g. Ericsson, 352 F.3d at 1377-80. There is no basis for Limelight's claim that such an analysis here is legally unavailable.\n\nLimelight's argument appears to be that the price disparity between Akamai's and Limelight's prices necessarily created a market segmentation in which Akamai was separate from Limelight. Limelight's argument rests on BIC Leisure Prods., Inc. v. Windsurfing International, Inc., 1 F.3d 1214 (Fed.Cir.1993), where this court determined that lost profits were unavailable because the accused infringer and the patentee serviced different markets based on a 60-80% price disparity. Limelight argues that in the face of a 100% price disparity, lost profits are legally unavailable. However, this court's decision in BIC did not rest solely on the price disparity of the two companies. For one, the court noted that \"[the patentee] Windsurfing concentrated on the One Design class hull form and BIC [the infringer] did not. Windsurfing's boards differed fundamentally 1381*1381 from BIC's boards.\" Id. at 1218. Moreover, the court explained that \"at least fourteen competitors vied for sales in the sailboard market.\" Id. In the instant case, in contrast, Akamai presented evidence that Akamai and Limelight were direct competitors, and the two leaders in the field, with capabilities and infrastructure beyond those of its competitors. Next, the court in BIC explained that the \"record contains uncontradicted evidence that demand for sailboards is relatively elastic.\" Id. Again, the instant case is different \u2014 Dr. Ugone explained that the market was relatively inelastic, and set forth a number of reasons, discussed above, for this conclusion. Furthermore, the court noted that Windsurfing had licensed its patent to two competitors, both selling Boards similar to the patentee's Boards at significantly lower prices. Id. Finally, there was evidence that Windsurfing's \"sales continued to decline after the district court enjoined BIC's infringement,\" but that the market share indeed went to one of the patentee's licensees. Id. No such evidence exists here.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Ugone's 25% adjustment for market elasticity was sufficiently grounded in economic principles for the district court to allow it. Though Limelight is correct that its customers expressed a clear preference for lower-priced products \u2014 as evidenced by their buying Limelight's significantly cheaper product \u2014 and therefore would have been less likely to buy Akamai's products than the average consumer, Dr. Ugone's testimony took this consideration into account both in excluding the lowest 25% of Limelight's customers from his lost profits analysis, and for discounting the potential award for price elasticity. Whether this discount was sufficient is not a legal challenge to the availability of lost profits, but as to the amount of lost profits, which Limelight failed to address in its panel briefing.\n\nFor the first time in supplemental briefing, Limelight attempts to challenge the evidentiary basis for the amount of the jury's award, as distinct from the legal challenge to the availability of lost profits. Also for the first time in the supplemental briefing, Limelight argues that Dr. Ugone's 3% downward adjustment of Akamai's adjusted market share indicates an internal inconsistency, because the reduction was not carried through into the lost profits calculation. Because the supplemental briefing was limited to arguments contained in the panel briefing, Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc., XXXX-XXXX (Fed.Cir. Aug. 19, 2015) (non-precedential order) (\"[T]he parties are requested to file letter briefs supplementing the original briefing of Limelight's cross-appeal and limited to the issues raised therein.\" (emphasis added)), we need not consider this argument. Even if we were to consider it, we find it unconvincing.\n\nLimelight also appears to argue that the jury's damages award \"was unfairly tainted by the district court's refusal to instruct the jury that it should reject a los[t] profits claim based on speculative evidence.\" This argument is without merit. The district court did instruct the jury that \"[t]he amount of lost profits must be proved with reasonable certainty and cannot be left simply to speculation.\" The district court's instructions captured the applicable law.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\nThe en banc court reversed the district court's grant of Limelight's motion for JMOL of non-infringement of the '703 patent. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the outstanding arguments in Limelight's cross-appeal have no merit. Thus, this case is remanded with instructions to reinstate the jury verdict and the jury's damages award. This court's previously 1382*1382 reinstated affirmance of the district court's judgment of non-infringement of the '413 and '645 patents is also reconfirmed.\n\nAFFIRMED-IN-PART, REVERSED-IN-PART, AND REMANDED\n\nCOSTS\n\nEach party shall bear its own costs.\n\n[bookmark: [1]][1]  Limelight argues that the district court erred in its construction, and that the jury lacked sufficient evidence to find infringement in light of the correct construction.\n\n[bookmark: [2]][2]  Limelight argues both that the claim construction was erroneous, and that the subsequent jury instruction improperly left claim construction to the jury.\n\n[bookmark: [3]][3]  An adjusted market share is the calculated market share Akamai would have had absent infringement.", "annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 95},

Greenstein, Constantine Cannon LLP, Washington, DC, for Respondent.\n\nJustice BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Copyright Act of 1976 gives a copyright owner the \"exclusive righ[t]\" to \"perform the copyrighted work publicly.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(4). The Act's Transmit Clause defines that exclusive right as including the right to\n\n\"transmit or otherwise communicate a performance ... of the [copyrighted] work ... to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance ... receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.\" \u00a7 101. 2503*2503 We must decide whether respondent Aereo, Inc., infringes this exclusive right by selling its subscribers a technologically complex service that allows them to watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air. We conclude that it does.\n\nI\n\nA\n\nFor a monthly fee, Aereo offers subscribers broadcast television programming over the Internet, virtually as the programming is being broadcast. Much of this program-ming is made up of copyrighted works. Aereo neither owns the copyright in those works nor holds a license from the copyright owners to perform those works publicly.\n\nAereo's system is made up of servers, transcoders, and thousands of dime-sized antennas housed in a central warehouse. It works roughly as follows: First, when a subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently being broadcast, he visits Aereo's website and selects, from a list of the local programming, the show he wishes to see.\n\nSecond, one of Aereo's servers selects an antenna, which it dedicates to the use of that subscriber (and that subscriber alone) for the duration of the selected show. A server then tunes the antenna to the over-the-air broadcast carrying the show. The antenna begins to receive the broadcast, and an Aereo transcoder translates the signals received into data that can be transmitted over the Internet.\n\nThird, rather than directly send the data to the subscriber, a server saves the data in a subscriber-specific folder on Aereo's hard drive. In other words, Aereo's system creates a subscriber-specific copy \u2014 that is, a \"personal\" copy \u2014 of the subscriber's program of choice.\n\nFourth, once several seconds of programming have been saved, Aereo's server begins to stream the saved copy of the show to the subscriber over the Internet. (The subscriber may instead direct Aereo to stream the program at a later time, but that aspect of Aereo's service is not before us.) The subscriber can watch the streamed program on the screen of his personal computer, tablet, smart phone, Internet-connected television, or other Internet-connected device. The streaming continues, a mere few seconds behind the over-the-air broadcast, until the subscriber has received the entire show. See A Dictionary of Computing 494 (6th ed. 2008) (defining \"streaming\" as \"[t]he process of providing a steady flow of audio or video data so that an Internet user is able to access it as it is transmitted\").\n\nAereo emphasizes that the data that its system streams to each subscriber are the data from his own personal copy, made from the broadcast signals received by the particular antenna allotted to him. Its system does not transmit data saved in one subscriber's folder to any other subscriber. When two subscribers wish to watch the same program, Aereo's system activates two separate antennas and saves two separate copies of the program in two separate folders. It then streams the show to the subscribers through two separate transmissions \u2014 each from the subscriber's personal copy.\n\nB\n\nPetitioners are television producers, marketers, distributors, and broadcasters who own the copyrights in many of the programs that Aereo's system streams to its subscribers. They brought suit against Aereo for copyright infringement in Federal District Court. They sought a preliminary 2504*2504 injunction, arguing that Aereo was infringing their right to \"perform\" their works \"publicly,\" as the Transmit Clause defines those terms.\n\nThe District Court denied the preliminary injunction. 874 F.Supp.2d 373 (S.D.N.Y.2012). Relying on prior Circuit precedent, a divided panel of the Second Circuit affirmed. WNET, Thirteen v. Aereo, Inc., 712 F.3d 676 (2013) (citing Cartoon Network LP, LLLP v. CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F.3d 121 (2008)). In the Second Circuit's view, Aereo does not perform publicly within the meaning of the Transmit Clause because it does not transmit \"to the public.\" Rather, each time Aereo streams a program to a subscriber, it sends a private transmission that is available only to that subscriber. The Second Circuit denied rehearing en banc, over the dissent of two judges. WNET, Thirteen v. Aereo, Inc., 722 F.3d 500 (2013). We granted certiorari.\n\nII\n\nThis case requires us to answer two questions: First, in operating in the manner described above, does Aereo \"perform\" at all? And second, if so, does Aereo do so \"publicly\"? We address these distinct questions in turn.\n\nDoes Aereo \"perform\"? See \u00a7 106(4) (\"[T]he owner of [a] copyright ... has the exclusive righ[t] ... to perform the copyrighted work publicly\" (emphasis added)); \u00a7 101 (\"To perform ... a work `publicly' means [among other things] to transmit... a performance ... of the work ... to the public ...\" (emphasis added)). Phrased another way, does Aereo \"transmit... a performance\" when a subscriber watches a show using Aereo's system, or is it only the subscriber who transmits? In Aereo's view, it does not perform. It does no more than supply equipment that \"emulate[s] the operation of a home antenna and [digital video recorder (DVR) ].\" Brief for Respondent 41. Like a home antenna and DVR, Aereo's equipment simply responds to its subscribers' directives. So it is only the subscribers who \"perform\" when they use Aereo's equipment to stream television programs to themselves.\n\nConsidered alone, the language of the Act does not clearly indicate when an entity \"perform[s]\" (or \"transmit[s]\") and when it merely supplies equipment that allows others to do so. But when read in light of its purpose, the Act is unmistakable: An entity that engages in activities like Aereo's performs.\n\nA\n\nHistory makes plain that one of Congress' primary purposes in amending the Copyright Act in 1976 was to overturn this Court's determination that community antenna television (CATV) systems (the precursors of modern cable systems) fell outside the Act's scope. In Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 U.S. 390, 88 S.Ct. 2084, 20 L.Ed.2d 1176 (1968), the Court considered a CATV system that carried local television broadcasting, much of which was copyrighted, to its subscribers in two cities. The CATV provider placed antennas on hills above the cities and used coaxial cables to carry the signals received by the antennas to the home television sets of its subscribers. The system amplified and modulated the signals in order to improve their strength and efficiently transmit them to subscribers. A subscriber \"could choose any of the ... programs he wished to view by simply turning the knob on his own television set.\" Id., at 392, 88 S.Ct. 2084. The CATV provider \"neither edited the programs received nor originated any programs of its own.\" Ibid.\n\nAsked to decide whether the CATV provider infringed copyright holders' exclusive 2505*2505 right to perform their works publicly, the Court held that the provider did not \"perform\" at all. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1(c) (1964 ed.) (granting copyright holder the exclusive right to \"perform ... in public for profit\" a nondramatic literary work), \u00a7 1(d) (granting copyright holder the exclusive right to \"perform ... publicly\" a dramatic work). The Court drew a line: \"Broadcasters perform. Viewers do not perform.\" 392 U.S., at 398, 88 S.Ct. 2084 (footnote omitted). And a CATV provider \"falls on the viewer's side of the line.\" Id., at 399, 88 S.Ct. 2084.\n\nThe Court reasoned that CATV providers were unlike broadcasters:\n\n\"Broadcasters select the programs to be viewed; CATV systems simply carry, without editing, whatever programs they receive. Broadcasters procure programs and propagate them to the public; CATV systems receive programs that have been released to the public and carry them by private channels to additional viewers.\" Id., at 400, 88 S.Ct. 2084.\n\nInstead, CATV providers were more like viewers, for \"the basic function [their] equipment serves is little different from that served by the equipment generally furnished by\" viewers. Id., at 399, 88 S.Ct. 2084. \"Essentially,\" the Court said, \"a CATV system no more than enhances the viewer's capacity to receive the broadcaster's signals [by] provid[ing] a well-located antenna with an efficient connection to the viewer's television set.\" Ibid. Viewers do not become performers by using \"amplifying equipment,\" and a CATV provider should not be treated differently for providing viewers the same equipment. Id., at 398-400, 88 S.Ct. 2084.\n\nIn Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U.S. 394, 94 S.Ct. 1129, 39 L.Ed.2d 415 (1974), the Court considered the copyright liability of a CATV provider that carried broadcast television programming into subscribers' homes from hundreds of miles away. Although the Court recognized that a viewer might not be able to afford amplifying equipment that would provide access to those distant signals, it nonetheless found that the CATV provider was more like a viewer than a broadcaster. Id., at 408-409, 94 S.Ct. 1129. It explained: \"The reception and rechanneling of [broadcast television signals] for simultaneous viewing is essentially a viewer function, irrespective of the distance between the broadcasting station and the ultimate viewer.\" Id., at 408, 94 S.Ct. 1129.\n\nThe Court also recognized that the CATV system exercised some measure of choice over what to transmit. But that fact did not transform the CATV system into a broadcaster. A broadcaster exercises significant creativity in choosing what to air, the Court reasoned. Id., at 410, 94 S.Ct. 1129. In contrast, the CATV provider makes an initial choice about which broadcast stations to retransmit, but then \"`simply carr[ies], without editing, whatever programs [it] receive[s].'\" Ibid. (quoting Fortnightly, supra, at 400, 88 S.Ct. 2084 (alterations in original)).\n\nB\n\nIn 1976 Congress amended the Copyright Act in large part to reject the Court's holdings in Fortnightly and Teleprompter. See H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476, pp. 86-87 (1976) (hereinafter H.R. Rep.) (The 1976 amendments \"completely overturned\" this Court's narrow construction of the Act in Fortnightly and Teleprompter). Congress enacted new language that erased the Court's line between broadcaster and viewer, in respect to \"perform[ing]\" a work. The amended statute clarifies that to \"perform\" an audiovisual work means \"to show its images in any sequence or to 2506*2506 make the sounds accompanying it audible.\" \u00a7 101; see ibid. (defining \"[a]udiovisual works\" as \"works that consist of a series of related images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines..., together with accompanying sounds\"). Under this new language, both the broadcaster and the viewer of a television program \"perform,\" because they both show the program's images and make audible the program's sounds. See H.R. Rep., at 63 (\"[A] broadcasting network is performing when it transmits [a singer's performance of a song] ... and any individual is performing whenever he or she ... communicates the performance by turning on a receiving set\").\n\nCongress also enacted the Transmit Clause, which specifies that an entity performs publicly when it \"transmit[s] ... a performance ... to the public.\" \u00a7 101; see ibid. (defining \"[t]o `transmit' a performance\" as \"to communicate it by any device or process whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they are sent\"). Cable system activities, like those of the CATV systems in Fortnightly and Teleprompter, lie at the heart of the activities that Congress intended this language to cover. See H.R. Rep., at 63 (\"[A] cable television system is performing when it retransmits [a network] broadcast to its subscribers\"); see also ibid. (\"[T]he concep[t] of public performance ... cover[s] not only the initial rendition or showing, but also any further act by which that rendition or showing is transmitted or communicated to the public\"). The Clause thus makes clear that an entity that acts like a CATV system itself performs, even if when doing so, it simply enhances viewers' ability to receive broadcast television signals.\n\nCongress further created a new section of the Act to regulate cable companies' public performances of copyrighted works. See \u00a7 111. Section 111 creates a complex, highly detailed compulsory licensing scheme that sets out the conditions, including the payment of compulsory fees, under which cable systems may retransmit broadcasts. H.R. Rep., at 88 (Section 111 is primarily \"directed at the operation of cable television systems and the terms and conditions of their liability for the retransmission of copyrighted works\").\n\nCongress made these three changes to achieve a similar end: to bring the activities of cable systems within the scope of the Copyright Act.\n\nC\n\nThis history makes clear that Aereo is not simply an equipment provider. Rather, Aereo, and not just its subscribers, \"perform[s]\" (or \"transmit[s]\"). Aereo's activities are substantially similar to those of the CATV companies that Congress amended the Act to reach. See id., at 89 (\"[C]able systems are commercial enterprises whose basic retransmission operations are based on the carriage of copyrighted program material\"). Aereo sells a service that allows subscribers to watch television programs, many of which are copyrighted, almost as they are being broadcast. In providing this service, Aereo uses its own equipment, housed in a centralized warehouse, outside of its users' homes. By means of its technology (antennas, transcoders, and servers), Aereo's system \"receive[s] programs that have been released to the public and carr[ies] them by private channels to additional viewers.\" Fortnightly, 392 U.S., at 400, 88 S.Ct. 2084. It \"carr[ies] ... whatever programs [it] receive[s],\" and it offers \"all the programming\" of each over-the-air station it carries. Id., at 392, 400, 88 S.Ct. 2084.\n\nAereo's equipment may serve a \"viewer function\"; it may enhance the viewer's ability to receive a broadcaster's programs. 2507*2507 It may even emulate equipment a viewer could use at home. But the same was true of the equipment that was before the Court, and ultimately before Congress, in Fortnightly and Teleprompter.\n\nWe recognize, and Aereo and the dissent emphasize, one particular difference between Aereo's system and the cable systems at issue in Fortnightly and Teleprompter. The systems in those cases transmitted constantly; they sent continuous programming to each subscriber's television set. In contrast, Aereo's system remains inert until a subscriber indicates that she wants to watch a program. Only at that moment, in automatic response to the subscriber's request, does Aereo's system activate an antenna and begin to transmit the requested program.\n\nThis is a critical difference, says the dissent. It means that Aereo's subscribers, not Aereo, \"selec[t] the copyrighted content\" that is \"perform[ed],\" post, at 2513 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), and for that reason they, not Aereo, \"transmit\" the performance. Aereo is thus like \"a copy shop that provides its patrons with a library card.\" Post, at 2514. A copy shop is not directly liable whenever a patron uses the shop's machines to \"reproduce\" copyrighted materials found in that library. See \u00a7 106(1) (\"exclusive righ[t] ... to reproduce the copyrighted work\"). And by the same token, Aereo should not be directly liable whenever its patrons use its equipment to \"transmit\" copyrighted television programs to their screens.\n\nIn our view, however, the dissent's copy shop argument, in whatever form, makes too much out of too little. Given Aereo's overwhelming likeness to the cable companies targeted by the 1976 amendments, this sole technological difference between Aereo and traditional cable companies does not make a critical difference here. The subscribers of the Fortnightly and Teleprompter cable systems also selected what programs to display on their receiving sets. Indeed, as we explained in Fortnightly, such a subscriber \"could choose any of the ... programs he wished to view by simply turning the knob on his own television set.\" 392 U.S., at 392, 88 S.Ct. 2084. The same is true of an Aereo subscriber. Of course, in Fortnightly the television signals, in a sense, lurked behind the screen, ready to emerge when the subscriber turned the knob. Here the signals pursue their ordinary course of travel through the universe until today's \"turn of the knob\" \u2014 a click on a website \u2014 activates machinery that intercepts and reroutes them to Aereo's subscribers over the Internet. But this difference means nothing to the subscriber. It means nothing to the broadcaster. We do not see how this single difference, invisible to subscriber and broadcaster alike, could transform a system that is for all practical purposes a traditional cable system into \"a copy shop that provides its patrons with a library card.\"\n\nIn other cases involving different kinds of service or technology providers, a user's involvement in the operation of the provider's equipment and selection of the content transmitted may well bear on whether the provider performs within the meaning of the Act. But the many similarities between Aereo and cable companies, considered in light of Congress' basic purposes in amending the Copyright Act, convince us that this difference is not critical here. We conclude that Aereo is not just an equipment supplier and that Aereo \"perform[s].\"\n\nIII\n\nNext, we must consider whether Aereo performs petitioners' works \"publicly,\" within the meaning of the Transmit Clause. Under the Clause, an entity performs 2508*2508 a work publicly when it \"transmit[s]... a performance ... of the work ... to the public.\" \u00a7 101. Aereo denies that it satisfies this definition. It reasons as follows: First, the \"performance\" it \"transmit[s]\" is the performance created by its act of transmitting. And second, because each of these performances is capable of being received by one and only one subscriber, Aereo transmits privately, not publicly. Even assuming Aereo's first argument is correct, its second does not follow.\n\nWe begin with Aereo's first argument. What performance does Aereo transmit? Under the Act, \"[t]o `transmit' a performance... is to communicate it by any device or process whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place from which they are sent.\" Ibid. And \"[t]o `perform'\" an audiovisual work means \"to show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.\" Ibid.\n\nPetitioners say Aereo transmits a prior performance of their works. Thus when Aereo retransmits a network's prior broadcast, the underlying broadcast (itself a performance) is the performance that Aereo transmits. Aereo, as discussed above, says the performance it transmits is the new performance created by its act of transmitting. That performance comes into existence when Aereo streams the sounds and images of a broadcast program to a subscriber's screen.\n\nWe assume arguendo that Aereo's first argument is correct. Thus, for present purposes, to transmit a performance of (at least) an audiovisual work means to communicate contemporaneously visible images and contemporaneously audible sounds of the work. Cf. United States v. American Soc. of Composers, Authors and Publishers, 627 F.3d 64, 73 (C.A.2 2010) (holding that a download of a work is not a performance because the data transmitted are not \"contemporaneously perceptible\"). When an Aereo subscriber selects a program to watch, Aereo streams the program over the Internet to that subscriber. Aereo thereby \"communicate[s]\" to the subscriber, by means of a \"device or process,\" the work's images and sounds. \u00a7 101. And those images and sounds are contemporaneously visible and audible on the subscriber's computer (or other Internet-connected device). So under our assumed definition, Aereo transmits a performance whenever its subscribers watch a program.\n\nBut what about the Clause's further requirement that Aereo transmit a performance \"to the public\"? As we have said, an Aereo subscriber receives broadcast television signals with an antenna dedicated to him alone. Aereo's system makes from those signals a personal copy of the selected program. It streams the content of the copy to the same subscriber and to no one else. One and only one subscriber has the ability to see and hear each Aereo transmission. The fact that each transmission is to only one subscriber, in Aereo's view, means that it does not transmit a performance \"to the public.\"\n\nIn terms of the Act's purposes, these differences do not distinguish Aereo's system from cable systems, which do perform \"publicly.\" Viewed in terms of Congress' regulatory objectives, why should any of these technological differences matter? They concern the behind-the-scenes way in which Aereo delivers television programming to its viewers' screens. They do not render Aereo's commercial objective any different from that of cable companies. Nor do they significantly alter the viewing experience of Aereo's subscribers. Why would a subscriber who wishes to watch a television show care much whether images and sounds are delivered to his screen via a large multisubscriber antenna or one 2509*2509 small dedicated antenna, whether they arrive instantaneously or after a few seconds' delay, or whether they are transmitted directly or after a personal copy is made? And why, if Aereo is right, could not modern CATV systems simply continue the same commercial and consumer-oriented activities, free of copyright restrictions, provided they substitute such new technologies for old? Congress would as much have intended to protect a copyright holder from the unlicensed activities of Aereo as from those of cable companies.\n\nThe text of the Clause effectuates Congress' intent. Aereo's argument to the contrary relies on the premise that \"to transmit ... a performance\" means to make a single transmission. But the Clause suggests that an entity may transmit a performance through multiple, discrete transmissions. That is because one can \"transmit\" or \"communicate\" something through a set of actions. Thus one can transmit a message to one's friends, irrespective of whether one sends separate identical e-mails to each friend or a single e-mail to all at once. So can an elected official communicate an idea, slogan, or speech to her constituents, regardless of whether she communicates that idea, slogan, or speech during individual phone calls to each constituent or in a public square.\n\nThe fact that a singular noun (\"a performance\") follows the words \"to transmit\" does not suggest the contrary. One can sing a song to his family, whether he sings the same song one-on-one or in front of all together. Similarly, one's colleagues may watch a performance of a particular play \u2014 say, this season's modern-dress version of \"Measure for Measure\" \u2014 whether they do so at separate or at the same showings. By the same principle, an entity may transmit a performance through one or several transmissions, where the performance is of the same work.\n\nThe Transmit Clause must permit this interpretation, for it provides that one may transmit a performance to the public \"whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance ... receive it ... at the same time or at different times.\" \u00a7 101. Were the words \"to transmit ... a performance\" limited to a single act of communication, members of the public could not receive the performance communicated \"at different times.\" Therefore, in light of the purpose and text of the Clause, we conclude that when an entity communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to multiple people, it transmits a performance to them regardless of the number of discrete communications it makes.\n\nWe do not see how the fact that Aereo transmits via personal copies of programs could make a difference. The Act applies to transmissions \"by means of any device or process.\" Ibid. And retransmitting a television program using user-specific copies is a \"process\" of transmitting a performance. A \"cop[y]\" of a work is simply a \"material objec[t] ... in which a work is fixed ... and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated.\" Ibid. So whether Aereo transmits from the same or separate copies, it performs the same work; it shows the same images and makes audible the same sounds. Therefore, when Aereo streams the same television program to multiple subscribers, it \"transmit[s] ... a performance\" to all of them.\n\nMoreover, the subscribers to whom Aereo transmits television programs constitute \"the public.\" Aereo communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to a large number of people who are unrelated and unknown to each other. This matters because, although 2510*2510 the Act does not define \"the public,\" it specifies that an entity performs publicly when it performs at \"any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered.\" Ibid. The Act thereby suggests that \"the public\" consists of a large group of people outside of a family and friends.\n\nNeither the record nor Aereo suggests that Aereo's subscribers receive performances in their capacities as owners or possessors of the underlying works. This is relevant because when an entity performs to a set of people, whether they constitute \"the public\" often depends upon their relationship to the underlying work. When, for example, a valet parking attendant returns cars to their drivers, we would not say that the parking service provides cars \"to the public.\" We would say that it provides the cars to their owners. We would say that a car dealership, on the other hand, does provide cars to the public, for it sells cars to individuals who lack a pre-existing relationship to the cars. Similarly, an entity that transmits a performance to individuals in their capacities as owners or possessors does not perform to \"the public,\" whereas an entity like Aereo that transmits to large numbers of paying subscribers who lack any prior relationship to the works does so perform.\n\nFinally, we note that Aereo's subscribers may receive the same programs at different times and locations. This fact does not help Aereo, however, for the Transmit Clause expressly provides that an entity may perform publicly \"whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance ... receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.\" Ibid. In other words, \"the public\" need not be situated together, spatially or temporally. For these reasons, we conclude that Aereo transmits a performance of petitioners' copyrighted works to the public, within the meaning of the Transmit Clause.\n\nIV\n\nAereo and many of its supporting amici argue that to apply the Transmit Clause to Aereo's conduct will impose copyright liability on other technologies, including new technologies, that Congress could not possibly have wanted to reach. We agree that Congress, while intending the Transmit Clause to apply broadly to cable companies and their equivalents, did not intend to discourage or to control the emergence or use of different kinds of technologies. But we do not believe that our limited holding today will have that effect.\n\nFor one thing, the history of cable broadcast transmissions that led to the enactment of the Transmit Clause informs our conclusion that Aereo \"perform[s],\" but it does not determine whether different kinds of providers in different contexts also \"perform.\" For another, an entity only transmits a performance when it communicates contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds of a work. See Brief for Respondent 31 (\"[I]f a distributor ... sells [multiple copies of a digital video disc] by mail to consumers, ... [its] distribution of the DVDs merely makes it possible for the recipients to perform the work themselves \u2014 it is not a `device or process' by which the distributor publicly performs the work\" (emphasis in original)).\n\nFurther, we have interpreted the term \"the public\" to apply to a group of individuals acting as ordinary members of the public who pay primarily to watch broadcast television programs, many of which are copyrighted. We have said that it does not extend to those who act as owners or possessors of the relevant product. 2511*2511 And we have not considered whether the public performance right is infringed when the user of a service pays primarily for something other than the transmission of copyrighted works, such as the remote storage of content. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31 (distinguishing cloud-based storage services because they \"offer consumers more numerous and convenient means of playing back copies that the consumers have already lawfully acquired\" (emphasis in original)). In addition, an entity does not transmit to the public if it does not transmit to a substantial number of people outside of a family and its social circle.\n\nWe also note that courts often apply a statute's highly general language in light of the statute's basic purposes. Finally, the doctrine of \"fair use\" can help to prevent inappropriate or inequitable applications of the Clause. See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984).\n\nWe cannot now answer more precisely how the Transmit Clause or other provisions of the Copyright Act will apply to technologies not before us. We agree with the Solicitor General that \"[q]uestions involving cloud computing, [remote storage] DVRs, and other novel issues not before the Court, as to which `Congress has not plainly marked [the] course,' should await a case in which they are squarely presented.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 34 (quoting Sony, supra, at 431, 104 S.Ct. 774 (alteration in original)). And we note that, to the extent commercial actors or other interested entities may be concerned with the relationship between the development and use of such technologies and the Copyright Act, they are of course free to seek action from Congress. Cf. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512.\n\n* * *\n\nIn sum, having considered the details of Aereo's practices, we find them highly similar to those of the CATV systems in Fortnightly and Teleprompter. And those are activities that the 1976 amendments sought to bring within the scope of the Copyright Act. Insofar as there are differences, those differences concern not the nature of the service that Aereo provides so much as the technological manner in which it provides the service. We conclude that those differences are not adequate to place Aereo's activities outside the scope of the Act.\n\nFor these reasons, we conclude that Aereo \"perform[s]\" petitioners' copyrighted works \"publicly,\" as those terms are defined by the Transmit Clause. We therefore reverse the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\nJustice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMAS and Justice ALITO join, dissenting.\n\nThis case is the latest skirmish in the long-running copyright battle over the delivery of television program-ming. Petitioners, a collection of television networks and affiliates (Networks), broadcast copyrighted programs on the public airwaves for all to see. Aereo, respondent, operates an automated system that allows subscribers to receive, on Internet-connected devices, programs that they select, including the Networks' copyrighted programs. The Networks sued Aereo for several forms of copyright infringement, but we are here concerned with a single claim: that Aereo violates the Networks'\"exclusive righ[t]\" to \"perform\" their programs 2512*2512 \"publicly.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(4). That claim fails at the very outset because Aereo does not \"perform\" at all. The Court manages to reach the opposite conclusion only by disregarding widely accepted rules for service-provider liability and adopting in their place an improvised standard (\"looks-like-cable-TV\") that will sow confusion for years to come.\n\nI. Legal Standard\n\nThere are two types of liability for copyright infringement: direct and secondary. As its name suggests, the former applies when an actor personally engages in infringing conduct. See Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984). Secondary liability, by contrast, is a means of holding defendants responsible for infringement by third parties, even when the defendants \"have not themselves engaged in the infringing activity.\" Id., at 435, 104 S.Ct. 774. It applies when a defendant \"intentionally induc[es] or encourag[es]\" infringing acts by others or profits from such acts \"while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit [them].\" Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 930, 125 S.Ct. 2764, 162 L.Ed.2d 781 (2005).\n\nMost suits against equipment manufacturers and service providers involve secondary-liability claims. For example, when movie studios sued to block the sale of Sony's Betamax videocassette recorder (VCR), they argued that Sony was liable because its customers were making unauthorized copies. See Sony, supra, at 434-435, 104 S.Ct. 774. Record labels and movie studios relied on a similar theory when they sued Grokster and StreamCast, two providers of peer-to-peer file-sharing software. See Grokster, supra, at 920-921, 927, 125 S.Ct. 2764.\n\nThis suit, or rather the portion of it before us here, is fundamentally different. The Networks claim that Aereo directly infringes their public-performance right. Accordingly, the Networks must prove that Aereo \"perform[s]\" copyrighted works, \u00a7 106(4), when its subscribers log in, select a channel, and push the \"watch\" button. That process undoubtedly results in a performance; the question is who does the performing. See Cartoon Network LP, LLLP v. CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F.3d 121, 130 (C.A.2 2008). If Aereo's subscribers perform but Aereo does not, the claim necessarily fails.\n\nThe Networks' claim is governed by a simple but profoundly important rule: A defendant may be held directly liable only if it has engaged in volitional conduct that violates the Act. See 3 W. Patry, Copyright \u00a7 9:5.50 (2013). This requirement is firmly grounded in the Act's text, which defines \"perform\" in active, affirmative terms: One \"perform[s]\" a copyrighted \"audiovisual work,\" such as a movie or news broadcast, by \"show[ing] its images in any sequence\" or \"mak[ing] the sounds accompanying it audible.\" \u00a7 101. And since the Act makes it unlawful to copy or perform copyrighted works, not to copy or perform in general, see \u00a7 501(a), the volitional-act requirement demands conduct directed to the plaintiff's copyrighted material, see Sony, supra, at 434, 104 S.Ct. 774. Every Court of Appeals to have considered an automated-service provider's direct liability for copyright infringement has adopted that rule. See Fox Broadcasting Co. v. Dish Network LLC, 747 F.3d 1060, 1066-1068 (C.A.9 2014); Cartoon Network, supra, at 130-131 (C.A.2 2008); CoStar Group, Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc., 373 F.3d 544, 549-550 (C.A.4 2004).[bookmark: r[1]][1] 2513*2513 Although we have not opined on the issue, our cases are fully consistent with a volitional-conduct requirement. For example, we gave several examples of direct infringement in Sony, each of which involved a volitional act directed to the plaintiff's copyrighted material. See 464 U.S., at 437, n. 18, 104 S.Ct. 774.\n\nThe volitional-conduct requirement is not at issue in most direct-infringement cases; the usual point of dispute is whether the defendant's conduct is infringing (e.g., Does the defendant's design copy the plaintiff's?), rather than whether the defendant has acted at all (e.g., Did this defendant create the infringing design?). But it comes right to the fore when a direct-infringement claim is lodged against a defendant who does nothing more than operate an automated, user-controlled system. See, e.g., Fox Broadcasting, supra, at 1067; Cartoon Network, supra, at 131. Internet-service providers are a prime example. When one user sends data to another, the provider's equipment facilitates the transfer automatically. Does that mean that the provider is directly liable when the transmission happens to result in the \"reproduc[tion],\" \u00a7 106(1), of a copyrighted work? It does not. The provider's system is \"totally indifferent to the material's content,\" whereas courts require \"some aspect of volition\" directed at the copyrighted material before direct liability may be imposed. CoStar, 373 F.3d, at 550-551.[bookmark: r[2]][2] The defendant may be held directly liable only if the defendant itself \"trespassed on the exclusive domain of the copyright owner.\" Id., at 550. Most of the time that issue will come down to who selects the copyrighted content: the defendant or its customers. See Cartoon Network, supra, at 131-132.\n\nA comparison between copy shops and video-on-demand services illustrates the point. A copy shop rents out photocopiers on a per-use basis. One customer might copy his 10-year-old's drawings \u2014 a perfectly lawful thing to do \u2014 while another might duplicate a famous artist's copyrighted photographs \u2014 a use clearly prohibited by \u00a7 106(1). Either way, the customer chooses the content and activates the copying function; the photocopier does nothing except in response to the customer's commands. Because the shop plays no role in selecting the content, it cannot be held directly liable when a customer makes an infringing copy. See CoStar, supra, at 550.\n\nVideo-on-demand services, like photocopiers, respond automatically to user input, but they differ in one crucial respect: They choose the content. When a user signs in to Netflix, for example, \"thousands of ... movies [and] TV episodes\" carefully curated by Netflix are \"available to watch instantly.\" See How [D]oes Netflix [W]ork?, online at http://help.netflix.com/ en/node/412 (as visited June 20, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). That selection and arrangement by the service provider constitutes a volitional act directed to specific copyrighted works and thus serves as a basis for direct liability.\n\n2514*2514 The distinction between direct and secondary liability would collapse if there were not a clear rule for determining whether the defendant committed the infringing act. See Cartoon Network, 536 F.3d, at 132-133. The volitional-conduct requirement supplies that rule; its purpose is not to excuse defendants from accountability, but to channel the claims against them into the correct analytical track. See Brief for 36 Intellectual Property and Copyright Law Professors as Amici Curiae 7. Thus, in the example given above, the fact that the copy shop does not choose the content simply means that its culpability will be assessed using secondary-liability rules rather than direct-liability rules. See Sony, supra, at 434-442, 104 S.Ct. 774; Cartoon Network, supra, at 132-133.\n\nII. Application to Aereo\n\nSo which is Aereo: the copy shop or the video-on-demand service? In truth, it is neither. Rather, it is akin to a copy shop that provides its patrons with a library card. Aereo offers access to an automated system consisting of routers, servers, transcoders, and dime-sized antennae. Like a photocopier or VCR, that system lies dormant until a subscriber activates it. When a subscriber selects a program, Aereo's system picks up the relevant broadcast signal, translates its audio and video components into digital data, stores the data in a user-specific file, and transmits that file's contents to the subscriber via the Internet \u2014 at which point the subscriber's laptop, tablet, or other device displays the broadcast just as an ordinary television would. The result of that process fits the statutory definition of a performance to a tee: The subscriber's device \"show[s]\" the broadcast's \"images\" and \"make[s] the sounds accompanying\" the broadcast \"audible.\" \u00a7 101. The only question is whether those performances are the product of Aereo's volitional conduct.\n\nThey are not. Unlike video-on-demand services, Aereo does not provide a prearranged assortment of movies and television shows. Rather, it assigns each subscriber an antenna that \u2014 like a library card \u2014 can be used to obtain whatever broadcasts are freely available. Some of those broadcasts are copyrighted; others are in the public domain. The key point is that subscribers call all the shots: Aereo's automated system does not relay any program, copyrighted or not, until a subscriber selects the program and tells Aereo to relay it. Aereo's operation of that system is a volitional act and a but-for cause of the resulting performances, but, as in the case of the copy shop, that degree of involvement is not enough for direct liability. See Grokster, 545 U.S., at 960, 125 S.Ct. 2764 (BREYER, J., concurring) (\"[T]he producer of a technology which permits unlawful copying does not himself engage in unlawful copying\").\n\nIn sum, Aereo does not \"perform\" for the sole and simple reason that it does not make the choice of content. And because Aereo does not perform, it cannot be held directly liable for infringing the Networks' public-performance right.[bookmark: r[3]][3] That conclusion does not necessarily mean that Aereo's service complies with the Copyright Act. Quite the contrary. The Networks' complaint alleges that Aereo is directly and secondarily liable for infringing their public-performance rights (\u00a7 106(4)) and also their reproduction rights (\u00a7 106(1)). Their request for a preliminary injunction \u2014 the only issue before this Court \u2014 is based exclusively on the direct-liability portion of the public-performance claim 2515*2515 (and further limited to Aereo's \"watch\" function, as opposed to its \"record\" function). See App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a-61a. Affirming the judgment below would merely return this case to the lower courts for consideration of the Networks' remaining claims.\n\nIII. Guilt By Resemblance\n\nThe Court's conclusion that Aereo performs boils down to the following syllogism: (1) Congress amended the Act to overrule our decisions holding that cable systems do not perform when they retransmit over-the-air broadcasts;[bookmark: r[4]][4] (2) Aereo looks a lot like a cable system; therefore (3) Aereo performs. Ante, at 2504-2507. That reasoning suffers from a trio of defects.\n\nFirst, it is built on the shakiest of foundations. Perceiving the text to be ambiguous, ante, at 2504, the Court reaches out to decide the case based on a few isolated snippets of legislative history, ante, at 2505-2506 (citing H.R.Rep. No. 94-1476 (1976)). The Court treats those snippets as authoritative evidence of congressional intent even though they come from a single report issued by a committee whose members make up a small fraction of one of the two Houses of Congress. Little else need be said here about the severe shortcomings of that interpretative methodology. See Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571 U.S. ___, ___, 134 S.Ct. 1158, 1176-1177, 188 L.Ed.2d 158 (2014) (SCALIA, J., concurring in principal part and concurring in judgment).\n\nSecond, the Court's reasoning fails on its own terms because there are material differences between the cable systems at issue in Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U.S. 394, 94 S.Ct. 1129, 39 L.Ed.2d 415 (1974), and Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 U.S. 390, 88 S.Ct. 2084, 20 L.Ed.2d 1176 (1968), on the one hand and Aereo on the other. The former (which were then known as community-antenna television systems) captured the full range of broadcast signals and forwarded them to all subscribers at all times, whereas Aereo transmits only specific programs selected by the user, at specific times selected by the user. The Court acknowledges this distinction but blithely concludes that it \"does not make a critical difference.\" Ante, at 2507. Even if that were true, the Court fails to account for other salient differences between the two technologies.[bookmark: r[5]][5] Though cable systems started out essentially as dumb pipes that routed signals from point A to point B, see ante, at 2504, by the 1970's, that kind of service \"`no longer exist[ed],'\" Brief for Petitioners in Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Teleprompter Corp., O.T. 1973, No. 72-1633, p. 22. At the time of our Teleprompter decision, cable companies \"perform[ed] the same functions as `broadcasters' by deliberately selecting and importing distant signals, originating programs, [and] selling commercials,\" 2516*2516 id., at 20, thus making them curators of content \u2014 more akin to video-on-demand services than copy shops. So far as the record reveals, Aereo does none of those things.\n\nThird, and most importantly, even accepting that the 1976 amendments had as their purpose the overruling of our cable-TV cases, what they were meant to do and how they did it are two different questions \u2014 and it is the latter that governs the case before us here. The injury claimed is not violation of a law that says operations similar to cable TV are subject to copyright liability, but violation of \u00a7 106(4) of the Copyright Act. And whatever soothing reasoning the Court uses to reach its result (\"this looks like cable TV\"), the consequence of its holding is that someone who implements this technology \"perform[s]\" under that provision. That greatly disrupts settled jurisprudence which, before today, applied the straightforward, bright-line test of volitional conduct directed at the copyrighted work. If that test is not outcome determinative in this case, presumably it is not outcome determinative elsewhere as well. And it is not clear what the Court proposes to replace it. Perhaps the Court means to adopt (invent, really) a two-tier version of the Copyright Act, one part of which applies to \"cable companies and their equivalents\" while the other governs everyone else. Ante, at 2506-2507, 2510.\n\nThe rationale for the Court's ad hoc rule for cable-system lookalikes is so broad that it renders nearly a third of the Court's opinion superfluous. Part II of the opinion concludes that Aereo performs because it resembles a cable company, and Congress amended the Act in 1976 \"to bring the activities of cable systems within [its] scope.\" Ante, at 2506. Part III of the opinion purports to address separately the question whether Aereo performs \"publicly.\" Ante, at 2507-2510. Trouble is, that question cannot remain open if Congress's supposed intent to regulate whatever looks like a cable company must be given legal effect (as the Court says in Part II). The Act reaches only public performances, see \u00a7 106(4), so Congress could not have regulated \"the activities of cable systems\" without deeming their retransmissions public performances. The upshot is this: If Aereo's similarity to a cable company means that it performs, then by necessity that same characteristic means that it does so publicly, and Part III of the Court's opinion discusses an issue that is no longer relevant \u2014 though discussing it certainly gives the opinion the \"feel\" of real textual analysis.\n\nMaking matters worse, the Court provides no criteria for determining when its cable-TV-lookalike rule applies. Must a defendant offer access to live television to qualify? If similarity to cable-television service is the measure, then the answer must be yes. But consider the implications of that answer: Aereo would be free to do exactly what it is doing right now so long as it built mandatory time shifting into its \"watch\" function.[bookmark: r[6]][6] Aereo would not be providing live television if it made subscribers wait to tune in until after a show's live broadcast ended. A subscriber could watch the 7 p.m. airing of a 1-hour program any time after 8 p.m. Assuming the Court does not intend to adopt such a do-nothing rule (though it very well may), there must be some other means of identifying 2517*2517 who is and is not subject to its guilt-by-resemblance regime.\n\nTwo other criteria come to mind. One would cover any automated service that captures and stores live television broadcasts at a user's direction. That can't be right, since it is exactly what remote storage digital video recorders (RS-DVRs) do, see Cartoon Network, 536 F.3d, at 124-125, and the Court insists that its \"limited holding\" does not decide the fate of those devices, ante, at 2510-2511. The other potential benchmark is the one offered by the Government: The cable-TV-lookalike rule embraces any entity that \"operates an integrated system, substantially dependent on physical equipment that is used in common by [its] subscribers.\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20. The Court sensibly avoids that approach because it would sweep in Internet service providers and a host of other entities that quite obviously do not perform.\n\nThat leaves as the criterion of cable-TV-resemblance nothing but th'ol' totality-of-the-circumstances test (which is not a test at all but merely assertion of an intent to perform test-free, ad hoc, case-by-case evaluation). It will take years, perhaps decades, to determine which automated systems now in existence are governed by the traditional volitional-conduct test and which get the Aereo treatment. (And automated systems now in contemplation will have to take their chances.) The Court vows that its ruling will not affect cloud-storage providers and cable-television systems, see ante, at 2510-2511, but it cannot deliver on that promise given the imprecision of its result-driven rule. Indeed, the difficulties inherent in the Court's makeshift approach will become apparent in this very case. Today's decision addresses the legality of Aereo's \"watch\" function, which provides nearly contemporaneous access to live broadcasts. On remand, one of the first questions the lower courts will face is whether Aereo's \"record\" function, which allows subscribers to save a program while it is airing and watch it later, infringes the Networks' public-performance right. The volitional-conduct rule provides a clear answer to that question: Because Aereo does not select the programs viewed by its users, it does not perform. But it is impossible to say how the issue will come out under the Court's analysis, since cable companies did not offer remote recording and playback services when Congress amended the Copyright Act in 1976.\n\n* * *\n\nI share the Court's evident feeling that what Aereo is doing (or enabling to be done) to the Networks' copyrighted programming ought not to be allowed. But perhaps we need not distort the Copyright Act to forbid it. As discussed at the outset, Aereo's secondary liability for performance infringement is yet to be determined, as is its primary and secondary liability for reproduction infringement. If that does not suffice, then (assuming one shares the majority's estimation of right and wrong) what we have before us must be considered a \"loophole\" in the law. It is not the role of this Court to identify and plug loopholes. It is the role of good lawyers to identify and exploit them, and the role of Congress to eliminate them if it wishes. Congress can do that, I may add, in a much more targeted, better informed, and less disruptive fashion than the crude \"looks-like-cable-TV\" solution the Court invents today.\n\nWe came within one vote of declaring the VCR contraband 30 years ago in Sony. See 464 U.S., at 441, n. 21, 104 S.Ct. 774. The dissent in that case was driven in part by the plaintiffs' prediction that VCR technology would wreak all manner of havoc in the television and movie industries. See id., at 483, 104 S.Ct. 774 (opinion of Blackmun, 2518*2518 J.); see also Brief for CBS, Inc., as Amicus Curiae, O.T. 1982, No. 81-1687, p. 2 (arguing that VCRs \"directly threatened\" the bottom line of \"[e]very broadcaster\").\n\nThe Networks make similarly dire predictions about Aereo. We are told that nothing less than \"the very existence of broadcast television as we know it\" is at stake. Brief for Petitioners 39. Aereo and its amici dispute those forecasts and make a few of their own, suggesting that a decision in the Networks' favor will stifle technological innovation and imperil billions of dollars of investments in cloud-storage services. See Brief for Respondents 48-51; Brief for BSA, The Software Alliance as Amicus Curiae 5-13. We are in no position to judge the validity of those self-interested claims or to foresee the path of future technological development. See Sony, supra, at 430-431, 104 S.Ct. 774; see also Grokster, 545 U.S., at 958, 125 S.Ct. 2764 (BREYER, J., concurring). Hence, the proper course is not to bend and twist the Act's terms in an effort to produce a just outcome, but to apply the law as it stands and leave to Congress the task of deciding whether the Copyright Act needs an upgrade. I conclude, as the Court concluded in Sony: \"It may well be that Congress will take a fresh look at this new technology, just as it so often has examined other innovations in the past. But it is not our job to apply laws that have not yet been written. Applying the copyright statute, as it now reads, to the facts as they have been developed in this case, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be [affirmed].\" 464 U.S., at 456, 104 S.Ct. 774.\n\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n[bookmark: [1]][1]  An unpublished decision of the Third Circuit is to the same effect. Parker v. Google, Inc., 242 Fed.Appx. 833, 836-837 (2007) (per curiam).\n\nThe Networks muster only one case they say stands for a different approach, New York Times Co. v. Tasini, 533 U.S. 483, 121 S.Ct. 2381, 150 L.Ed.2d 500 (2001). Reply Brief 18. But Tasini is clearly inapposite; it dealt with the question whether the defendants' copying was permissible, not whether the defendants were the ones who made the copies. See 533 U.S., at 487-488, 492, 504-506, 121 S.Ct. 2381.\n\n[bookmark: [2]][2]  Congress has enacted several safe-harbor provisions applicable to automated network processes, see, e.g., 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(a)-(b), but those provisions do not foreclose \"any other defense,\" \u00a7 512(l), including a volitional-conduct defense.\n\n[bookmark: [3]][3]  Because I conclude that Aereo does not perform at all, I do not reach the question whether the performances in this case are to the public. See ante, at 2507-2511.\n\n[bookmark: [4]][4]  See Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U.S. 394, 94 S.Ct. 1129, 39 L.Ed.2d 415 (1974); Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 U.S. 390, 88 S.Ct. 2084, 20 L.Ed.2d 1176 (1968).\n\n[bookmark: [5]][5]  The Court observes that \"[t]he subscribers of the Fortnightly and Teleprompter cable systems... selected what programs to display on their receiving sets,\" but acknowledges that those choices were possible only because \"the television signals, in a sense, lurked behind the screen, ready to emerge when the subscriber turned the knob.\" Ante, at 2507. The latter point is dispositive: The signals were \"ready to emerge\" because the cable system \u2014 much like a video-on-demand provider \u2014 took affirmative, volitional steps to put them there. As discussed above, the same cannot be said of the programs available through Aereo's automated system.\n\n[bookmark: [6]][6]  Broadcasts accessible through the \"watch\" function are technically not live because Aereo's servers take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to begin transmitting data to a subscriber's device.

(\"Apple\").\n\nA jury found that Samsung infringed Apple's design and utility patents and diluted Apple's trade dresses. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the jury's verdict on the design patent infringements, the validity of two utility patent claims, and the damages awarded for the design and utility patent infringements appealed by Samsung. However, we reverse the jury's findings that the asserted trade dresses are protectable. We therefore vacate the jury's damages awards against the Samsung products that were found liable for trade dress dilution and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nApple sued Samsung in April 2011. On August 24, 2012, the first jury reached a verdict that numerous Samsung smartphones infringed and diluted Apple's patents and trade dresses in various combinations and awarded over $1 billion in damages.\n\nThe infringed design patents are U.S. Design Patent Nos. D618,677 (\"D'677 patent\"), D593,087 (\"D'087 patent\"), and D604,305 (\"D'305 patent\"), which claim certain design elements embodied in Apple's iPhone. The infringed utility patents are U.S. Patent Nos. 7,469,381 (\"'381 patent\"), 7,844,915 (\"'915 patent\"), and 7,864,163 (\"'163 patent\"), which claim certain features in the iPhone's user interface. The diluted trade dresses are Trademark Registration No. 3,470,983 (\"'983 trade dress\") and an unregistered trade dress 990*990 defined in terms of certain elements in the configuration of the iPhone.\n\nFollowing the first jury trial, the district court upheld the jury's infringement, dilution, and validity findings over Samsung's post-trial motion. The district court also upheld $639,403,248 in damages, but ordered a partial retrial on the remainder of the damages because they had been awarded for a period when Samsung lacked notice of some of the asserted patents. The jury in the partial retrial on damages awarded Apple $290,456,793, which the district court upheld over Samsung's second post-trial motion. On March 6, 2014, the district court entered a final judgment in favor of Apple, and Samsung filed a notice of appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe review the denial of Samsung's post-trial motions under the Ninth Circuit's procedural standards. See Revolution Eyewear, Inc. v. Aspex Eyewear, Inc., 563 F.3d 1358, 1370-71 (Fed.Cir. 2009). The Ninth Circuit reviews de novo a denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law. Id. \"The test is whether the evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, permits only one reasonable conclusion, and that conclusion is contrary to that of the jury.\" Id. (citing Theme Promotions, Inc. v. News Am. Mktg. FSI, 546 F.3d 991, 999 (9th Cir.2008)).\n\nThe Ninth Circuit reviews a denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion. Revolution Eyewear, 563 F.3d at 1372. \"In evaluating jury instructions, prejudicial error results when, looking to the instructions as a whole, the substance of the applicable law was [not] fairly and correctly covered.\" Gantt v. City of Los Angeles, 717 F.3d 702, 707 (9th Cir.2013) (quoting Swinton v. Potomac Corp., 270 F.3d 794, 802 (9th Cir. 2001)) (alteration in original). The Ninth Circuit orders a new trial based on jury instruction error only if the error was prejudicial. Id. A motion for a new trial based on insufficiency of evidence may be granted \"only if the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence, or it is quite clear that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result.\" Incalza v. Fendi N. Am., Inc., 479 F.3d 1005, 1013 (9th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nSamsung appeals numerous legal and evidentiary bases for the liability findings and damages awards in the three categories of intellectual property asserted by Apple: trade dresses, design patents, and utility patents. We address each category in turn.\n\nI. Trade Dresses\n\nThe jury found Samsung liable for the likely dilution of Apple's iPhone trade dresses under the Lanham Act. When reviewing Lanham Act claims, we look to the law of the regional circuit where the district court sits. ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH v. Canady Tech. LLC, 629 F.3d 1278, 1287 (Fed.Cir.2010). We therefore apply Ninth Circuit law.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit has explained that \"[t]rade dress is the totality of elements in which a product or service is packaged or presented.\" Stephen W. Boney, Inc. v. Boney Servs., Inc., 127 F.3d 821, 828 (9th Cir.1997). The essential purpose of a trade dress is the same as that of a trademarked word: to identify the source of the product. 1 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a7 8:1 (4th ed.) (\"[L]ike a word asserted to be a trademark, the elements making up the alleged trade dress must have been used in such a manner as to denote product source.\"). In this respect, \"protection for 991*991 trade dress exists to promote competition.\" TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Mktg. Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. 23, 28, 121 S.Ct. 1255, 149 L.Ed.2d 164 (2001).\n\nThe protection for source identification, however, must be balanced against \"a fundamental right to compete through imitation of a competitor's product....\" Leatherman Tool Grp., Inc. v. Cooper Indus., Inc., 199 F.3d 1009, 1011-12 (9th Cir.1999). This \"right can only be temporarily denied by the patent or copyright laws.\" Id. In contrast, trademark law allows for a perpetual monopoly and its use in the protection of \"physical details and design of a product\" must be limited to those that are \"nonfunctional.\" Id. at 1011-12; see also Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prods. Co., 514 U.S. 159, 164-65, 115 S.Ct. 1300, 131 L.Ed.2d 248 (1995) (\"If a product's functional features could be used as trademarks, however, a monopoly over such features could be obtained without regard to whether they qualify as patents and could be extended forever (because trademarks may be renewed in perpetuity).\"). Thus, it is necessary for us to determine first whether Apple's asserted trade dresses, claiming elements from its iPhone product, are nonfunctional and therefore protectable.\n\n\"In general terms, a product feature is functional if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the article.\" Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 850 n. 10, 102 S.Ct. 2182, 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982). \"A product feature need only have some utilitarian advantage to be considered functional.\" Disc Golf Ass'n v. Champion Discs, Inc., 158 F.3d 1002, 1007 (9th Cir.1998). A trade dress, taken as a whole, is functional if it is \"in its particular shape because it works better in this shape.\" Leatherman, 199 F.3d at 1013.\n\n\"[C]ourts have noted that it is, and should be, more difficult to claim product configuration trade dress than other forms of trade dress.\" Id. at 1012-13 (discussing cases). Accordingly, the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have repeatedly found product configuration trade dresses functional and therefore non-protectable. See, e.g., TrafFix, 532 U.S. at 26-27, 35, 121 S.Ct. 1255 (reversing the Sixth Circuit's reversal of the district court's grant of summary judgment that a trade dress on a dual-spring design for temporary road sign stands was functional); Secalt S.A. v. Wuxi Shenxi Const. Mach. Co., 668 F.3d 677, 687 (9th Cir.2012) (affirming summary judgment that a trade dress on a hoist design was functional); Disc Golf, 158 F.3d at 1006 (affirming summary judgment that a trade dress on a disc entrapment design was functional).\n\nMoreover, federal trademark registrations have been found insufficient to save product configuration trade dresses from conclusions of functionality. See, e.g., Talking Rain Beverage Co. v. S. Beach Beverage, 349 F.3d 601, 602 (9th Cir.2003) (affirming summary judgment that registered trade dress covering a bottle design with a grip handle was functional); Tie Tech, Inc. v. Kinedyne Corp., 296 F.3d 778, 782-83 (9th Cir.2002) (affirming summary judgment that registered trade dress covering a handheld cutter design was functional). The Ninth Circuit has even reversed a jury verdict of non-functionality of a product configuration trade dress. See Leatherman, 199 F.3d at 1013 (reversing jury verdict that a trade dress on the overall appearance of a pocket tool was non-functional). Apple conceded during oral argument that it had not cited a single Ninth Circuit case that found a product configuration trade dress to be non-functional. Oral Arg. 49:0630, available at http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oralargument-recordings/14-1335/all.\n\n992*992 The Ninth Circuit's high bar for non-functionality frames our review of the two iPhone trade dresses on appeal. While the parties argue without distinguishing the two trade dresses, the unregistered trade dress and the registered '983 trade dress claim different details and are afforded different evidentiary presumptions under the Lanham Act. We analyze the two trade dresses separately below.\n\nA. Unregistered Trade Dress\n\nApple claims elements from its iPhone 3G and 3GS products to define the asserted unregistered trade dress:\n\na rectangular product with four evenly rounded corners;\n\na flat, clear surface covering the front of the product;\n\na display screen under the clear surface;\n\nsubstantial black borders above and below the display screen and narrower black borders on either side of the screen; and\n\nwhen the device is on, a row of small dots on the display screen, a matrix of colorful square icons with evenly rounded corners within the display screen, and an unchanging bottom dock of colorful square icons with evenly rounded corners set off from the display's other icons.\n\nAppellee's Br. 10-11. As this trade dress is not registered on the principal federal trademark register, Apple \"has the burden of proving that the claimed trade dress, taken as a whole, is not functional....\" See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(c)(4)(A).\n\nApple argues that the unregistered trade dress is nonfunctional under each of the Disc Golf factors that the Ninth Circuit uses to analyze functionality: \"(1) whether the design yields a utilitarian advantage, (2) whether alternative designs are available, (3) whether advertising touts the utilitarian advantages of the design, and (4) whether the particular design results from a comparatively simple or inexpensive method of manufacture.\" See Disc Golf, 158 F.3d at 1006. However, the Supreme Court has more recently held that \"a feature is also functional ... when it affects the cost or quality of the device.\" See TrafFix, 532 U.S. at 33, 121 S.Ct. 1255. The Supreme Court's holding was recognized by the Ninth Circuit as \"short circuiting some of the Disc Golf factors.\" Secalt, 668 F.3d at 686-87. Nevertheless, we explore Apple's contentions on each of the Disc Golf factors and conclude that there was insufficient evidence to support a jury finding in favor of non-functionality on any factor.\n\n1. Utilitarian Advantage\n\nApple argues that \"the iPhone's physical design did not `contribute unusually... to the usability' of the device.\" Appellee's Br. 61 (quoting J.A. 41095:11-12) (alteration in original). Apple further contends that the unregistered trade dress was \"developed ... not for `superior performance.'\" Id. at 62 n. 18. Neither \"unusual usability\" nor \"superior performance,\" however, is the standard used by the Ninth Circuit to determine whether there is any utilitarian advantage. The Ninth Circuit \"has never held, as [plaintiff] suggests, that the product feature must provide superior utilitarian advantages. To the contrary, [the Ninth Circuit] has suggested that in order to establish non-functionality the party with the burden must demonstrate that the product feature serves no purpose other than identification.\" Disc Golf, 158 F.3d at 1007 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe requirement that the unregistered trade dress \"serves no purpose other than identification\" cannot be reasonably inferred from the evidence. Apple emphasizes 993*993 a single aspect of its design, beauty, to imply the lack of other advantages. But the evidence showed that the iPhone's design pursued more than just beauty. Specifically, Apple's executive testified that the theme for the design of the iPhone was:\n\nto create a new breakthrough design for a phone that was beautiful and simple and easy to use and created a beautiful, smooth surface that had a touchscreen and went right to the rim with the bezel around it and looking for a look that we found was beautiful and easy to use and appealing.\n\nJ.A. 40722-23 (emphases added).\n\nMoreover, Samsung cites extensive evidence in the record that showed the usability function of every single element in the unregistered trade dress. For example, rounded corners improve \"pocketability\" and \"durability\" and rectangular shape maximizes the display that can be accommodated. J.A. 40869-70; J.A. 42612-13. A flat clear surface on the front of the phone facilitates touch operation by fingers over a large display. J.A. 42616-17. The bezel protects the glass from impact when the phone is dropped. J.A. 40495. The borders around the display are sized to accommodate other components while minimizing the overall product dimensions. J.A. 40872. The row of dots in the user interface indicates multiple pages of application screens that are available. J.A. 41452-53. The icons allow users to differentiate the applications available to the users and the bottom dock of unchanging icons allows for quick access to the most commonly used applications. J.A. 42560-61; J.A. 40869-70. Apple rebuts none of this evidence.\n\nApple conceded during oral argument that its trade dress \"improved the quality [of the iPhone] in some respects.\" Oral Arg. 56:09-17. It is thus clear that the unregistered trade dress has a utilitarian advantage. See Disc Golf, 158 F.3d at 1007.\n\n2. Alternative Designs\n\nThe next factor requires that purported alternative designs \"offer exactly the same features\" as the asserted trade dress in order to show non-functionality. Tie Tech, 296 F.3d at 786 (quoting Leatherman, 199 F.3d at 1013-14). A manufacturer \"does not have rights under trade dress law to compel its competitors to resort to alternative designs which have a different set of advantages and disadvantages.\" Id.\n\nApple, while asserting that there were \"numerous alternative designs,\" fails to show that any of these alternatives offered exactly the same features as the asserted trade dress. Appellee's Br. 62. Apple simply catalogs the mere existence of other design possibilities embodied in rejected iPhone prototypes and other manufacturers' smartphones. The \"mere existence\" of other designs, however, does not prove that the unregistered trade dress is non-functional. See Talking Rain, 349 F.3d at 604.\n\n3. Advertising of Utilitarian Advantages\n\n\"If a seller advertises the utilitarian advantages of a particular feature, this constitutes strong evidence of functionality.\" Disc Golf, 158 F.3d at 1009. An \"inference\" of a product feature's utility in the plaintiff's advertisement is enough to weigh in favor of functionality of a trade dress encompassing that feature. Id.\n\nApple argues that its advertising was \"[f]ar from touting any utilitarian advantage of the iPhone design....\" Appellee's Br. 60. Apple relies on its executive's testimony that an iPhone advertisement, portraying \"the distinctive design very 994*994 clearly,\" was based on Apple's \"product as hero\" approach. Id. (quoting J.A. 40641-42; 40644:22). The \"product as hero\" approach refers to Apple's stylistic choice of making \"the product the biggest, clearest, most obvious thing in [its] advertisements, often at the expense of anything else around it, to remove all the other elements of communication so [the viewer] see[s] the product most predominantly in the marketing.\" J.A. 40641-42.\n\nApple's arguments focusing on its stylistic choice, however, fail to address the substance of its advertisements. The substance of the iPhone advertisement relied upon by Apple gave viewers \"the ability to see a bit about how it might work,\" for example, \"how flicking and scrolling and tapping and all these multitouch ideas simply [sic].\" J.A. 40644:23-40645:2. Another advertisement cited by Apple similarly displayed the message, \"[t]ouching is believing,\" under a picture showing a user's hand interacting with the graphical user interface of an iPhone. J.A. 24896. Apple fails to show that, on the substance, these demonstrations of the user interface on iPhone's touch screen involved the elements claimed in Apple's unregistered trade dress and why they were not touting the utilitarian advantage of the unregistered trade dress.\n\n4. Method of Manufacture\n\nThe fourth factor considers whether a functional benefit in the asserted trade dress arises from \"economies in manufacture or use,\" such as being \"relatively simple or inexpensive to manufacture.\" Disc Golf, 158 F.3d at 1009.\n\nApple contends that \"[t]he iPhone design did not result from a `comparatively simple or inexpensive method of manufacture'\" because Apple experienced manufacturing challenges. Appellee's Br. 61 (quoting Talking Rain, 349 F.3d at 603). Apple's manufacturing challenges, however, resulted from the durability considerations for the iPhone and not from the design of the unregistered trade dress. According to Apple's witnesses, difficulties resulted from its choices of materials in using \"hardened steel\"; \"very high, high grade of steel\"; and, \"glass that was not breakable enough, scratch resistant enough.\" Id. (quoting J.A. 40495-96, 41097). These materials were chosen, for example, for the iPhone to survive a drop:\n\nIf you drop this, you don't have to worry about the ground hitting the glass. You have to worry about the band of steel surrounding the glass hitting the glass.... In order to, to make it work, we had to use very high, high grade of steel because we couldn't have it sort of deflecting into the glass.\n\nJ.A. 40495-96. The durability advantages that resulted from the manufacturing challenges, however, are outside the scope of what Apple defines as its unregistered trade dress. For the design elements that comprise Apple's unregistered trade dress, Apple points to no evidence in the record to show they were not relatively simple or inexpensive to manufacture. See Disc Golf, 158 F.3d at 1009 (\"[Plaintiff], which has the burden of proof, offered no evidence that the [asserted] design was not relatively simple or inexpensive to manufacture.\").\n\nIn sum, Apple has failed to show that there was substantial evidence in the record to support a jury finding in favor of non-functionality for the unregistered trade dress on any of the Disc Golf factors. Apple fails to rebut the evidence that the elements in the unregistered trade dress serve the functional purpose of improving usability. Rather, Apple focuses on the \"beauty\" of its design, even though Apple pursued both \"beauty\" and functionality in the design of the iPhone. We therefore 995*995 reverse the district court's denial of Samsung's motion for judgment as a matter of law that the unregistered trade dress is functional and therefore not protectable.\n\nB. The Registered '983 Trade Dress\n\nIn contrast to the unregistered trade dress, the '983 trade dress is a federally registered trademark. The federal trademark registration provides \"prima facie evidence\" of non-functionality. Tie Tech, 296 F.3d at 782-83. This presumption \"shift[s] the burden of production to the defendant ... to provide evidence of functionality.\" Id. at 783. Once this presumption is overcome, the registration loses its legal significance on the issue of functionality. Id. (\"In the face of sufficient and undisputed facts demonstrating functionality, ... the registration loses its evidentiary significance.\").\n\nThe '983 trade dress claims the design details in each of the sixteen icons on the iPhone's home screen framed by the iPhone's rounded-rectangular shape with silver edges and a black background:\n\nThe first icon depicts the letters \"SMS\" in green inside a white speech bubble on a green background;\n\n. . .\n\nthe seventh icon depicts a map with yellow and orange roads, a pin with a red head, and a red-and-blue road sign with the numeral \"280\" in white;\n\n. . .\n\nthe sixteenth icon depicts the distinctive configuration of applicant's media player device in white over an orange background.\n\n'983 trade dress (omitting thirteen other icon design details for brevity).\n\nIt is clear that individual elements claimed by the '983 trade dress are functional. For example, there is no dispute that the claimed details such as \"the seventh icon depicts a map with yellow and orange roads, a pin with a red head, and a red-and-blue road sign with the numeral `280' in white\" are functional. See id. Apple's user interface expert testified on how icon designs promote usability. This expert agreed that \"the whole point of an icon on a smartphone is to communicate to the consumer using that product, that if they hit that icon, certain functionality will occur on the phone.\" J.A. 41458-59. The expert further explained that icons are \"[v]isual shorthand for something\" and that \"rectangular containers\" for icons provide \"more real estate\" to accommodate the icon design. J.A. 41459, 41476. Apple rebuts none of this evidence.\n\nApple contends instead that Samsung improperly disaggregates the '983 trade dress into individual elements to argue functionality. But Apple fails to explain how the total combination of the sixteen icon designs in the context of iPhone's screen-dominated rounded-rectangular shape\u2014all part of the iPhone's \"easy to use\" design theme\u2014somehow negates the undisputed usability function of the individual elements. See J.A. 40722-23. Apple's own brief even relies on its expert's testimony about the \"instant recognizability due to highly intuitive icon usage\" on \"the home screen of the iPhone.\" J.A. 41484; Appellee's Br. 43, 70, 71 (quoting J.A. 41484). Apple's expert was discussing an analysis of the iPhone's overall combination of icon designs that allowed a user to recognize quickly particular applications to use. J.A. 41484, 25487. The iPhone's usability advantage from the combination of its icon designs shows that the '983 trade dress viewed as a whole \"is nothing other than the assemblage of functional parts....\" See Tie Tech, 296 F.3d at 786 (quoting Leatherman, 199 F.3d at 1013). There is no \"separate `overall appearance' which is non-functional.\" Id. (quoting 996*996 Leatherman, 199 F.3d at 1013). The undisputed facts thus demonstrate the functionality of the '983 trade dress. \"In the face of sufficient and undisputed facts demonstrating functionality, as in our case, the registration loses its evidentiary significance.\" See id. at 783.\n\nThe burden thus shifts back to Apple. See id. But Apple offers no analysis of the icon designs claimed by the '983 trade dress. Rather, Apple argues generically for its two trade dresses without distinction under the Disc Golf factors. Among Apple's lengthy citations to the record, we can find only two pieces of information that involve icon designs. One is Apple's user interface expert discussing other possible icon designs. The other is a citation to a print iPhone advertisement that included the icon designs claimed in the '983 trade dress. These two citations, viewed in the most favorable light to Apple, would be relevant to only two of the Disc Golf factors: \"alternative design\" and \"advertising.\" But the cited evidence suffers from the same defects as discussed in subsections I.A.2 and I.A.3. Specifically, the expert's discussion of other icon design possibilities does not show that the other design possibilities \"offer[ed] exactly the same features\" as the '983 trade dress. See Tie Tech, 296 F.3d at 786 (quoting Leatherman, 199 F.3d at 1013-14). The print iPhone advertisement also fails to establish that, on the substance, it was not touting the utilitarian advantage of the '983 trade dress. The evidence cited by Apple therefore does not show the non-functionality of the '983 trade dress.\n\nIn sum, the undisputed evidence shows the functionality of the registered '983 trade dress and shifts the burden of proving non-functionality back to Apple. Apple, however, has failed to show that there was substantial evidence in the record to support a jury finding in favor of non-functionality for the '983 trade dress on any of the Disc Golf factors. We therefore reverse the district court's denial of Samsung's motion for judgment as a matter of law that the '983 trade dress is functional and therefore not protectable.\n\nBecause we conclude that the jury's findings of non-functionality of the asserted trade dresses were not supported by substantial evidence, we do not reach Samsung's arguments on the fame and likely dilution of the asserted trade dresses, the Patent Clause of the Constitution, or the dilution damages.\n\nII. Design Patents\n\nThe design patents on appeal claim certain design elements embodied in the iPhone. The D'677 patent focuses on design elements on the front face of the iPhone:\n\n997*997 \n\nThe D'087 patent claims another set of design features that extend to the bezel of the iPhone:\n\nThe D'305 patent claims \"the ornamental design for a graphical user interface for a display screen or portion thereof\" as shown in the following drawing:\n\n998*998 Samsung contends that it should not have been found liable for infringement of the asserted design patents because any similarity was limited to the basic or functional elements in the design patents. Moreover, according to Samsung, there was no evidence of actual deception of consumers and that the differences between the accused smartphones and the asserted design patents should have been clear if prior art designs were properly considered. Samsung raises these three issues\u2014functionality, actual deception, and comparison to prior art\u2014in the context of the jury instructions and the sufficiency of evidence to support the infringement verdict. Finally, Samsung argues that the district court legally erred in allowing the jury to award as damages Samsung's entire profits on its infringing smartphones. We do not find any of these challenges persuasive as discussed below.\n\nA. Infringement\n\n1. Jury Instructions\n\na. Functional Aspects in the Asserted Design Patents\n\n\"Where a design contains both functional and nonfunctional elements, the scope of the claim must be construed in order to identify the non-functional aspects of the design as shown in the patent.\" OddzOn Prods., Inc. v. Just Toys, Inc., 122 F.3d 1396, 1405 (Fed.Cir.1997). Samsung contends that the district court erred in failing to exclude the functional aspects of the design patents either in the claim construction or elsewhere in the infringement jury instructions. Specifically, Samsung contends that the district court should have excluded elements that are \"`dictated by their functional purpose,' or cover the `structural ... aspects of the article.'\" Appellants' Br. 23 (quoting Richardson v. Stanley Works, Inc., 597 F.3d 1288, 1294 (Fed.Cir.2010); Lee v. Dayton-Hudson Corp., 838 F.2d 1186, 1188 (Fed.Cir.1988)) (alteration in original) (citation omitted). Such elements, according to Samsung, should be \"ignored\" in their entirety from the design patent claim scope. Id. at 29. For example, Samsung contends that rectangular form and rounded corners are among such elements that should be ignored in the infringement analysis. See, e.g., id.\n\nOur case law does not support Samsung's position. In Richardson, the design patent at issue depicted a multifunction tool with numerous components that were \"dictated by their functional purpose.\" 597 F.3d at 1294. But the claim construction in Richardson did not exclude those components in their entirety. Rather, the claim construction included the ornamental aspects of those components: \"the standard shape of the hammer-head, the diamond-shaped flare of the crow-bar and the top of the jaw, the rounded neck, the orientation of the crow-bar relative to the head of the tool, and the plain, undecorated handle.\" Richardson v. Stanley Works, Inc., 610 F.Supp.2d 1046, 1050 (D.Ariz. 2009). That construction was affirmed on appeal. Richardson, 597 F.3d at 1294. As such, the language \"dictated by their functional purpose\" in Richardson was only a description of the facts there; it did not establish a rule to eliminate entire elements from the claim scope as Samsung argues.\n\nOur case law likewise does not support Samsung's proposed rule of eliminating any \"structural\" aspect from the claim scope. Samsung arrives at its proposed rule by selecting a few words from the following statement in Lee: \"[d]esign patents do not and cannot include claims to the structural or functional aspects of the article....\" 838 F.2d at 1188. But that statement addressed design patent validity. See id. (quoting 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.153(a) on a design patent application requirement). 999*999 It did not specify a rule, as Samsung represents, to eliminate elements from the claim scope of a valid patent in analyzing infringement.\n\nMore directly applicable to the claim scope issue at hand, Lee stated elsewhere that \"it is the non-functional, design aspects that are pertinent to determinations of infringement.\" Id. (footnote omitted). That principle was properly reflected in this case in the district court's construction of the design patents as claiming only \"the ornamental design\" as shown in the patent figures. J.A. 01390-91. Samsung has not persuasively shown how the district court's claim constructions were legally erroneous under Lee or Richardson. See Richardson, 597 F.3d at 1295 (noting that \"discounting of functional elements must not convert the overall infringement test to an element-by-element comparison\").\n\nSamsung asserted alternatively during oral argument that the jury should have been instructed to compare the accused Samsung smartphones to the \"overall ornamental appearance\" of a patented design, instead of simply \"the overall appearance\" as the district court provided. Oral Arg. 4:06-4:25, 5:54-6:10. According to Samsung, \"crucially, what's missing there is the word `ornamental.'\" Id. at 4:25-4:28. But jury instructions are reviewed \"as a whole\" to determine whether \"the substance of the applicable law was [not] fairly and correctly covered\" such that the alleged error was prejudicial. See Gantt, 717 F.3d at 706 (quoting Swinton, 270 F.3d at 802) (alteration in original). The jury instructions, as a whole, already limited the scope of the asserted design patents to the \"ornamental\" elements through the claim constructions as discussed earlier: the design patents were each construed as claiming \"the ornamental design\" as shown in the patent figures. J.A. 01390-91. As such, Samsung has failed to show prejudicial error in the jury instructions as a whole that would warrant a new trial.\n\nb. Actual Deception and Role of Prior Art\n\nSamsung further contends that the infringement instruction was erroneous for stating that actual deception was not required, and for providing guidelines in considering prior art. A design patent is infringed if an ordinary observer would have been deceived: \"if, in the eye of an ordinary observer, giving such attention as a purchaser usually gives, two designs are substantially the same, if the resemblance is such as to deceive such an observer, inducing him to purchase one supposing it to be the other, the first one patented is infringed by the other.\" Gorham Co. v. White, 81 U.S. 511, 528, 14 Wall. 511, 20 L.Ed. 731 (1872). Moreover, an infringement analysis must include a comparison of the asserted design against the prior art: \"[i]f the accused design has copied a particular feature of the claimed design that departs conspicuously from the prior art, the accused design is naturally more likely to be regarded as deceptively similar to the claimed design, and thus infringing.\" Egyptian Goddess, Inc. v. Swisa, Inc., 543 F.3d 665, 678 (Fed.Cir.2008) (en banc).\n\nThese holdings from Gorham and Egyptian Goddess were reflected in the infringement instruction here, and Samsung does not contend otherwise. Samsung argues instead that the portions in the infringement instruction highlighted below made the jury consider a lack of actual deception irrelevant and led the jury to disregard the prior art:\n\nTwo designs are substantially the same if, in the eye of an ordinary observer, giving such attention as a purchaser usually gives, the resemblance between 1000*1000 the two designs is such as to deceive such an observer, inducing him to purchase one supposing it to be the other. You do not need, however, to find that any purchasers actually were deceived or confused by the appearance of the accused Samsung products. ...\n\nThis determination of whether two designs are substantially the same will benefit from comparing the two designs with prior art. You must familiarize yourself with the prior art admitted at trial in making your determination of whether there has been direct infringement.\n\nYou may find the following guidelines helpful to your analysis ....\n\nJ.A. 1394 (emphases added).\n\nWe conclude instead that the jury instruction simply clarified that actual deception was not required, which is an accurate reflection of the analysis in Gorham. See 81 U.S. at 530 (crediting expert opinions \"that ordinary purchasers would be likely to mistake the [accused] designs for the [patented design]\").\n\nWe also conclude that the jury instruction expressly required that each juror \"must\" consider the prior art admitted at trial. J.A. 1394 (\"You must familiarize yourself with the prior art admitted at trial in making your determination of whether there has been direct infringement.\"). The jury instruction's guidelines did not reduce the entire prior art analysis to a mere option as Samsung contends.\n\nSamsung again has failed to show that \"when, looking to the instructions as a whole, the substance of the applicable law was [not] fairly and correctly covered.\" See Gantt, 717 F.3d at 706 (quoting Swinton, 270 F.3d at 802) (alteration in original).\n\n2. Supporting Evidence\n\nSamsung contends that the infringement verdict was not supported by substantial evidence. Samsung's contentions, however, are premised on the same issues\u2014functionality, actual deception, and comparison to prior art\u2014it raises in the context of the jury instructions. See, e.g., Appellants' Br. 27 (\"The uncontroverted evidence at trial showed the claimed features in Apple's design patents to be overwhelmingly not ornamental, but structural or functional.\").\n\nHaving rejected the jury instruction challenges, we likewise find Samsung's parallel substantial evidence complaints unpersuasive. Apple's witnesses provided sufficient testimonies to allow the jury to account for any functional aspects in the asserted design patents. Additionally, the witnesses testified on the similar overall visual impressions of the accused products to the asserted design patents such that an ordinary observer would likely be deceived. Apple's experts also testified about the differences between the asserted patents and both the prior art and other competing designs. The jury could have reasonably relied on the evidence in the record to reach its infringement verdict.\n\n3. Preclusion of Evidence\n\nSamsung also appeals the district court's preclusion of testimony on Samsung's independent development of its F700 phone that pre-dated the iPhone to rebut an allegation of copying. The evidence on the F700 was previously excluded as a prior art reference under a Rule 37 sanction due to Samsung's failure to timely disclose the evidence during discovery, which Samsung does not challenge.\n\nThe district court found that Samsung's witness did not design any of the accused devices and was unaware that any of the accused devices was based on the F700. 1001*1001 The district court thus determined that the proffered testimony of Samsung's witness would have limited probative value on the question of whether Samsung copied any of Apple's design patents because she lacked first-hand knowledge relevant to the underlying issue. As a result, the district court concluded that the limited probative value of the testimony was out-weighed by the likelihood that it would be considered by the jury for the prohibited purpose under the earlier Rule 37 sanction. We find that the district court acted within its discretion in precluding Samsung's proffered testimony to rebut an allegation of copying.\n\nWe conclude that there was no prejudicial legal error in the infringement jury instructions on the three issues that Samsung raises: functionality, actual deception, and comparison to prior art. We further conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Samsung's evidence of independent development and that there was substantial evidence to support the jury's infringement findings. We therefore affirm the district court's denial of Samsung's motion for judgment as a matter of law on design patent infringement and Samsung's alternative motion for a new trial.\n\nB. Damages\n\nFinally, with regard to the design patents, Samsung argues that the district court legally erred in allowing the jury to award Samsung's entire profits on its infringing smartphones as damages. The damages, according to Samsung, should have been limited to the profit attributable to the infringement because of \"basic causation principles....\" Appellants' Br. 36-37. Samsung contends that \"Apple failed to establish that infringement of its limited design patents ... caused any Samsung sales or profits.\" Id. at 40. Samsung further contends that consumers chose Samsung based on a host of other factors. Id.\n\nThese \"causation\" arguments, however, advocate the same \"apportionment\" requirement that Congress rejected. See Nike, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 138 F.3d 1437, 1441 (Fed.Cir.1998). \"Apportionment... required [the patentee] to show what portion of the infringer's profit, or of his own lost profit, was due to the design and what portion was due to the article itself.... The Act of 1887, specific to design patents, removed the apportionment requirement....\" Id. The provisions in the Act of 1887 on design patent infringement damages were subsequently codified in Section 289 of Title 35. Id. at 1440-43 (containing a detailed and thorough discussion of the legislative history that need not be repeated here).\n\nSection 289 now provides:\n\nWhoever during the term of a patent for a design, without license of the owner, (1) applies the patented design, or any colorable imitation thereof, to any article of manufacture for the purpose of sale, or (2) sells or exposes for sale any article of manufacture to which such design or colorable imitation has been applied shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit, but not less than $250, recoverable in any United States district court having jurisdiction of the parties. Nothing in this section shall prevent, lessen, or impeach any other remedy which an owner of an infringed patent has under the provisions of this title, but he shall not twice recover the profit made from the infringement.\n\n35 U.S.C. \u00a7 289 (emphasis added). In reciting that an infringer \"shall be liable to the owner to the extent of [the infringer's] total profit,\" Section 289 explicitly authorizes the award of total profit from the article of manufacture bearing the patented 1002*1002 design.[bookmark: r[1]][1] Several other courts also concluded that Section 289 authorizes such award of total profit. See Schnadig Corp. v. Gaines Mfg. Co., 620 F.2d 1166, 1171 (6th Cir.1980); Henry Hanger & Display Fixture Corp. of Am. v. Sel-O-Rak Corp., 270 F.2d 635, 643-44 (5th Cir.1959); Bergstrom v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 496 F.Supp. 476, 495 (D.Minn.1980). The clear statutory language prevents us from adopting a \"causation\" rule as Samsung urges.\n\nSamsung continues its quest for apportionment by arguing, alternatively, that the profits awarded should have been limited to the infringing \"article of manufacture,\" not the entire infringing product. Samsung argues for limiting the profits awarded to \"the portion of the product as sold that incorporates or embodies the subject matter of the patent.\" Appellants' Br. 38. Samsung contends that the Second Circuit had \"allowed an award of infringer's profits from the patented design of a piano case but not from the sale of the entire piano....\" Id. These Second Circuit opinions, however, addressed a factual situation where \"[a] purchaser desiring a piano of a particular manufacturer may have the piano placed in any one of several cases dealt in by the maker.\" Bush & Lane Piano Co. v. Becker Bros., 222 F. 902, 903 (2d Cir.1915). That factual situation occurred in the context of the commercial practice in 1915 in which ordinary purchasers regarded a piano and a piano case as distinct articles of manufacture. The facts at hand are different. The innards of Samsung's smartphones were not sold separately from their shells as distinct articles of manufacture to ordinary purchasers. We thus do not agree with Samsung that these Second Circuit cases required the district court to limit the damages for design patent infringement in this case.\n\nWe agree with the district court that there was no legal error in the jury instruction on the design patent damages. Samsung does not argue a lack of substantial evidence to support the damages awards under the district court's jury instruction. We therefore affirm the damages awarded for design patent infringements.\n\nIII. Utility Patents\n\nFinally, Samsung challenges the validity of claim 50 of the '163 patent and claim 8 of the '915 patent. Samsung also challenges the damages awarded for utility patent infringement.\n\nA. Validity\n\n1. Indefiniteness of Claim 50 of the '163 Patent\n\nClaim 50 of the '163 patent relates to a user interface feature in which a user's double tapping on a portion of an electronic document causes the portion to be enlarged and \"substantially centered\" on the display. '163 patent, claim 50. Samsung contends that claim 50 is indefinite because the '163 patent provides \"no objective standard to measure the scope of the term `substantially centered.'\" Appellants' Br. 66.\n\nSamsung's complaint about a lack of an \"objective standard [of] measure\" is seeking a level of precision that exceeds the definiteness required of valid patents. \"The definiteness requirement... mandates clarity, while recognizing 1003*1003 that absolute precision is unattainable.\" Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., ___ U.S. ___, 134 S.Ct. 2120, 2129, 189 L.Ed.2d 37 (2014). Given this recognition, \"a patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification delineating the patent, and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\" Id. at 2124.\n\nSamsung, however, points to no evidence showing that skilled artisans would find the element \"substantially centered\" as lacking reasonable certainty in its scope. In contrast, Apple's expert explained that the \"padding\" allowed in the '163 patent provides skilled artisans with enough information to understand what \"substantially centered\" means in the patent. J.A. 41907-09. Apple's expert cites a discussion in the specification of an embodiment referring to the figure reproduced below where the enlarged portion of the document is essentially centered except for \"a predefined amount of padding along the sides of the display.\" See '163 patent col. 17 ll. 26-30.\n\nApple thus presented evidence to show that skilled artisans would interpret \"substantially centered\" in the '163 patent to mean essentially centered except for a marginal spacing to accommodate ancillary graphical user interface elements. We are not persuaded by Samsung's attempt to discredit this expert testimony. We therefore agree with the district court that Samsung failed to carry its burden in challenging the validity of claim 50 of the '163 patent for indefiniteness.\n\n2. Anticipation of Claim 8 of the '915 Patent\n\nClaim 8 of the '915 patent describes a computer-based method for distinguishing between scrolling and gesture (such as zooming) operations on a touch screen. '915 patent, claim 8. The dispute centers on whether a prior art reference, the Nomura patent application, taught the \"event object\" element in claim 8. The claim recites \"event object\" in the context such as: \"creating an event object in response to the user input; determining whether the event object invokes a scroll or gesture operation....\" Id. Samsung contends that the \"movement history\" in Nomura inherently disclosed the \"event object\" in claim 8 based on the opinion of its expert. Appellants' Br. 64-65.\n\nApple, however, rebuts with its own expert testimony. Apple's expert explained that \"event objects\" in claim 8 refers to a particular \"programming construct[]\" and that there were many potential programming alternatives that Nomura could have used to implement the \"movement history\" it disclosed. J.A. 43636-37. According to the explanation by Apple's expert, Nomura did not inherently disclose the claimed \"event object.\" We find that a reasonable jury could have credited the testimony of Apple's expert over Samsung's expert. Thus, we agree with the district court that 1004*1004 there was substantial evidence to support the jury's finding that claim 8 of the '915 patent was not anticipated.\n\nB. Damages\n\nApple advanced at trial both lost profits and reasonable royalty damages theories. The jury determined that for certain Samsung phones found to infringe the '915 patent, no reasonable non-infringing alternative was available, and thus lost profits was an appropriate measure of damages. For the other Samsung phones found to infringe Apple's utility patents-in-suit, the jury determined that an award of lost profits was not supported, and thus awarded Apple a reasonable royalty for Samsung's infringement.\n\n1. Lost Profits for Infringement of the '915 Patent\n\n\"To recover lost profits, the patent owner must show causation in fact, establishing that but for the infringement, he would have made additional profits.\" Grain Processing Corp. v. Am. Maize-Prods., 185 F.3d 1341, 1349 (Fed.Cir.1999). The patentee must \"take[] into account any alternatives available to the infringer.\" Id. at 1351. \"[M]arket sales of an acceptable noninfringing substitute often suffice alone to defeat a case for lost profits.\" Id. at 1352.\n\nSamsung argues that lost profits should not have been awarded because the evidence showed the existence of non-infringing substitutes. Specifically, Samsung contends that two Samsung phones, found to have not infringed the '915 patent, should have been considered by the jury as non-infringing substitutes. Samsung further asserts that Apple failed to prove consumer preference of the '915 patent's technology over a purportedly comparable feature available in the two non-infringing Samsung phones.\n\nHowever, \"the `[m]ere existence of a competing device does not make that device an acceptable substitute.'\" Presidio Components, Inc. v. Am. Tech. Ceramics Corp., 702 F.3d 1351, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2012) (quoting TWM Mfg. Co. v. Dura Corp., 789 F.2d 895, 901 (Fed.Cir.1986)) (alteration in original). The mere existence of non-infringing phones is all Samsung is relying on to attack the jury's verdict. For example, Samsung points to no evidence to support its assertion that the two non-infringing phones included a feature comparable to the one claimed in the '915 patent.\n\nIn contrast, there was substantial evidence to support the jury's refusal to consider the two phones asserted by Samsung as non-infringing substitutes. Of these two phones, one had significantly different features, such as a slide-out physical keyboard in combination with a small, low-resolution screen. See Kaufman Co. v. Lantech, Inc., 926 F.2d 1136, 1142 (Fed. Cir.1991) (\"To be deemed acceptable, the alleged acceptable noninfringing substitute must not have a disparately higher price than or possess characteristics significantly different from the patented product.\"). And the other phone was never sold by a U.S. carrier. See Grain Processing, 185 F.3d at 1349 (\"[T]o be an acceptable non-infringing substitute, the product or process must have been available or on the market at the time of infringement.\"). The jury could have reasonably found that these two Samsung phones were not acceptable alternatives. Samsung's unsupported assertion to the contrary fails to show a lack of substantial evidence supporting the awards of lost profits.\n\n2. Reasonable Royalty\n\nSamsung argues that Apple's expert in the damages retrial, Ms. Davis, offered only a cursory explanation of how she arrived 1005*1005 at the royalty rates she calculated based on the Georgia-Pacific factors. Samsung complains specifically about Ms. Davis's testimony that the evidence of demand from her lost profits analysis was \"also relevant to the determination of the amount of reasonable royalties.\" Appellants' Br. 72.\n\nSamsung does not dispute that Ms. Davis sufficiently explained her analysis of demand in the lost profit context. Samsung is only challenging that she did not repeat the same information with all of the details in testifying about her reasonable royalty calculation. However, Ms. Davis expressly testified that the demand factor for lost profits was also relevant to the determination of a reasonable royalty. J.A. 50651-52 (\"Q. Is this issue of demand relevant to any category of damages other than lost profits? A. Yes. It's relevant to the determination of the amount of reasonable royalties.\"). A reasonable jury could refer to Ms. Davis's testimony from an earlier context and appropriately weigh the evidence in considering Ms. Davis's calculation on the royalty rates. Moreover, Ms. Davis's testimony included additional substance on the Georgia-Pacific factors. For example, Ms. Davis expressly considered the cost to Samsung of being out of the market long enough to design around the patents, the profits attributable to Samsung's use of the patented technology, and the commercial relationship between the parties. Taken as a whole, Ms. Davis's testimony provided sufficient evidence to support the jury's reasonable royalty awards in the damages retrial.\n\nFinally, Samsung complained that Apple's expert in the first damages trial, Mr. Musika, failed to explain his Georgia-Pacific analysis and identified no evidence supporting his royalty rates. Upon Apple's response, Samsung acknowledges that Mr. Musika did in fact identify and discuss specific Georgia-Pacific factors and that Mr. Musika referred to an exhibit during his testimony. Samsung now contends that the analysis was not meaningful and the cited exhibit did not discuss the Georgia-Pacific's factors at all. Samsung's fault-finding is meritless.\n\nWe therefore affirm the district court's denial of Samsung's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the invalidity of claim 50 of the '163 patent and claim 8 of the '915 patent, as well as the damages awarded for utility patent infringement. We also affirm the district court's denial of Samsung's motions for a new trial on these same issues. We remand for immediate entry of final judgment on all damages awards not predicated on Apple's trade dress claims and for any further proceedings necessitated by our decision to vacate the jury's verdicts on the unregistered and registered trade dress claims.\n\nAFFIRMED-IN-PART, REVERSED-IN-PART, VACATED-IN-PART and REMANDED\n\nCOSTS\n\nEach party shall bear its own costs.\n\n[bookmark: [1]][1]  Amici 27 Law Professors argues that an award of a defendant's entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.

Defendants counterclaimed against Finjan for infringement of U.S. Patents No. 6,357,010 (\"'010 patent\") and No. 7,185,361 (\"'361 patent\"). A jury found that none of the patents was invalid, that Finjan did not infringe Defendants' patents, and that Defendants willfully infringed all asserted claims of Finjan's patents. The district court awarded damages to Finjan, enhanced the award under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284, and imposed a permanent injunction against Defendants.\n\nDefendants appeal infringement and damages. Finjan cross-appeals denial of damages for the period between the entry of judgment and the entry of the injunction. We affirm the verdict of infringement on the asserted \"system\" and \"storage medium\" claims, but reverse the verdict of infringement on the asserted method claims. We also affirm the damages award, but remand for determination of post-judgment, pre-injunction damages.\n\n*1201 BACKGROUND\n\nFinjan's asserted patents relate to proactive scanning, or techniques directed to detecting and defeating previously unknown, Internet-based threats to computers, such as viruses.\n\nThe '194 patent is entitled a \"System and Method for Protecting a Computer and a Network From Hostile Downloadables.\" Claim 1 is representative:\n\n1. A computer-based method, comprising the steps of:\nreceiving an incoming Downloadable addressed to a client, by a server that serves as a gateway to the client;\ncomparing, by the server, Downloadable security profile data pertaining to the Downloadable, the Downloadable security profile data includes a list a [sic] suspicious computer operations that may be attempted by the Downloadable, against a security policy to determine if the security policy has been violated; and\npreventing execution of the Downloadable by the client if the security policy has been violated.\nThe asserted claims include method claims (1-14, 24-30) and corresponding \"system\" (32-36) and \"computer-readable storage medium\" (65) claims for performing the claimed methods.\n\nThe '780 patent bears the same title as the '194 patent and covers \"caching,\" or identifying previously encountered downloadable files. Representative claim 1 describes:\n\n1. A computer-based method for generating a Downloadable ID to identify a Downloadable, comprising:\nobtaining a Downloadable that includes one or more references to software components required to be executed by the Downloadable;\nfetching at least one software component identified by the one or more references; and\nperforming a hashing function on the Downloadable and the fetched software components to generate a Downloadable ID.\nLike the '194 patent, the asserted claims of the '780 patent include method claims (1-6), system claims (9-14), and a computer-readable storage medium claim (18).\n\nThe '822 patent is directed to a \"Malicious Mobile Code Runtime Monitoring System and Methods\" and addresses \"sandboxing\" potentially dangerous downloadables with protective code. Representative claim 4 covers:\n\n4. A processor-based method, comprising:\nreceiving downloadable-information;\ndetermining whether the downloadable-information includes executable code; and\ncausing mobile protection code to be communicated to at least one information-destination of the downloadable-information, if the downloadable-information is determined to include executable code,\nwherein the causing mobile protection code to be communicated comprises forming a sandboxed package including the mobile protection code and the downloadable-information, and causing the sandboxed package to be communicated to the at least one information-destination.\nThe relevant claims encompass \"processor-based methods\" (4, 6, 8) and \"processor-based systems\" (12-13). Thus, the asserted claims of each patent in suit include both method and non-method claims.\n\nDefendants sold three accused computer security products: a \"Webwasher\" software download, a \"Web-washer\" hardware *1202 \"appliance\" or server containing software, and a \"Cyberguard TSP\" hardware appliance that also contains software. Defs.' Principal Br. 11. It is undisputed that all three products contain source code for eight software modules. Three of those modules\u0097Anti-Virus, Anti-Malware, and Content Protection\u0097offer proactive scanning functionality, in addition to other features. The eight modules are \"locked\" when the three products are sold, requiring a customer to purchase a separate key to activate each individual module. Therefore, a customer who purchases an accused product can activate all, some, or none of the eight modules at different cost. See Tr. of Jury Trial (Day Four), Mar. 6, 2008, 704:6-20.[1]\n\nFinjan alleged that Defendants directly infringed under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a) by testing and selling the accused products. Finjan did not assert any theories of indirect infringement. The jury found that Defendants willfully infringed all asserted claims, either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents. Joint Special Verdict Form 2-6. It also found that Finjan did not infringe any asserted claims of the '010 and '361 patents, and that none of the five patents in suit was invalid. The jury awarded Finjan $9.18 million in royalties. Id. at 10. The parties filed various motions for judgment as a matter of law (\"JMOL\") or a new trial under Rules 50 and 59(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court denied those motions, but enhanced damages by 50%, awarded damages that accrued between the verdict and entry of judgment, and entered a permanent injunction. Finjan Software, Ltd. v. Secure Computing Corp., No. 06-CV-369,  2009 WL 2524495 (D.Del. Aug.18, 2009) (\"Memorandum\").\n\nDefendants appeal the verdicts of infringement of Finjan's patents and damages, but do not appeal the jury's determinations regarding noninfringement of Defendants' patents, validity of all patents, or willfulness with respect to infringement of Finjan's patents. Finjan cross-appeals only the district court's damages ruling, claiming additional entitlement to post-judgment, pre-injunction damages. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nI. Infringement\n\n\"A determination of infringement is a question of fact that is reviewed for substantial evidence when tried to a jury.\" ACCO Brands, Inc. v. ABA Locks Mfr. Co., 501 F.3d 1307, 1311 (Fed.Cir.2007). We review denial of post-trial motions for JMOL and new trial under regional circuit law. Revolution Eyewear, Inc. v. Aspex Eyewear, Inc., 563 F.3d 1358, 1370 (Fed. Cir.2009).\n\nIn the Third Circuit, review of denial of JMOL is plenary. McKenna v. City of Phila., 582 F.3d 447, 460 (3d Cir. 2009). \"[W]e must review the record in the light most favorable to the prevailing party unless the record is critically deficient of that minimum quantum of evidence from which a jury might reasonably afford relief.\" Potence v. Hazleton Area Sch. Dist., 357 F.3d 366, 370 (3d Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). \"The standard of review on a motion for a new trial is abuse of discretion, except where a district court bases its denial of the motion on an application of law, in which case an appellate court's review is plenary.\" McKenna, 582 F.3d at 460. The Third Circuit views the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Grazier v. City of Phila., 328 F.3d 120, 128 (3d Cir.2003). *1203 \"[N]ew trials because the verdict is against the weight of the evidence are proper only when the record shows that the jury's verdict resulted in a miscarriage of justice or where the verdict, on the record, cries out to be overturned or shocks our conscience.\" Williamson v. Consol. Rail Corp., 926 F.2d 1344, 1353 (3d Cir.1991).\n\nA. System and Storage Medium Claims\n\nIn a nutshell, Defendants' noninfringement theory is that they sold no infringing products because all software modules that feature proactive scanning were locked when sold. \"For the customer,\" according to Defendants, \"as a practical matter, it was the same as if it never received the source code for the `locked down' modules and their features at all.\" Defs.' Principal Br. 5. Defendants argue that infringement occurred only when customers purchased keys and unlocked proactive scanning modules because \"[d]isabled code, by definition, is incapable of being used.\" Id. 28. Thus, Defendants claim that Finjan's failure to allege indirect or joint infringement is fatal.\n\nFinjan responds first with a waiver argument, claiming that Defendants forfeited their contention that locked software cannot infringe by failing to raise it in their JMOL motions. This court disagrees. It is correct that \"[i]f a party seeks a judgment in its favor based on insufficiency of the evidence, he must file for judgment as a matter of law both before the case is submitted to the jury and after a verdict is returned.\" Pediatrix Screening, Inc. v. TeleChem Int'l, Inc., 602 F.3d 541, 546 (3d Cir.2010). But here, Defendants orally moved for JMOL of noninfringement under Rule 50(a) at the close of Finjan's case. While the district court denied the motion, Transcript at 687:1-688:8, challenging infringement orally was sufficient, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(b)(1)(A). Defendants also filed a written Rule 50(a) motion on the last day of trial, repeating its noninfringement position. See Defs.-Counterclaimants' Mot. for JMOL Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. The district court considered these issues preserved and reserved judgment until the parties renewed their JMOL motions after trial under Rule 50(b). Memorandum at 2 & n. 1; Transcript at 673:12-21. In that renewed motion, Defendants reiterated their noninfringement argument and fully explained their locked software theory. See Defs.-Counterclaimants' Mot. for JMOL and New Trial. Importantly, Finjan did not oppose Defendants' Rule 50(b) motion on waiver grounds, thereby itself waiving this objection. See Williams v. Runyon, 130 F.3d 568, 572 (3d Cir.1997) (adopting rule that \"where a party did not object to a movant's Rule 50(b) motion specifically on the grounds that the issue was waived by an inadequate Rule 50(a) motion, the party's right to object on that basis is itself waived\"). Moreover, even if Defendants' Rule 50(a) motions were inadequate, they may still seek review of the verdict under Rule 59. See Pediatrix, 602 F.3d at 546 (noting that \"the text of Rule 59 does not require any pre-verdict motions\"). For these reasons, Finjan's waiver argument fails.\n\nWhile the argument is not waived, we disagree with the merits of Defendants' theory. Defendants claim that our court has held that \"locked\" or disabled products cannot infringe apparatus claims. Their reliance on our precedent is misplaced.\n\nIn Southwest Software, Inc. v. Harlequin Inc., this court affirmed denial of a new trial on infringement, after a verdict of noninfringement, because the evidence showed that the accused software product \"included a manual step which avoided the automatic selection feature of the patented invention even though the code for automatic *1204 selection remained in place.\" 226 F.3d 1280, 1291 (Fed.Cir.2000). Defendants interpret Southwest to hold that locked code cannot infringe. However, the claim at issue in that case was a method that required performance of each claimed step. Id. at 1285. Here, the claims at issue are \"system\" and \"storage medium\" claims, which do not require the performance of any method steps. See NTP, Inc. v. Research in Motion, Ltd., 418 F.3d 1282, 1318 (Fed.Cir.2005) (\"[T]he use of a process necessarily involves doing or performing each of the steps recited. This is unlike use of a system as a whole....\").\n\nDefendants also rely on ACCO Brands, where we overturned a jury verdict of inducement because the patentee failed to \"either point to specific instances of direct infringement or show that the accused device necessarily infringes the patent in suit.\" 501 F.3d at 1313. The asserted apparatus claims covered locking devices with pins in a specific configuration. The accused device could \"be operated in either of two modes,\" one infringing and one not. Id. We explained that, in the absence of any evidence that customers actually operated the device in the infringing mode, direct infringement could not be inferred. Defendants insist that under ACCO Brands, an accused device does not infringe if it \"can be used at any given time in a noninfringing manner.\" Defs.' Principal Br. 33 (citing 501 F.3d at 1313). However, in ACCO Brands, the claim language required the locking device's pin to extend through a slot in a specific configuration. 501 F.3d at 1310. Here, by contrast, Finjan's apparatus claims do not require that the proactive scanning software be configured in a particular way to infringe\u0097only that it be programmed for performing the claimed steps. For example, claim 32 of the '194 patent covers \"[a] system for execution by a server that serves as a gateway to a client, the system comprising: a security policy; an interface ...; a comparator...; and a logical engine....\"\n\nDefendants insist that the asserted claims require actual operability. The asserted \"system\" claims include \"engines,\" such as a \"logical engine\" ('194 patent claim 32), a \"communications engine\" ('780 patent claim 9), and a \"linking engine\" ('822 patent claim 12). Defendants cite the testimony of Finjan's expert Dr. Giovanni Vigna, who stated at trial that an engine \"has an active task to perform,\" and is an \"active component.\" Transcript at 410:6-7, 22. Seizing upon the word \"active,\" Defendants argue that the source code must be \"enabled\" to infringe. However, neither the claim language nor Vigna's testimony supports this contention.\n\nAs we have cautioned, \"in every infringement analysis, the language of the claims, as well as the nature of the accused product, dictates whether an infringement has occurred.\" Fantasy Sports Props. v. Sportsline.com, Inc., 287 F.3d 1108, 1118 (Fed.Cir.2002). Accordingly, we have held that, to infringe a claim that recites capability and not actual operation, an accused device \"need only be capable of operating\" in the described mode. Intel Corp. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 946 F.2d 821, 832 (Fed.Cir.1991). Thus, depending on the claims, \"an accused device may be found to infringe if it is reasonably capable of satisfying the claim limitations, even though it may also be capable of noninfringing modes of operation.\" Hilgraeve Corp. v. Symantec Corp., 265 F.3d 1336, 1343 (Fed. Cir.2001); see also Ball Aerosol & Specialty Container, Inc. v. Ltd. Brands, Inc., 555 F.3d 984, 994 (Fed.Cir.2009) (noting that the \"reasonably capable\" test applies \"only to claim language that specifies that the claim is drawn to capability\").\n\nIn this case, Finjan's non-method claims describe capabilities without requiring that *1205 any software components be \"active\" or \"enabled.\" The system claims recite software components with specific purposes: \"a logical engine for preventing execution\" ('194 patent claim 32), \"a communications engine for obtaining a Downloadable\" ('780 patent claim 9), or \"a linking engine... for forming a sandbox package\" ('822 patent claim 12) (emphases added). The storage medium claims similarly cover capability. Claim 65 of the '194 patent recites a \"computer-readable storage medium storing program code for causing a server that serves as a gateway to a client to perform the steps of: receiving ...; comparing ...; and preventing execution....\" This language does not require that the program code be \"active,\" only that it be written \"for causing\" a server ('194 patent claim 65) or a computer ('780 patent claim 18) to perform certain steps. Vigna's infringement analysis did not contradict this language. He defined an \"engine\" as \"some kind of component whose task is to operate some kind of analysis or transformation.\" Transcript at 410:4-5. Thus, Vigna explained that an engine is a portion of code designed to perform an indicated operation, but is not necessarily unlocked or active. Defendants admit that program code for proactive scanning is \"literally present\" on all accused products. Oral Arg. at 1:53-58, available at http:// oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2009-1576.mp3. Secure's Senior Vice President Michael Gallagher testified that even if a software module was turned off, \"[t]he module is resident in the binary source code that is in the product.\" Transcript at 722:19-22. Thus, it is undisputed that software for performing the claimed functions existed in the products when sold\u0097in the same way that an automobile engine for propulsion exists in a car even when the car is turned off.[2]\n\nWe addressed a similar infringement scenario in Fantasy Sports, where we held that software for playing fantasy football could infringe a claim to a \"computer for playing football.\" 287 F.3d at 1118. The defendants who sold the software argued that because their product was a \"modifiable software tool,\" direct infringement occurred only when users configured it to play games. Id. at 1117. Rejecting this contention, we explained that \"although a user must activate the functions programmed into a piece of software by selecting those options, the user is only activating means that are already present in the underlying software.\" Id. at 1118. Infringement occurred because the code \"was written in such a way as to enable a user of that software to utilize the function... without having to modify that code.\" Id. That analysis applies here. The code for proactive scanning was \"already present\" in Defendants' accused products when sold. There is no evidence that customers needed to modify the underlying code to unlock any software modules. The fact that users needed to \"activate the functions programmed\" by purchasing keys does not detract from or somehow nullify the existence of the claimed structure in the accused software. Therefore, the jury's infringement verdict on the system and media claims was based on a \"legally sufficient evidentiary basis\" and consistent with the \"weight of the evidence.\" Pediatrix, 602 F.3d at 545-46 & n. 9. That portion of the verdict is affirmed.\n\nB. Method Claims\n\nIn addition to the system and storage medium claims, Finjan asserted method claims from each of the three patents in *1206 suit. \"To infringe a method claim, a person must have practiced all steps of the claimed method.\" Lucent Techs. v. Gateway, Inc., 580 F.3d 1301, 1317 (Fed.Cir. 2009).\n\nDefendants claim that the trial record reflects a dearth of evidence on infringement of the method claims. Finjan responds with only two pieces of evidence. First, an engineer at Webwasher AG, Christopher Alme, testified in his deposition that a debug file (later introduced at trial) showed an \"accurate depiction\" of proactive scanning being \"performed\" by Webwasher AG. Transcript at 301:17-304:2. Second, Vigna testified that the same debug file showed performance of the claimed steps. Id. at 364:12-23. Finjan claims that a jury could reasonably infer from these statements that Defendants infringed.\n\nWe disagree with Finjan. The record shows that Alme worked on the Webwasher products in Germany for Webwasher AG, a German company. See id. at 1594:8-13; id. at 1153:6-7 (\"So the product was made in Germany....\"). Therefore, Finjan showed at most that Webwasher AG performed proactive scanning on one occasion in Germany during testing, based on a single debug file. This fails to demonstrate direct infringement in the United States. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a) (defining infringing activities as occurring \"within the United States\"); Gemtron Corp. v. Saint-Gobain Corp., 572 F.3d 1371, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2009) (\"Critically, it is the infringing act\u0097making, using, offering to sell, selling, or importing\u0097that must be within (or into) the United States.\"). Furthermore, Finjan identifies no evidence that Defendants infringed the method claims by testing or operating any copies of the accused products in the United States.[3]\n\nEven construing this evidence most favorably to Finjan, no reasonable jury could have concluded that Defendants infringed the method claims. We therefore reverse the denial of Defendants' motion for JMOL of noninfringement on those claims.\n\nC. \"Addressed to a Client\"\n\nDefendants argue that a new trial is required because the district court erred by failing to construe the term \"addressed to a client.\" Each asserted claim of the '194 patent refers to a \"Downloadable addressed to a client.\" We review claim construction de novo using the methodology in Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303, 1312-19 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc).\n\nThe parties offered competing definitions to the district court. Finjan argued that the phrase has an \"ordinary meaning within the context of the clams.\" Pl.'s Opening Claim Construction Br. 10. Secure defined \"addressed\" as \"containing the IP [Internet Protocol] address of the client computer,\" and \"client\" as \"the computer from which the user is making a request.\" Def.'s Opening Claim Construction Br. 21-23. The district court construed \"addressed to a client\" as having \"its plain and ordinary meaning,\" but also observed that \"the defendant's proposed construction would unjustifiably narrow the term's broad scope, which was not explicitly limited or redefined by the specification.\" Finjan Software, Ltd. v. Secure Computing Corp., No. 06-CV-369, slip op. at 1 & n. 1 (D.Del. Dec.11, 2007). The jury did not receive a construction of \"addressed to a client\" but was told to \"give the rest of the words in the claims their *1207 ordinary meaning.\" Final Jury Instructions 13.\n\nAccording to Defendants, the district court shirked its responsibility to construe a disputed claim term by adopting \"plain and ordinary meaning,\" violating the principles of O2 Micro International Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Technology Co., 521 F.3d 1351 (Fed.Cir.2008). In O2 Micro, we held that the district court erred by assigning the term \"only if\" its plain and ordinary meaning because that definition \"failed to resolve the parties' dispute.\" Id. at 1361. The parties disputed whether \"only if\" allowed for exceptions, but the district court did not answer this question, ruling that the phrase had \"a well-understood definition.\" Id. In the absence of an authoritative construction, the parties argued the scope of the claim term to the jury. Remanding the case, we explained: \"When the parties raise an actual dispute regarding the proper scope of the claims, the court, not the jury, must resolve that dispute.\" Id. at 1360.\n\nNo such error happened here. Unlike O2 Micro, where the court failed to resolve the parties' quarrel, the district court rejected Defendants' construction, which required an IP address. Later, at trial, it prevented the jury from reconstruing the term by stopping Defendants' expert, Dr. Dan Wallach, from repeating to the jury that the asserted claims require an IP address. Defs.' Principal Br. 55. In response, Defendants submitted an offer of proof in which they proposed to have Wallach testify that \"the ordinary meaning of `addressed to a client' ... refers to using the IP address of the client computer.\" Defs.' Offer of Proof Regarding \"Addressed to a Client.\" By doing so, Defendants attempted to resurrect a claim construction that the district court already rejected, without offering a new definition. Restating a previously settled argument does not create an \"actual dispute regarding the proper scope of the claims\" within the meaning of O2 Micro. In this situation, the district court was not obligated to provide additional guidance to the jury. See Verizon Servs. Corp. v. Cox Fibernet Va., Inc., 602 F.3d 1325, 1334 (Fed.Cir. 2010) (finding no O2 Micro problem where the parties \"did not invite the jury to choose between alternative meanings\").\n\nMoreover, even on appeal, Defendants do not propose an alternative construction of \"addressed to a client\" or explain how a different definition would negate infringement of the '194 patent. See SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp., 439 F.3d 1312, 1319 (Fed.Cir.2006) (noting that \"arguments not raised in the opening brief are waived\"). \"We may affirm the jury's findings on infringement... if correction of the errors in a jury instruction on claim construction would not have changed the result, given the evidence presented.\" Teleflex Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am. Corp., 299 F.3d 1313, 1328 (Fed.Cir.2002). Defendants are not entitled to a new trial on this ground.\n\nII. Damages\n\nTo review damages in patent cases, we apply regional circuit law to procedural issues and Federal Circuit law to substantive and procedural issues \"pertaining to patent law.\" Aero Prods. Int'l, Inc. v. Intex Recreation Corp., 466 F.3d 1000, 1016 (Fed.Cir.2006); see also Fiskars, Inc. v. Hunt Mfg. Co., 279 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2002) (noting that Federal Circuit law controls \"the distinctive characteristics of patent damages law\"). \"In reviewing the propriety of a jury verdict, our obligation is to uphold the jury's award if there exists a reasonable basis to do so.\" Motter v. Everest & Jennings, Inc., 883 F.2d 1223, 1230 (3d Cir.1989).\n\n*1208 Finjan sought a hypothetically negotiated royalty based on the factors in Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. U.S. Plywood Corp., 318 F. Supp. 1116, 1120 (S.D.N.Y.1970). The parties presented opposing damages experts. Russell Parr, Finjan's expert, concluded that Finjan was entitled to $10.1 million, computed from an 18% royalty on $49.4 million in Webwasher software sales, an 8% royalty on $3.2 million of Webwasher appliance sales, and an 8% royalty on $12 million of Cyberguard TSP appliances sales. See Transcript at 645:1-647:22. Carl Degen, Defendants' expert, posited a total of $663,000 from a 4% royalty on all products. See id. at 1157:3-11. The jury awarded Finjan $9.18 million, consisting of a 16% royalty on $49,000,000 of Webwasher software sales, an 8% royalty on $3,250,000 of Webwasher appliance sales, and an 8% royalty on $13,500,000 of Cyberguard TSP appliance sales. Joint Special Verdict Form 10.\n\nThe district court denied Defendants' motions for JMOL and new trial, noting that \"a reasonable jury could accept or reject either parties' take on the evidence, including the conflicting expert testimony in this case.\" Memorandum at 23.\n\nA. Royalty Base\n\nDefendants raise two challenges to the royalty base, or total sales, that the jury used to compute damages. First, they claim that the jury misapplied the entire market value rule by using the full value of the accused products. See Lucent, 580 F.3d at 1336 (\"For the entire market value rule to apply, the patentee must prove that the patent-related feature is the basis for customer demand.\") (quotations omitted). Second, they contend that the jury erroneously included sales to the U.S. government.\n\nIn response to the first challenge, Finjan again asserts waiver, arguing that Defendants waived their entire market value rule arguments by not raising them in their post-trial motions, and that they are estopped from challenging the application of the rule because Degen applied the rule himself. This time, we are persuaded that Defendants waived these contentions. In their post-trial motions, Defendants presented multiple objections to the jury's royalty base, including improper inclusion of sales to the government and the argument that locked products cannot infringe (which we have rejected). See Defs.'-Counterclaimants' Mot. for JMOL and New Trial 11-12; Defs.'-Counterclaimants' Opening Br. in Support 38-41. However, nowhere did Defendants raise the entire market value rule or argue that the royalty base for unlocked products should be less than their full sale value. Defendants may not raise these arguments for the first time on appeal. See Srein v. Frankford Trust Co., 323 F.3d 214, 224 n. 8 (3d Cir.2003) (\"We ... will not consider issues that are raised for the first time on appeal absent compelling reasons.\") (quotation omitted). Because we find these arguments waived, we need not address Finjan's estoppel argument.\n\nIn response to Defendants' second challenge, Finjan concedes that Parr incorrectly considered sales to the government. See Transcript at 669:20-21 (\"Q: You also included sales to the federal government? A: Absolutely, yes.\"). This was impermissible because a patentee can recover damages only from the government for patented \"use or manufacture for the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a). Nevertheless, this error does not require a new trial. The district court instructed the jury that sales \"to the United States government should not be included in any damages calculation you perform.\" Final Jury Instructions 42. Jurors are \"presumed to have followed\" the instructions *1209 they were given. Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373, 394, 119 S. Ct. 2090,  144 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1999); see also Citizens Fin. Group, Inc. v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, 383 F.3d 110, 133 (3d Cir.2004) (\"This Court presumes that the jury followed the Court's instructions.\"). Defendants claim that the jury must have ignored these instructions because it accepted Parr's royalty base. In reality, the jury chose different numbers: for the Webwasher software it used a lower base ($49,000,000) than Parr did ($49.4 million), and for the Webwasher and Cyberguard hardware products it applied a higher base ($16,750,000) than Parr's ($15.4 million). While the jury's total base exceeds Parr's, the jury was entitled to choose its own figures from the evidence. Parr explained that infringing hardware sales could exceed his estimates due to Secure's unreported data. See Transcript at 647:1-648:8. Moreover, the record shows only $447,744 in \"proactive module sales\" to the United States. J.A. 5770. Because this total is small relative to the verdict and the jury chose numbers different than Parr's, Defendants fail to rebut the presumption that the jurors followed their charge.\n\nB. Royalty Rates\n\nDefendants next claim that the jury's royalty percentages lack support under the Georgia-Pacific factors. The jury applied an 8% rate to the Webwasher and Cyberguard TSP appliances and a 16% rate to the Webwasher software.\n\nDefendants disagree most with Parr's analysis of Georgia-Pacific factor 8: \"The established profitability of the product made under the patent; its commercial success; and its current popularity.\" 318 F.Supp. at 1120. Under this factor, a wide profit margin for accused products supports a higher reasonable royalty. E.g., Lucent, 580 F.3d at 1335. Parr calculated royalty rates for the infringing products by examining Defendants' financial data from 2004 to 2007, after infringement began. He testified that his goal was to determine product-specific \"operating profit,\" or \"the profit margin of the products in question.\" Transcript at 614:19-23, 617:23-25. Parr's method was to determine the defendant companies' gross profits and then \"eliminate expenses that are not related to the product,\" such as litigation settlement costs and research and development expenses for new (but not existing) products. Id. at 620:4-622:17. After determining operating profit margins for both the software and hardware products, he considered a variety of factors to conclude that the parties in a hypothetical negotiation would have agreed upon a \"one-third/two-third split\" of operating profit margins. Id. at 642:22-644:20. Using this method, Parr concluded that Defendants' operating profit margin was 25% for the hardware products and 55% for the software products, resulting in 8% and 18% royalty rates, respectively.\n\nDefendants assail this methodology, claiming that Parr mistakenly relied on Secure's company-wide profits, not just those for the accused products. They also argue that Parr's adjustments to gross profits were unrealistic, making annual losses look like net gains by disregarding certain costs. Additionally, they fault Parr for ignoring a \"Gross Margin Report\" that showed Secure's product-specific profits, and for using financial data for irrelevant years. Finally, they challenge Parr's projected profit division as arbitrary.\n\nWe conclude that substantial evidence supports the jury's award. Parr admitted that he used Secure's company-wide, instead of product-specific, gross profits to calculate royalty rates. However, he explained to the jury that he found that the gross profit margin for the hardware products *1210 was similar to the company-wide margin (both roughly 70%), so that \"the hardware products ... have a gross profit margin ... that's close.\" Id. at 624:17-625:6. He explained that this allowed him to adjust company-wide gross profits and use the resulting operating profit margin for the hardware products. Parr thus provided more than just a conclusory opinion, on which the jury was entitled to rely. Defendants' expert Degen agreed that company profit was relevant, saying: \"Mr. Parr and I both rely, at least he tries to rely on product-specific profit. But I think it is instructive to just take a look at what the companies that were making the accused product have earned over time.\" Id. at 1118:10-15. For the software product, Parr set aside company profit and relied instead on testimony by a Secure executive, who stated that Secure's gross profit margin on software was 99%. Id. at 626:2-18, 683:1-18. While this departs from his methods for the hardware products, Parr again explained his analysis and based it on testimonial evidence.\n\nParr also justified his method of discounting certain expenses in Secure's financial statements to calculate operating profit. Parr claimed that he discounted 80% of Secure's research and development costs for future products, for example, because Secure's research expenses for unrelated products should not affect the value it obtained from using the patented invention. Id. at 621:1-8. Discounting these expenses significantly changed Defendants' operating profits: on cross-examination, Parr admitted that for 2006, Secure's financial statements reflected a loss of $17.8 million, but his calculations converted this into a profit of $28 million. Id. at 662:16-25. However, we cannot foreclose the jury from relying on Parr's reasoning, which reflected adjustments to remove one-time costs and other expenses not related to product manufacture, sales, and marketing. Moreover, while Degen believed Parr's adjustments to be \"wrong,\" he too made adjustments to gross profit and told the jury that \"the differences between us in terms of those adjustments are relatively small.\" Id. at 1122:1-17.\n\nDefendants' remaining objections to the profits analysis do not warrant retrial. They claim that Parr compiled his profit data from irrelevant years. Defs. Principal Br. 47-48. But Parr explained that he looked at profit margins only after Cyberguard began infringing sales, which was the date on which the hypothetical negotiation would have taken place. Transcript at 658:10-13. Parr's use of the actual profit margins that both Secure and Cyberguard experienced on products after that date was simply as a reflection of the profits the parties might have anticipated in calculating a reasonable royalty in the hypothetical negotiation. His testimony was subject to cross-examination, and the Defendants did not object to the use of actual profits in general as a basis on which to gauge expected profits in the hypothetical negotiation. The jury was free to consider Parr's testimony both on direct and on cross-examination. Parr disregarded a Gross Margin Report showing Secure's profits for Webwasher products for certain periods, but explained that he did so because the report did not separate profit margins for hardware and software. Transcript at 667:14-20. Additionally, the jury saw and considered the report because Defendants introduced it through Degen's testimony. Id. at 1129:20-1130:24. Finally, Defendants' objection to Parr's \"one-third/two-third split\" of operating profit margins as arbitrary is also unpersuasive. Parr considered the custom in the industry, history of prior licenses, competitiveness of the parties, and the importance of the patented technology, among other factors, in concluding that the parties would have agreed *1211 that Finjan was entitled to 33% of the operating profit margin. Id. at 637:3-6; 643:8-644:20. Defendants' expert testified that the parties would have instead settled on Finjan receiving 25% of the operating profit margin. Id. at 1151:4-8. In explaining this \"minor difference\" between his opinion and Parr's, Degen attributed it to the fact that \"[Parr] overestimates the level of competitiveness between the two firms.\" Id. at 1254:20-1255:1. In short, both parties' positions on profits were based on evidence and reasoned expert opinion, and we cannot second-guess the jury's independent views of either.\n\nThe parties also dispute Georgia-Pacific factor 11: \"The extent to which the infringer has made use of the invention; and any evidence probative of the value of that use.\" 318 F.Supp. at 1120. Defendants argue that the jury ignored the fact that not all customers enabled proactive scanning modules, and that \"if no users activated modules containing proactive scanning, no revenue for that product was properly attributable to the patented invention.\" Defs.' Principal Br. 49. This argument confuses use by customers with use by infringers. Factor 11 looks to \"how often a patented invention has been used by infringers.\" Lucent, 580 F.3d at 1333 (emphasis added). Here, the accused direct infringers are Defendants, not their customers. Because Defendants included proactive scanning on every accused product, their \"use\" encompassed all of their sales, regardless of customer activation. Degen noted that even if Cyberguard TSP purchasers did not unlock the proactive scanning modules, Secure obtained advertising value from those features. Transcript at 1116:5-11.\n\nNext, Defendants address factors 10 and 13, which relate to \"[t]he nature of the patented invention\" and \"[t]he portion of the realizable profit that should be credited to the invention.\" 318 F.Supp. at 1120. They argue again that their profits are not tied to proactive scanning but also include other software modules. Indeed, in Lucent we overturned a damages verdict for a software component, partly due to factors 10 and 13, because the component was a \"tiny feature\" and \"[t]he parties presented little evidence relating to Factor 13.\" 580 F.3d at 1332-33. In this case, however, the jury heard evidence on which it could conclude that the patented inventions were far from being tiny features in the accused products. Parr testified that, based on Secure's internal documents, proactive scanning was \"fundamentally important to the product,\" Transcript at 628:11-16, while Degen agreed after reviewing Secure and Finjan promotional materials that \"[i]t's important technology. It was perceived as the next wave,\" id. at 1117:10-18. Those materials included statements emphasizing Secure's ability to \"proactively protect\" customers with \"Webwasher Proactive Scanning.\" From this evidence, the jury could infer that a substantial fraction of the accused products' profits stemmed from proactive scanning.\n\nFinally, Defendants claim that the jury failed to consider factor 1: \"The royalties received by the patentee for the licensing of the patent in suit, proving or tending to prove an established royalty.\" 318 F.Supp. at 1120. Defendants identify one license: an agreement between Finjan and Microsoft in which Microsoft acquired a worldwide license to Finjan's complete patent portfolio for a lump sum of $8 million. Defs. Principal Br. 51. In contrast, Finjan received $9.18 million for Defendants' infringement of three patents. We have recently reiterated that use of past patent licenses under factors 1 and 2 must account for differences in the technologies and economic circumstances of the contracting parties. E.g., ResQNet.com, Inc. *1212 v. Lansa, Inc., 594 F.3d 860, 870-73 (Fed. Cir.2010) (per curiam); see also Wordtech Sys. v. Integrated Networks Solutions, Inc., 609 F.3d 1308, 1319-20 (Fed.Cir. 2010). Here, Finjan noted multiple differences between the Finjan-Microsoft licensing scenario and a hypothetical negotiation with Defendants. Parr explained that Finjan did not compete with Microsoft but does compete against Secure; that Finjan received significant intangible value from Microsoft's endorsements of Finjan; and that the license involved a lump sum instead of a running royalty. These differences permitted the jury to properly discount the Microsoft license.\n\nFinjan also introduced evidence under other Georgia-Pacific factors that Defendants ignore on appeal. The jury heard evidence that Finjan tends not to license its proactive scanning patents to competitors (factor 4), and that Secure competes directly with Finjan in the same line of business (factor 5). Finjan also noted that the patents do not expire until 2017 (the '194 and '780 patents) or 2021 (the '822 patent), and that long expiration dates support higher hypothetical royalty rates, particularly in the software industry (factor 7).\n\nDespite potential flaws in Finjan's damages theory, \"[t]he jury was entitled to hear the expert testimony and decide for itself what to accept or reject.\" i4i Limited Partnership, Infrastructure for Information Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 598 F.3d 831, 856 (Fed.Cir.2010). \"In setting damages, the jury's function is to weigh contradictory evidence, to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and to resolve factual disputes,\" C&F Packing Co. v. IBP, Inc., 224 F.3d 1296, 1304 (Fed.Cir.2000)\u0097provided that the record does not \"rest on faulty assumptions and a lack of reliable economic testimony,\" Oiness v. Walgreen Co., 88 F.3d 1025, 1032 (Fed.Cir.1996). In this case, we conclude that the jury's choice was \"within the range encompassed by the record as a whole.\" Unisplay, S.A. v. Am. Elec. Sign Co., 69 F.3d 512, 519 (Fed.Cir. 1995). While Defendants insist that the jury blindly adopted Parr's analysis, ultimately the jury awarded lower total damages than Parr recommended ($9.18 million versus $10.1 million), including a lower royalty rate on Webwasher software sales (16% versus 18%). Because Defendants have not shown that the verdict is bereft of \"a reasonable basis\" in the record, Motter, 883 F.2d at 1230, we affirm the denial of Defendants' motions for JMOL or new trial on damages.\n\nIII. Finjan's Cross-Appeal on Damages\n\nAfter trial, Finjan sought to amend the judgment to include damages for infringing sales that the jury did not consider and that preceded entry of the permanent injunction. The district court granted Finjan additional damages by multiplying the jury's royalty rates against previously uncalculated sales but, without explanation, limited the accounting \"to only those additional infringing sales that occurred up until the date of entry of the judgment in this case,\" or March 28, 2008. Memorandum at 25 & n. 15. The court entered the injunction on August 28, 2009\u0097roughly seventeen months after it entered judgment.\n\nFinjan claims entitlement to damages for this seventeen-month period. We agree. Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284, \"the court shall award ... in no event less than a reasonable royalty,\" and \"[w]hen damages are not found by a jury, the court shall assess them\" (emphases added). \"Although courts have broad discretion in determining appropriate relief for patent infringement,... injunctions and damages must be tailored to the circumstances and be correlatively determined.\" Carborundum *1213 Co. v. Molten Metal Equip. Innovations, Inc., 72 F.3d 872, 881 (Fed.Cir.1995) (quotation omitted). Accordingly, we have noted that a patentee is \"not fully compensated\" if \"the damages award did not include future lost sales.\" Id. at 882; see also Fresenius USA, Inc. v. Baxter Int'l, Inc., 582 F.3d 1288, 1303 (Fed.Cir.2009) (\"A damages award for pre-verdict sales of the infringing product does not fully compensate the patentee because it fails to account for post-verdict sales of repair parts.\"). Therefore, the district court should have awarded compensation for any infringement prior to the injunction.\n\nDefendants' sole response is that Finjan waived its right to further damages because its Amended Complaint sought only \"such damages as it shall prove at trial\" Defs.' Response & Reply Br. 35 (emphasis added). However, nothing in this statement forfeited the right to prove damages for sales that occurred after trial. Finjan's Amended Complaint also sought \"[s]uch further and other relief as the Court and/or jury may deem proper and just.\" Am. Compl. for Patent Infringement 6. Moreover, Defendants identify no prejudice due to the timing of Finjan's motion. Like the district court, we reject Defendants' waiver argument. Memorandum at 25 n. 15.\n\nWe therefore remand for the district court to determine appropriate damages for the period from March 29, 2008 to August 28, 2009.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the denial of Defendants' motions for JMOL or new trial on infringement of Finjan's system and storage medium claims, but reverse the denial of their motion for JMOL of noninfringement of the method claims. We affirm the denial of Defendants' motions for JMOL or new trial on damages. Finally, we remand for the district court to assess post-judgment, pre-injunction damages.\n\nAFFIRMED-IN-PART, REVERSED-IN-PART, and REMANDED\n\nCOSTS\n\nEach party shall bear its own costs.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] For convenience, we refer to the combined trial transcripts as \"Transcript.\"\n\n[2] Defendants have not argued that the Webwasher software download product is not a \"system\" or \"computer-readable storage medium.\"\n\n[3] Finjan does not argue that the accused products were imported after being \"made by a process patented in the United States,\" which could raise liability under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(g).", "annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 70}, {"start": 71, "end": 111}, {"start": 112, "end": 137}, {"start": 138, "end": 171}, {"start": 172, "end": 196},

Texas, Houston Division.\n\nOctober 14, 2005.\n*748 Pen Register, Defendant, Pro se.\n\nOPINION\n\nSTEPHEN WM. SMITH, United States Magistrate Judge.\n\nAs part of an ongoing criminal investigation, the government seeks a court order compelling a cell phone company to disclose records of a customer's cell phone use. Among the records sought is \"cell site data,\" which reveals the user's physical location while the phone is turned on. By order dated September 2, 2005, the court granted the application in large part, authorizing the continued use of a pen register/trap and trace device and disclosure of certain customer records including historical cell site data. However, the order denied access to prospective cell site information, for reasons explained more fully in this opinion.\n\nThe underlying order and application have been sealed at the government's request, in order not to jeopardize the ongoing criminal investigation. This opinion will not be sealed, because it concerns a matter of statutory interpretation which does not hinge on the particulars of the underlying investigation. The issue explored here has serious implications for *749 the balance between privacy and law enforcement, and is a matter of first impression in this circuit as well as most others.[1]\n\nFollowing its standard practice in this district, the government has combined its request for subscriber records with an application to install a pen register and trap/trace device on the target phone. Basically, a pen register is a device or process which records the telephone numbers of outgoing calls; the trap and trace device captures the telephone numbers of incoming calls. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3127. Among the most commonly used law enforcement techniques,[2] a pen/trap order authorizes real-time electronic monitoring of a telephone user's calls (excluding content) for a limited duration, typically 60 days. Id. at \u00a7 3123(c).\n\nTo assist this monitoring effort, the government seeks access to subscriber records maintained by the phone company pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(c). Among the records sought is \"the location of cell site/sector (physical address) at call origination (for outbound calling), call termination (for incoming calls), and, if reasonably available, during the progress of a call.\" Sealed Application, at \u00b6 21. Also sought is information regarding the strength, angle, and timing of the caller's signal measured at two or more cell sites, as well as other system information such as a listing of all cell towers in the market area, switching technology, protocols, and network architecture. Armed with this information, collectively known as \"cell site data,\" investigators are often able to locate suspects and fugitives. The application makes this purpose explicit in a paragraph/sentence of clumsy boilerplate:\n\n[T]he device characteristics (such as model and capabilities), network characteristics (such as a provider's System and Base Identity listings, which are FCC assigned numbers used to identify providers and to subdivide their service markets, and communications protocol, e.g. GSM, CDMA, TDMA, or iDEN and Cellular vs. PCS service band), cell site listings (physical locations and numbering of towers), cell site activations and facings (when, and as, accessed by the Target Device), control channels and subchannels (the non-content communications signals that coordinate calls and help determine when a cell is switched or \"handed-off\"), signal strengths between the device and the cell site (used to estimate distance and determine when a cell site \"hand-off\" is necessary and possible), and other system information, when coupled with the subscriber records for all calls identified by the pen register and trap and trace device may provide the general geographic location of the Target Device and, thus, may allow investigators to identify a suspect's location.\n\nSealed Application, at \u00b6 20.\n\nThe issue presented here is what legal standard the government must satisfy to compel disclosure of such prospective or \"real-time\" cell site data. More particularly, is this location information merely another form of subscriber record accessible *750 upon a showing of \"specific and articulable facts\" under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(d), as the government contends? Or does this type of surveillance require a more exacting standard, such as probable cause under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41?\n\n1. Technology\n\nUnavoidably, some familiarity with cell phone technology is necessary to address this issue. A cell phone is a sophisticated two-way radio with a low-power transmitter that operates in a network of cell sites.[3] \"Cell\" refers to geographic regions often illustrated as hexagons, resembling a bee's honeycomb; a \"cell site\" is where the radio transceiver and base station controller are located (at the point three hexagons meet). Cell phones and base stations communicate with each other on frequencies called channels. Two frequencies are paired to create a channel; one for transmitting, one for receiving. Channels that carry only cell system data are called control channels. The control channel is a frequency shared by the phone and the base station to communicate information for setting up calls and channel changing when the user moves from one cell to another. By comparison, voice channels are those paired frequencies which handle a call's traffic, be it voice or data, as well as signaling information about the call itself. The cell site sends and receives traffic from the cell phones in its geographic area to a mobile telecommunications switching office, which handles all phone connections and controls all base stations in a given region.\n\nWhen a cell phone is powered up, it acts as a scanning radio, searching through a list of control channels for the strongest signal. The cell phone re-scans every seven seconds or when the signal strength weakens, regardless of whether a call is placed. The cell phone searches for a five-digit number known as the System Identification Code assigned to service providers. After selecting a channel, the cell phone identifies itself by sending its programmed codes which identify the phone, the phone's owner, and the service provider. These codes include an Electronic Serial Number (a unique 32-bit number programmed into the phone by the manufacturer), and a Mobile Identification Number, a 10-digit number derived from the phone's number.\n\nThe cell site relays these codes to the mobile telecommunications switching office in a process known as registration. The registration process is explained in the Department of Justice's Electronic Surveillance Manual:\n\nCellular telephones that are powered on will automatically register or re-register with a cellular tower as the phone travels within the provider's service area. The registration process is the technical means by which the network identifies the subscriber, validates the account and determines where to route call traffic. This exchange occurs on a dedicated control channel that is clearly separate from that used for call content (i.e. audio) \u0097 which occurs on a separate dedicated channel.\n\nU.S. Dep't of Justice, Electronic Surveillance Manual, at 178-79 n. 41 (rev. June 2005)[4] (emphasis supplied).\n\n*751 It should be emphasized that cell site data transmitted during the registration process \"are not dialed or otherwise controlled by the cellular telephone user.\" Id. at 40. This registration process automatically occurs even while the cell phone is idle. Moving from one service area to another triggers the registration process anew. The cell site can even initiate registration on its own by sending a signal to the cell phone causing the phone to transmit and identify itself.\n\nWhen the switching office gets an incoming call, it sends a \"page\" to the cell phone over the control channel. When the cell phone responds, the switching office assigns a voice channel to carry the actual conversation; at that point the control channel drops off. The speaker's voice is converted into electronic digits (i.e. a series of 1s and 0s), which are then compressed for transmission over the voice channel.\n\nIn summary, a cell phone is (among other things) a radio transmitter that automatically announces its presence to a cell tower via a radio signal over a control channel which does not itself carry the human voice. By a process of triangulation from various cell towers, law enforcement is able to track the movements of the target phone, and hence locate a suspect using that phone.[5]\n\n2. Statutes\n\nThe basic contours of electronic surveillance law were fixed by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (\"ECPA\"). Pub.L. No. 99-508, 100 Stat. 1848 (1986). The ECPA comprised three titles. Title I amended the 1968 federal wiretap statute[6] to cover electronic communications. The Wiretap Act had imposed several additional requirements for lawful interception of a telephone conversation, beyond a judicial finding of probable cause: a wiretap is authorized only for specified crimes, for a limited duration, as a last resort, with minimized interception of innocent conversations, notice to targets, and extensive judicial oversight. See generally 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518. The ECPA amendments extended these restrictions to interception of electronic communications, with certain significant exceptions. This portion of the ECPA has no bearing on the issue before us, except to illustrate the full panoply of protections given to the content of private conversations under the Fourth Amendment; indeed, one commentator has referred to these wiretap requirements collectively as a form of \"super-warrant.\" Orin S. Kerr, Internet Surveillance Law After the USA PATRIOT Act: The Big Brother That Isn't, 97 NW. U.L.REV. 607, 630 (Winter 2003).\n\nAnother portion of ECPA's Title I concerns mobile tracking devices. Pub.L. No. 99-508, Title I, \u00a7 108(a), 100 Stat. 1858 (Oct. 21, 1986) (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3117). The purpose of this provision was narrow: to authorize monitoring of tracking devices which may move across district lines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3117(a). The ECPA was not intended to affect the legal standard for the issuance of orders authorizing these devices. See H.R. Rep. 99- 647, *752 at 60 (1986). A Rule 41 probable cause warrant was (and is) the standard procedure for authorizing the installation and use of mobile tracking devices. See United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705, 720, 104 S. Ct. 3296, 82 L. Ed. 2d 530 n. 6 (1984) (warrantless monitoring of beeper in private residence violates Fourth Amendment); United States v. Mixon, 717 F. Supp. 1169 (E.D.La.), aff'd, 891 F.2d 904 (5th Cir.1989); U.S. v. In re Application for Tracking Devices on a White Ford Truck, 155 F.R.D. 401, 403 (D.Mass.1994); see also J. CARR & P. BELLIA, THE LAW OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE \u00a7 4:83, at 4-199 (West 2004). Title I of the ECPA also defines the term \"tracking device\" to mean \"an electronic or mechanical device which permits the tracking of the movement of a person or thing.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3117(b). This broad definition, which is cross referenced in other portions of the ECPA, carries important implications for cell site data access, to which we will return below.\n\nTitle II of the ECPA created a new chapter of the criminal code dealing with access to stored communications and transaction records. Pub.L. No. 99-508, 100 Stat. 1848, 1860 (1986) (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701 et seq.). This portion of the statute is commonly known as the \"Stored Communications Act\" or \"SCA.\" The core is \u00a7 2703, authorizing government access to stored communications or transaction records in the hands of third party service providers. There are three categories of information, each with differing access requirements: (a) contents of wire or electronic communications in electronic storage; (b) contents of wire or electronic communications in a remote computing service; and (c) subscriber records concerning electronic communication service or remote computing service. The first two categories of content information generally require either a search warrant under Rule 41 or notice to the subscriber or customer. The third category of information \u0097 subscriber records \u0097 may be obtained by a court order upon proof of \"specific and articulable facts showing ... reasonable grounds to believe that ... the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(d). This \"specific and articulable facts\" threshold, the result of a 1994 amendment, imposes an intermediate standard between an administrative subpoena and a probable cause warrant.[7]\n\nTitle III of the ECPA covers pen registers and trap/trace devices. Pub.L. No. 99-508, 100 Stat. 1848, 1873 (1986) (codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3121-27). This portion of the Act will be referred to as the \"Pen/Trap Statute.\" A \"pen register\" is a device that records the numbers dialed for outgoing calls made from the target phone.[8] A trap and trace device captures the numbers of calls made to the target phone. The Supreme Court held in Smith *753 v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 99 S. Ct. 2577, 61 L. Ed. 2d 220 (1979), that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the telephone numbers she dials. Consequently, the legal hurdle for pen/trap surveillance is very low: a law enforcement officer need only certify that information likely to be obtained by the pen register or trap and trace device \"is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3122(b)(2). Upon that certification, the court must enter an ex parte order. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3123(a)(1), (2); see also J. CARR & P. BELLIA, THE LAW OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE \u00a7 1:26, at 1-25 (West 2004) (\"In other words, the judge need not \u0097 and, indeed, cannot \u0097 independently assess the factual predicate for the government officials' certification\").\n\nDespite frequent amendment, the basic architecture of electronic surveillance law erected by the ECPA remains in place to this day. This statutory scheme has four broad categories, arranged from highest to lowest legal process for obtaining court approval:\n\n\u0095 wiretaps, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2522 (super-warrant);\n\n\u0095 tracking devices, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3117 (Rule 41 probable cause);\n\n\u0095 stored communications and subscriber records, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(d) (specific and articulable facts);\n\n\u0095 pen register/trap and trace, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3121-3127 (certified relevance).\n\nWith this background in mind, we turn to the question at hand: what legal process is required for the government to collect prospective cell site data? In other words, which category of electronic surveillance law covers such location information?\n\n3. Prospective Cell Site Data as Tracking Information\n\nOur analysis begins with the tracking device category, which appears at first glance to provide the most likely fit for cell site location monitoring. In its first opinion dealing with the ECPA, the Fifth Circuit cautioned that rigorous attention must be paid to statutory definitions when interpreting this complex statute: \"Understanding the Act requires understanding and applying its many technical terms as defined by the Act, as well as engaging in painstaking, methodical analysis.\" Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service, 36 F.3d 457, 461 (5th Cir.1994).\n\nThe ECPA's definition of tracking device is concise and straight-forward:\n\nAs used in this section, the term \"tracking device\" means an electronic or mechanical device which permits the tracking of the movement of a person or thing.\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3117(b). Aside from its welcome brevity, the definition is striking for its breadth. Note that a device is covered even though it may not have been intended or designed to track movement; it is enough if the device merely \"permits\" tracking. Nor does the definition suggest that a covered device can have no function other than tracking movement. Finally, there is no specification of how precise the tracking must be. Whether from room to room, house to house, neighborhood to neighborhood, or city to city, this unqualified definition draws no distinction.\n\nThe government contends that this interpretation of \"tracking device\" is too expansive, and points to the Senate Report on the ECPA which contained a glossary of technological terms defining \"electronic tracking devices\" as one-way radio \"homing\" devices. S.Rep. No. 541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., at 10 (1986), reprinted at 1986 *754 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3564. But even if this glossary definition accurately depicted the Senate's working understanding of the term in 1986, that definition never made it into the United States Code. So, if the government is correct that the glossary definition is narrower than \u00a7 3117(b), the only permissible inference is that Congress intended \"tracking device\" to have the broader meaning. Far from supporting the government's position, the glossary definition undermines it.\n\nBy adopting the broader language, Congress may simply have been anticipating future advances in tracking technology. Such advances have indeed come to pass:\n\nTracking devices have progressed a long way. Most agencies now have sophisticated tracking devices that use cell site towers or satellites.... These types of tracking devices are usually monitored from the law enforcement agency's office. Through the use of computers, a signal is sent to the tracking device (it is pinged), and the tracking device responds. The signal is picked up using cellular telephone cell sites or satellites. The location of the tracker, and therefore the vehicle, is determined through triangulation and a computer monitor at the agency office shows the location of the vehicle on a map. These tracking devices are very accurate, and can differentiate between a vehicle traveling on an interstate highway or the feeder (service) road. The tracking devices will also provide the direction of travel and the speed the vehicle is traveling.\n\nRobert Stabe, Electronic Surveillance \u0097 Non-Wiretap, \u00a7 3.31, in U.S. Dep't of Justice, Federal Narcotics Prosecutions.[9] (emphasis supplied). Thus, even traditional tracking devices such as beepers on vehicles are now monitored via radio signals using the very same cell phone towers used to transmit cell site data. Given this convergence in technology, the distinction between cell site data and information gathered by a tracking device has practically vanished. While Congress may not have known back in 1986 that a cell phone would come to be used as a tracking device, the broad language of \u00a7 3117(b) certainly left open that possibility.\n\nWhile the cell phone was not originally conceived as a tracking device, law enforcement converts it to that purpose by monitoring cell site data. As with a tracking device, this process is usually surreptitious and unknown to the phone user, who may not even be on the phone. The technique was described in United States v. Forest, 355 F.3d 942 (6th Cir.2004), where DEA agents lost visual contact with two individuals under wiretap surveillance for cocaine trafficking:\n\nIn order to reestablish visual contact, a DEA agent dialed Garner's cellular phone (without allowing it to ring) several times that day and used Sprint's computer data to determine which transmission towers were being \"hit\" by Garner's phone. This \"cell-site data\" revealed the general location of Garner. From this data, DEA agents determined that Garner had traveled to the Cleveland area and then returned to the area of Youngstown/Warren.\n\nId. at 947.[10] Garner's cell phone functioned no differently than a traditional *755 beeper device, the only difference being that it was on his person instead of attached to his vehicle.\n\nThe government resists categorizing cell site data in the hands of service providers as information from a tracking device, because it does not provide \"detailed\" location information. This argument is unpersuasive for several reasons. Textually, \u00a7 3117(b) does not distinguish between general vicinity tracking and detailed location tracking. Even if the statute had hinted at such a limitation, technological innovation would quickly render it obsolete. In December 1997, the Federal Communications Commission issued final \"Enhanced 911\" (E911) rules requiring cellular service providers to upgrade their systems to identify more precisely the longitude and latitude of mobile units making emergency 911 calls. By the end of 2005, carriers using handset-based location technology will be required to locate cell phones within 50 meters for 67% of calls, and 150 meters for 95% of calls. See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.18(h) (2005). Location based services (LBS) are part of the next wave of cell phone features coming to the wireless marketplace. See generally David J. Phillips, Beyond Privacy: Confronting Locational Surveillance in Wireless Communication, 8 COMM. L. & POL'Y 1 (Winter 2003). A recent Google search retrieved a website[11] advertising itself as a \"leading provider of wireless location-based services (LBS) that leverage an individual's location to deliver customized, actionable information\" such as \"last known locations,\" \"location-based alerts,\" and \"proximity-based points of interest.\" This inexorable combination of market and regulatory stimuli ensures that cell phone tracking will become more precise with each passing year.\n\nThe DOJ has not been so circumspect about applying the \"tracking device\" label in its own Electronic Surveillance Manual. Discussing an electronic device known as a \"trigger-fish,\" which enables law enforcement to gather cell site data directly, without the assistance of the service provider, the manual repeatedly uses the term \"tracking device.\"[12] Yet the trigger-fish identifies the location of the user by exactly the same triangulation method that the government would apply to cell site data obtained from the cell phone company. If the tracking device label is warranted in the one case, it is warranted in the other. The label should not change merely because the equipment used to obtain the tracking data belongs to the service provider rather than law enforcement.\n\nThe government posits a slippery slope of adverse consequences unintended by Congress if cell phones could be classified *756 as tracking devices under \u00a7 3117(b). For example, the government notes that land-line phones, computers, and even credit cards can sometimes reveal the user's location, and these things have never been considered tracking devices. But learning a credit card user's location at the point of purchase is far different from continuously monitoring a person's movement from place to place in real time. Section 3117(b) covers only those devices which permit the \"tracking of the movement of a person or object.\" (emphasis supplied). Cell site data allows continuous tracking of actual movement, i.e., change of location over time; the examples cited by the government do not.\n\nIn the same vein, the government argues that such a broad interpretation of \u00a7 3117(b) \"would eviscerate privacy protection under the Wiretap Act and the SCA for most communications now deemed electronic communications.\" Gov't Memorandum dated August 23, 2005, at 14. This argument rests on a fallacy \u0097 i.e., that classifying cell site data as tracking information means that a cell phone must be regarded solely as a tracking device for all purposes, so that any form of communication from a cell phone ipso facto becomes a communication from a tracking device. Such reasoning ignores the multi-functional nature of the modern cell phone. This device delivers many different types of communication: live conversations, voice mail, pages, text messages, e-mail, alarms, internet, video, photos, dialing, signaling, etc. The legal standard for government access depends entirely upon the type of communication involved. Congress has decreed the highest protection for the contents of live conversations acquired via wiretap, intermediate protection for stored electronic communications, and the least protection for telephone numbers dialed. The legal threshold for each type of communication is different, notwithstanding that a cell phone transmits them all. It would surely make no sense to impose the wiretap requirements upon a pen/trap application merely because the cell phone can be used to intercept live conversations; it makes no more sense to impose the tracking device requirements for access to other types of cell phone communications unrelated to physical location.\n\nIronically, it is the government's position that threatens to undermine the federal statutory scheme for electronic surveillance. As we have seen, a cell phone can readily be converted by law enforcement to function as a tracking device, employing much the same technology as the modern beeper or transponder. Under the government's theory, law enforcement could simply install cell phones in place of the beepers currently underneath vehicles and inside drum barrels, and eliminate forever the need to obtain a Rule 41 search warrant for tracking surveillance. As explained more fully in the next part, this would violate congressional intent by collapsing the barriers between the distinct categories of electronic surveillance erected by Congress in the ECPA.\n\nA word about the Fourth Amendment implications of cell site tracking is in order here. The government contends that probable cause should never be required for cell phone tracking because there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in cell site location data, analogizing such information to the telephone numbers found unprotected in Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 99 S. Ct. 2577, 61 L. Ed. 2d 220 (1979). The Sixth Circuit rejected that analogy in United States v. Forest, 355 F.3d 942, 951-52 (6th Cir.2004). Unlike dialed telephone numbers, cell site data is not \"voluntarily conveyed\" by the user to the phone company. As we have seen, it is transmitted automatically during the registration process, entirely independent of the *757 user's input, control, or knowledge. Sometimes, as in Forest, cell site data is triggered by law enforcement's dialing of the particular number. 355 F.3d at 951. For these reasons the Sixth Circuit was persuaded that Smith did not extend to cell site data, but rejected the defendant's constitutional claim on the narrower ground that the surveillance took place on public highways, where there is no legitimate expectation of privacy. Id. at 951-52 (citing United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276, 281,  103 S. Ct. 1081, 75 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1983)).\n\nFurther support for a recognizable privacy interest in caller location information is provided by the Wireless Communication and Public Safety Act of 1999. Pub.L. No. 106-81, \u00a7 5, 113 Stat. 1288 (Oct. 26, 1999) (codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 222(f)). This legislation authorized the deployment of a nation-wide 9-1-1 emergency service for wireless phone users, called \"Enhanced 9-1-1.\" Section 5 of the bill amended the Telecommunications Act to extend privacy protection for the call location information of cell phone users:\n\n(f) Authority to Use Wireless Location Information. \u0097\n\nFor purposes of subsection (c)(1) of this section, without the express prior authorization of the customer, a customer shall not be considered to have approved the use or disclosure of or access to \u0097\n\n(1) call location information concerning the user of a commercial mobile service (as such term is defined in section 332(d) of this title), other than in accordance with subsection (d)(4) of this section; ...\n\n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 222(f). In other words, location information is a special class of customer information, which can only be used or disclosed in an emergency situation, absent express prior consent by the customer. Based on this statute, a cell phone user may very well have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in his call location information.\n\nFor purposes of this decision it is unnecessary to draw the line between permissible and impermissible warrantless monitoring of cell site data. As in any tracking situation, it is impossible to know in advance whether the requested phone monitoring will invade the target's Fourth Amendment rights. The mere possibility of such an invasion is sufficient to require the prudent prosecutor to seek a Rule 41 search warrant. Because the government cannot demonstrate that cell site tracking could never under any circumstance implicate Fourth Amendment privacy rights, there is no reason to treat cell phone tracking differently from other forms of tracking under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3117, which routinely require probable cause.\n\n4. Prospective Cell Site Data and Other ECPA Surveillance Categories\n\nHaving concluded that prospective cell site data is properly categorized as tracking device information under \u00a7 3117, the question arises whether such data may not also be obtainable under other provisions of the ECPA. In other words, do the four broad categories of the ECPA overlap, such that location information obtainable from a \u00a7 3117 tracking device is simultaneously obtainable under the Wiretap Act, the SCA, or the Pen/Trap Statute? The answer to this question is clearly \"no.\"\n\nTwo of the categories may be discarded at the outset. The minimal pen/trap standard does not authorize access to cell site data; Congress made that much clear in the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (\"CALEA\"):\n\n[W]ith regard to information acquired solely pursuant to the authority for pen registers and trap and trace devices (as defined in section 3127 of Title 18), such *758 call-identifying information shall not include any information that may disclose the physical location of the subscriber (except to the extent that the location may be determined from the telephone number).\n\n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a)(2) (emphasis supplied).[13]\n\nNor is the super-warrant wiretap standard applicable here, because the government is not seeking to intercept the contents of a phone user's communication. Cell site data does not reflect the \"contents\" of a communication as that term is defined by the Wiretap Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(8) (\"any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication\"). For the same reason, the first two parts of the SCA authorizing disclosure of the contents of stored communications do not apply, because the SCA incorporates the same definition of \"contents.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2711(1). The only remaining possibility for prospective cell site data is the SCA subscriber records category under \u00a7 2703(c). The government's application understandably invokes this authority, with its lesser \"specific and articulable facts\" threshold. However, neither the text nor the structure of the SCA supports the government's contention.\n\nCarefully reviewing the language of the SCA, as Steve Jackson instructs, we find no mention of cell site data in the laundry list of basic subscriber information contained in \u00a7 2703(c)(2). The list does include \"address,\" but this plainly refers to the subscriber's nominal residence for billing or contact purposes, rather than the physical location(s) where the mobile phone is used. In order to be accessible under the SCA, therefore, cell site data must fit within the broader category of transactional information referred to in \u00a7 2703(c)(1):\n\n(c) Records concerning electronic communication service or remote computing service. \u0097 (1) A governmental entity may require a provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service to disclose a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber or customer of such service (not including the contents of communications).\n\nThe SCA does not define the term \"record or other information pertaining to a subscriber or customer of such service,\" nor has any reported case interpreted the phrase. The legislative history is only slightly more helpful, noting that \"the information involved is information about the customer's use of the service.\" S.Rep. No. 99-541, at 38, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3592.\n\nHowever, the ECPA does define other terms within \u00a7 2703(c)(1). The records to be disclosed must pertain to the subscriber's use of the provider's electronic communication service.[14] The term \"electronic communication service\" is defined as \"any service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510(15), 2711(1) (emphasis added). The issue now becomes whether tracking device information, such as prospective cell site data, may constitute a record pertaining to \"wire or *759 electronic communications,\" as those terms are defined by the ECPA. If not, then access to such information is not authorized under the SCA.\n\nHere at last the statute ceases to be so murky, yielding more definitive answers. Tracking device information such as cell site data is plainly not a form of electronic communication at all. \"Electronic communication\" is defined as follows:\n\n[A]ny transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photo electronic or photo optical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce, but does not include \u0097\n\n* * * * * *\n\n(C) any communication from a tracking device (as defined in section 3117 of this title); ...\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(12)(C) (emphasis supplied). By virtue of this tracking device exclusion,[15] no communication from a tracking device can be an electronic communication. Real-time location monitoring effectively converts a cell phone into a tracking device, and therefore cell site data communicated from a cell phone is not an electronic communication under the ECPA.\n\nThe definition of \"wire communication\" does not contain a similarly explicit tracking device exclusion, but the answer is the same nevertheless. \"Wire communication\" is defined to mean a communication containing the human voice. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510(1), (18) (defining \"wire communication\" to be \"any aural transfer\" made in part through aid of wire, and defining \"aural transfer\" as \"a transfer containing the human voice at any point between and including the point of origin and point of reception\"). Cell site data is not a wire communication under this definition because it does not involve the transfer of the human voice at any point along the path between the cell phone and the cell tower. United States v. Forest, 355 F.3d 942, 949 (6th Cir.2004) (\"cell site data clearly does not fall within the definitions of wire or oral communication\"). Although voice communications obviously do take place over a cell phone, this is accomplished on a channel or frequency entirely separate from the control channel that transmits the cell site data necessary to set up the call. U.S. Dep't of Justice, Electronic Surveillance Manual, at 178-79 n. 41 (rev. June 2005). In fact, while the phone is on, cell site data is constantly transmitted over the control channel, even when the phone is not in use. Id. at 40.\n\nTo summarize, a communication from a tracking device, such as cell site data, is neither an electronic nor a wire communication under the ECPA, and so it does not fall within the range of covered services provided by an \"electronic service provider.\" And since a subscriber does not use the phone to track his own movements in real time, prospective cell site data appears to be unrelated to any customer (as opposed to law enforcement) use of the provider's services. Thus, painstaking and methodical analysis of the SCA's technical terms offers no support for treating prospective cell site data as a transactional record under \u00a7 2703(c)(1).[16]\n\n*760 Even more compelling is the structural argument against allowing access to prospective cell site data under the SCA. Unlike other titles of the ECPA, which regulate methods of real-time surveillance, the SCA regulates access to records and communications in storage. As implied by its full title (\"Stored Wire and Electronic Communications and Transactional Records Access\"), the entire focus of the SCA is to describe the circumstances under which the government can compel disclosure of existing communications and transaction records in the hands of third party service providers. Nothing in the SCA contemplates a new form of ongoing surveillance in which law enforcement uses co-opted service provider facilities.\n\nUnlike wiretap and pen/trap orders, which are inherently prospective in nature, \u00a7 2703(d) orders are inherently retrospective. This distinction is most clearly seen in the duration periods which Congress mandated for wiretap and pen/trap orders. Wiretap orders authorize a maximum surveillance period of 30 days, which begins to run no later than 10 days after the order is entered. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(5). Pen/trap orders authorize the installation and use of a pen register for a period \"not to exceed sixty days.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3123(c)(1). By contrast, Congress imposed no duration period whatsoever for \u00a7 2703(d) orders. Likewise, Congress expressly provided that both wiretap orders and pen/trap orders may be extended by the court for limited periods of time. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2518(5), 3123(c)(2). There is no similar provision for extending \u00a7 2703(d) orders. Pen/trap results are ordinarily required to be furnished to law enforcement \"at reasonable intervals during regular business hours for the duration of the order.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3124(b). The wiretap statute authorizes periodic reports to the court concerning the progress of the surveillance. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(6). Again, nothing resembling such ongoing reporting requirements exists in the SCA.\n\nAnother notable omission from \u00a7 2703(d) is sealing of court records. Wiretap orders and pen/trap orders are automatically sealed, reflecting the need to keep the ongoing surveillance under wraps. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2518(8)(b), 3123(d)(1). The SCA does not mention sealing. Pen/trap orders must also direct that the service providers not disclose the existence of the order to third parties until otherwise ordered by the court. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3123(d)(2). Section 2705(b) of the SCA authorizes the court to enter a similar non-disclosure order, but only upon a showing of possible adverse consequences, such as \"seriously jeopardizing an investigation or unduly delaying a trial.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2705(b)(1)-(5).\n\nTaken together, the presence of these provisions in other titles of the ECPA and their corresponding absence from the SCA cannot simply be dismissed as a coincidence or congressional absent-mindedness. Pen registers and wiretaps are surveillance techniques for monitoring communications yet to occur, requiring prior judicial approval and continuing oversight during coming weeks and months; \u00a7 2703(d) permits access to customer transaction records currently in the hands of the service provider, relating to the customer's past and present use of the service. Like a request for production of documents under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 34, \u00a7 2703(d) contemplates the production of existing records, not documents that may be created at some future date related to some future communication. That is the most obvious explanation why the SCA makes no mention of surveillance periods, extensions, periodic reporting, or sealing. If Congress had not intended the SCA to be retrospective in nature, it would have included the same *761 prospective features it built into the wiretap and pen/trap statutes.\n\n5. The Government's Hybrid Theory\n\nThe Sealed Application does not cite the Pen/Trap Statute as authority for obtaining cell site data, for good reason. As noted previously, CALEA explicitly prohibits service providers from disclosing cell phone location information in response to a pen/trap order. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a)(2). The only other reported decision on cell site data has held that this portion of CALEA forbids law enforcement from obtaining cell site location under a pen/trap order. In the Matter of Application of the United States for an Order Authorizing the Use of a Pen Register and Trap and Trace Device and Authorizing Release of Subscriber Information, 384 F. Supp. 2d 562 (E.D.N.Y.2005).\n\nThe government nevertheless contends that a pen/trap order, when combined with a \u00a7 2703(d) order, is sufficient authority to collect prospective cell site data. This dual or \"hybrid\" authority argument is based on a subtle concatenation of three different statutes. The argument proceeds as follows: (1) prospective cell site data falls within the PATRIOT Act's expanded definitions of \"pen register\" and \"trap and trace device\"[17] because carriers use cell site data for \"routing\" calls to and from their proper destination; (2) CALEA amended the law to prevent disclosure of a caller's physical location \"solely\" pursuant to a pen/trap order, so the government need only have some additional authority besides the Pen/Trap Statute to gather prospective cell site information; (3) the SCA provides that additional authority, because cell site data is non-content subscriber information obtainable upon a \"specific and articulable facts\" showing under \u00a7 2703(d); and (4) completing the circle, cell site data authorized by a \u00a7 2703(d) order may be collected prospectively by virtue of the forward-looking procedural features of the Pen/Trap Statute. By mixing and matching statutory provisions in this manner, the government concludes that cell site data enjoys a unique status under electronic surveillance law \u0097 a new form of electronic surveillance combining the advantages of the pen/trap law and the SCA (real-time location tracking based on less than probable cause) without their respective limitations.\n\nInitially, it must be observed that the text of neither the Pen/Trap Statute nor the SCA mentions such hybrid treatment for cell site data. The government's construction of congressional silence might nevertheless be reasonable, assuming its premises were valid. However, those premises do not withstand careful scrutiny.\n\nFirst, the PATRIOT Act's expansion of pen/trap definitions was intended only to reach electronic communications such as e-mail. The added term \"dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information,\" while not defined in the statute, was touted by the bill's proponents as a way to update the pen/trap statute to cover Internet traffic. See 147 Cong. Rec. S11006-07 (Oct. 25, 2001) (statement of Sen. Leahy); 147 Cong. Rec. H7197 (Oct. 23, 2001) (statement of Rep. Conyers). Nothing in the admittedly abbreviated legislative history of the PATRIOT Act suggests that this new definition would extend the reach of the Pen/Trap Statute to cell phone tracking. Contemporary summaries of the PATRIOT Act prepared by knowledgeable commentators, including the DOJ itself, make no mention of expanding pen/traps *762 to capture cell site data.[18] Surely, even amidst the other important features of that broad-ranging statute, such an important change in electronic surveillance law would have been noticed by someone.\n\nNor is it certain that the new definition actually encompasses the cell site data now sought by the government. The traditional pen register was triggered only when the user dialed a telephone number; no information was recorded by the device unless the user attempted to make a call. The PATRIOT Act clarified that a pen register could also record \"routing, addressing, and signaling information,\" as well as numbers dialed. But the expanded definition also indicates that this \"routing, addressing, and signaling\" information is generated by, and incidental to, the transmission of \"a wire or electronic communication.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3127(3). In other words, today's pen register must still be tied to an actual or attempted phone call.[19] As we have already seen, much cell site data is transmitted even when the user is not making or receiving a call, i.e., when no wire or electronic communication is transmitted. In short, neither the text nor the legislative history of the PATRIOT Act offer much support for the government's contention that the cell site data it seeks is covered by the new pen/trap definitions.\n\nThe government's second premise, that the CALEA proviso was intended to amend existing law, is refuted by its legislative history. One of CALEA's main objectives was to allow law enforcement to retain existing surveillance capabilities in the face of technological change in the telecommunications field. See generally Susan Freiwald, Uncertain Privacy: Communication Attributes After the Digital Telephony Act, 69 S. CAL. L.REV. 949 (1996). This goal was to be accomplished by, among other things, requiring telecommunications companies to ensure that its equipment would be capable of \"enabling the government, pursuant to a court order or other lawful authorization, to access call-identifying information that is reasonably available to the carrier.\" Pub.L. No. 103-414, Title I, \u00a7 103, 108 Stat. 4280 (Oct. 25, 1994) (codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a)(2)) (emphasis supplied).\n\nThis assistance proposal was challenged before passage by some privacy advocates, who worried that the broad definition of call-identifying information would be construed as amending the pen register statute to authorize tracking of cell phone users under that statute's minimal requirements. *763 To allay such concerns, FBI Director Louis Freeh, the most vigorous proponent of the legislation, forcefully testified that the proposed legislation \"ensures the maintenance of the status quo\" as to the legal authority for wiretaps and pen/traps, that the bill \"does not enlarge or reduce the government's authority\" for such electronic surveillance, and that the proposed legislation \"relates solely to advanced technology, not legal authority or privacy.\" See Joint Hearing on Digital Telephony and Law Enforcement Access to Advanced Telecommunications Technologies and Services: Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Technology and Law of the Senate Judiciary Comm. and the Subcomm. on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Judiciary Comm., 103rd Cong., 2d Sess., at 2, 28 (statement of Director Freeh).\n\nDirector Freeh was particularly keen to defuse what he described as a false \"transactional data scare\" that the government was \"seeking to `dictate to industry' a new capability to acquire `minute by minute surveillance of individuals' through transactional data.\" Id. at 27. He testified:\n\nThis is a false issue for a number of reasons. First, ... the intent of the legislation is to maintain existing technical capabilities and to \"clarify and define the responsibilities of common carriers ... to provide the assistance required to ensure that government agencies can implement court orders and lawful authorizations to intercept the content of wire and electronic communications and acquire call setup information under chapters 119 and 206 of Title 18 and chapter 36 of Title 50.\" (emphasis added). These chapters have nothing to do with \"transactional information\" under our federal electronic surveillance and privacy laws. All telecommunications \"transactional\" information is already protected by federal law and is exclusively dealt with in chapter 121 of Title 18 of the United States Code (\"Stored Wire and Electronic Communications and Transactional Records Access\"). The proposed legislation does not relate to chapter 121 of Title 18. Second, under federal law, Congress treats law enforcement's use of pen registers and dialing information differently than \"transactional information\" \u0097 such as detailed telephone billing information....\n\nId. at 27-28 (emphasis supplied).\n\nIn order to dispel all doubt about law enforcement intentions, the FBI director proposed inserting the clarifying disclaimer, which eventually was incorporated into the statute at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(a)(2) (\"information acquired solely pursuant to the authority for pen registers and trap and trace devices... shall not include any information that may disclose the physical location of the subscriber\"). Id. at 29. Significantly, the effective date of this proviso was to be four years after enactment, the same time the assistance capability provisions became effective. See Pub.L. 103-414, \u00a7 111(b). By contrast, other portions of CALEA, including the \"specific and articulable facts\" standard for \u00a7 2703(d), were effective on the date of enactment, October 25, 1994. Id. at \u00a7 111(a).\n\nThis legislative history undermines the CALEA step in the government's hybrid authority argument. Rather than altering federal surveillance law, the disclaimer of pen/trap authority was intended to assure that the existing legal framework would continue to apply in spite of anticipated technological advances, at least with respect to physical location information. While the disclaimer did not affirmatively specify what legal authority would govern access to prospective cell *764 site data, Director Freeh's testimony makes clear that an order under SCA \u00a7 2703(d) was not a likely suspect. Id. at 28 (\"The proposed legislation does not relate to chapter 121 of Title 18\"). Far from the silent synergy of disparate statutes now posited by the government, the FBI director in 1994 was insisting that the Pen/Trap Statute has \"nothing to do with\" the SCA, and that transactional information \"is exclusively dealt with in chapter 121 of Title 18,\" i.e., the SCA. Id. at 27-28. Congress unquestionably placed great weight upon the testimony of the FBI Director, law enforcement's chief spokesman and leading advocate for the bill. See, e.g., H.R.Rep. No. 103-827(I), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3489, at 24 (\"The FBI Director testified that the legislation was intended to preserve the status quo, that it was intended to provide law enforcement no more and no less access to information than it had in the past\"). Given Director Freeh's disclaimer, it is highly unlikely that Congress intended CALEA to expand law enforcement surveillance powers in the manner now suggested by the government.\n\nThe government's third premise, that \u00a7 2703(d) authorizes collection of prospective cell site data has already been considered and rejected above in part 4.\n\nThe sum of these questionable premises is no greater than its defective parts. The most glaring difficulty in meshing these disparate statutory provisions is that with a single exception they do not cross-reference one another. The Pen/Trap Statute does not mention the SCA or CALEA; SCA \u00a7 2703 does not mention CALEA or the Pen/Trap Statute; and the CALEA proviso does not mention the SCA. CALEA does refer to the Pen/Trap Statute, but only in the negative sense of disclaiming its applicability. Surely if these various statutory provisions were intended to give birth to a new breed of electronic surveillance, one would expect Congress to have openly acknowledged paternity somewhere along the way.[20] This is especially so given that no other form of *765 electronic surveillance has the mixed statutory parentage that prospective cell site data is claimed to have.\n\nBesides a doubtful pedigree, there is also uncertainty about the hybrid's birthday. These statutes were passed at various times over a 15-year period (1986 to 2001). If as the government contends all three statutes were necessary for conception, then the statutory authority for this surveillance technique was obviously born after the PATRIOT Act amendments of 2001. But this timing undercuts any inference that the CALEA proviso (passed 1994, effective 1998) authorized disclosure of location information under the SCA \"specific and articulable facts\" standard. What need of subsequent legislation if CALEA already did the trick? On the other hand, if CALEA itself marked the true birth date, then the expanded pen/trap definitions in the subsequent PATRIOT Act are rendered immaterial to the analysis. But without the expanded pen/trap definitions, there is no basis to argue that the Pen/Trap Statute covered cell site data; the old definitions only covered numbers dialed.[21] And without the Pen/Trap Statute's prospective features, so clearly lacking in the SCA scheme, the statutory underpinnings for monitoring of cell phone location simply collapse.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe government's hybrid theory, while undeniably creative, amounts to little more than a retrospective assemblage of disparate statutory parts to achieve a desired result. Viewing each statute in proper temporal perspective, there is simply no reason to believe that Congress intended to treat location monitoring of cell phones as an exceptional type of electronic surveillance. While Congressional enactments are sometimes difficult to decipher, employing such a three-rail bank shot to create a new category of electronic surveillance seems almost perverse. Had Congress truly intended such an outcome, there were surely more direct avenues far less likely to confound and mislead judicial inquiry.\n\nDenial of the government's request for prospective cell site data in this instance should have no dire consequences for law enforcement. This type of surveillance is unquestionably available upon a traditional probable cause showing under Rule 41. On the other hand, permitting surreptitious conversion of a cell phone into a tracking device without probable cause raises serious Fourth Amendment concerns, especially when the phone is monitored in the home or other places where privacy is reasonably expected. Cf. United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC, 227 F.3d 450, 464 (D.C.Cir.2000) (citing with approval an FCC finding that providing law enforcement with triangulation capability from cell site towers \"poses difficulties that could undermine individual privacy\"). Absent any sign that Congress has squarely addressed and resolved those concerns in favor of law enforcement, the far more prudent course is to avoid an interpretation which risks a constitutional collision.\n\nJudge Orenstein's opinion was the first word on this topic; this opinion will undoubtedly not be the last. It is written in the full expectation and hope that the government will seek appropriate review by higher courts so that authoritative guidance will be given the magistrate judges who are called upon to rule on these applications on a daily basis.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] The only other reported decision on cell site data in this context is by Magistrate Judge James Orenstein, In Matter of Application of the United States for an Order Authorizing Pen Register and Trap and Trace Device and Release of Subscriber Information, 384 F. Supp. 2d 562 (E.D.N.Y.2005). In United States v. Forest, 355 F.3d 942 (6th Cir.2004), the Sixth Circuit discussed the law enforcement technique of using cell phones as tracking devices in the context of a suppression motion.\n\n[2] In this division alone, 313 pen register applications were processed in 2004.

The court found it unnecessary to reach the issue because, whether or not this use of the cell phone met the definition of a tracking device, suppression was not an available remedy under that statute. Id. at 949-50.\n\n[11] See www.ulocate.com.\n\n[12] In order to use such a device the investigator generally must know the target phone's telephone number (also known as a Mobile Identification Number or MIN). After the operator enters this information into the tracking device, it scans the surrounding airwaves. When the user of that phone places or receives a call, the phone transmits its unique identifying information to the provider's local cell tower. The provider's system then automatically assigns the phone a particular frequency and transmits other information that will allow the phone properly to transmit the user's voice to the cell tower. By gathering this information, the tracking device determines which call (out of the potentially thousands of nearby users) on which to home in. While the user remains on the phone, the tracking device can then register the direction and signal strength (and therefore the approximate distance) of the target phone.\n\nU.S. Dep't of Justice, Electronic Surveillance Manual, at 44-45 (rev. June 2005) (emphasis supplied).\n\n[13] The government argues that recent amendments to the Pen/Trap Statute, when combined with section 2703(d) of the SCA, provide the necessary authority to compel disclosure of prospective cell site data. This \"hybrid authority\" argument is considered (and rejected) later in this opinion.\n\n[14] For present purposes we may disregard \"remote computing service,\" which refers to on-line activity such as e-mail.\n\n[15] This tracking device exclusion is applicable to all three titles of the ECPA: wiretaps, stored communications and transactional records, and pen/traps. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510(12), 2711(1), and 3127(1).\n\n[16] By contrast, historical cell site data more comfortably fits the category of transactional records covered by the SCA. Cell phone companies might legitimately compile such data for customized marketing and billing purposes.\n\n[17] See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3127(3), (4), defining these terms as devices or processes which record or capture \"dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information.\"\n\n[18] See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section: Field Guidance on New Authorities That Relate to Computer Crime and Electronic Evidence Enacted in the USA Patriot Act of 2001, available at http://www.usdoj. gov/criminal/cyber crime/PatriotAct.htm noting that \"Section 216 [of the Patriot Act] updates the pen/trap statute in three important ways: (1) the amendments clarify that law enforcement may use pen/trap orders to trace communications on the Internet and other computer networks; (2) pen/trap orders issued by federal courts now have nationwide effect; and (3) law enforcement authorities must file a special report with the court whenever they use a pen/trap order to install their own monitoring device (such as the FBI's DCS1000) on computers belonging to a public provider.\" See also Robert Stabe, Electronic Surveillance \u0097 Non-Wiretap, \u00a7 3.4, in U.S. Dep't of Justice, Federal Narcotics Prosecutions; American Civil Liberties Union: Surveillance Under the USA Patriot Act, available at http://www.aclu.org/ news/NewsPrint.cfm?

No. 236(I), 107th Cong. 1st Sess., at 53 (2001) (emphasis supplied).\n\n[20] In July 2000, six Republican congressmen introduced a bill (H.B.5018) which would have amended the SCA to require a probable cause showing by the government to gain access to cell phone location information. The bill, entitled the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 2000, was intended to remedy the perceived lack of \"clear legal standards governing when the government can collect location information from cell phone companies.\" H. Rep. 106-932, 106th Cong., 2d Sess. Oct. 4, 2000, reprinted at LEXSEE 106 H. Rep. 932, at 15. Although favorably reported out of committee, the bill was never brought to a vote on either the House or Senate floor, and died a natural death at the close of the Clinton administration. Inchoate legislation (such as H.B. 5018) never presented to either house of Congress is practically meaningless as legislative history for statutes actually enacted by another Congress. See NLRB v. Health Care & Retirement Corp. of America, 511 U.S. 571, 582, 114 S. Ct. 1778, 128 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1994); Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 649-50, 110 S. Ct. 2668, 110 L.

Glenberg, American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia Foundation, Inc., Richmond, Virginia; Michael Adams, American Civil Liberties Union, New York, New York, for Amici Curiae, American Civil Liberties Union and American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia Foundation, Inc., Supporting Christopher Lamparello.\n\nBefore MICHAEL, MOTZ, and KING, Circuit Judges.\n\nReversed and remanded by published opinion. Judge MOTZ wrote the opinion, in which Judge MICHAEL and Judge KING joined.\n\nOPINION\n\nDIANA GRIBBON MOTZ, Circuit Judge.\n\n1\nChristopher Lamparello appeals the district court's order enjoining him from maintaining a gripe website critical of Reverend Jerry Falwell. For the reasons stated below, we reverse.\n\nI.\n\n2\nReverend Falwell is \"a nationally known minister who has been active as a commentator on politics and public affairs.\" Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 47, 108 S. Ct. 876, 99 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1988). He holds the common law trademarks \"Jerry Falwell\" and \"Falwell,\" and the registered trademark \"Listen America with Jerry Falwell.\" Jerry Falwell Ministries can be found online at \"www.falwell.com,\" a website which receives 9,000 hits (or visits) per day.\n\n3\nLamparello registered the domain name \"www.fallwell.com\" on February 11, 1999, after hearing Reverend Falwell give an interview \"in which he expressed opinions about gay people and homosexuality that [Lamparello] considered . . . offensive.\" Lamparello created a website at that domain name to respond to what he believed were \"untruths about gay people.\" Lamparello's website included headlines such as \"Bible verses that Dr. Falwell chooses to ignore\" and \"Jerry Falwell has been bearing false witness (Exodus 20:16) against his gay and lesbian neighbors for a long time.\" The site also contained indepth criticism of Reverend Falwell's views. For example, the website stated:\n\n4\nDr. Falwell says that he is on the side of truth. He says that he will preach that homosexuality is a sin until the day he dies. But we believe that if the reverend were to take another thoughtful look at the scriptures, he would discover that they have been twisted around to support an anti-gay political agenda . . . at the expense of the gospel.\n\n5\nAlthough the interior pages of Lamparello's website did not contain a disclaimer, the homepage prominently stated, \"This website is NOT affiliated with Jerry Falwell or his ministry\"; advised, \"If you would like to visit Rev. Falwell's website, you may click here\"; and provided a hyperlink to Reverend Falwell's website.\n\n6\nAt one point, Lamparello's website included a link to the Amazon.com webpage for a book that offered interpretations of the Bible that Lamparello favored, but the parties agree that Lamparello has never sold goods or services on his website. The parties also agree that \"Lamparello's domain name and web site at www.fallwell.com,\" which received only 200 hits per day, \"had no measurable impact on the quantity of visits to [Reverend Falwell's] web site at www.falwell.com.\" Nonetheless, Reverend Falwell sent Lamparello letters in October 2001 and June 2003 demanding that he cease and desist from using www.fallwell.com or any variation of Reverend Falwell's name as a domain name. Ultimately, Lamparello filed this action against Reverend Falwell and his ministries (collectively referred to hereinafter as \"Reverend Falwell\"), seeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement. Reverend Falwell counter-claimed, alleging trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 (2000), false designation of origin under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), unfair competition under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1126 and the common law of Virginia,1 and cybersquatting under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d).\n\n7\nThe parties stipulated to all relevant facts and filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment to Reverend Falwell, enjoined Lamparello from using Reverend Falwell's mark at www.fallwell.com, and required Lamparello to transfer the domain name to Reverend Falwell. Lamparello, 360 F.Supp.2d at 773, 775. However, the court denied Reverend Falwell's request for statutory damages or attorney fees, reasoning that the \"primary motive\" of Lamparello's website was \"to put forth opinions on issues that were contrary to those of [Reverend Falwell]\" and \"not to take away monies or to profit.\" Id. at 775.\n\n8\nLamparello appeals the district court's order; Reverend Falwell cross-appeals the denial of statutory damages and attorney fees. We review de novo a district court's ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment. See People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney, 263 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.2001) [hereinafter \"PETA\"].\n\nII.\n\n9\nWe first consider Reverend Falwell's claims of trademark infringement and false designation of origin.\n\nA.\n\n10\nSection 32 of the Lanham Act creates a cause of action against:\n\n11\n[a]ny person who shall, without the consent of the registrant \u2014 (a) use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\n\n12\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1). Similarly, Section 43(a) creates a cause of action against:\n\n13\n[a]ny person who, on or in connection with any goods or services,. . . uses in commerce any word . . . [or] name . . ., or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which \u2014 (A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person.\n\n14\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1)(A).\n\n15\nBoth infringement and false designation of origin have five elements. To prevail under either cause of action, the trademark holder must prove:\n\n16\n(1) that it possesses a mark; (2) that the [opposing party] used the mark; (3) that the [opposing party's] use of the mark occurred \"in commerce\"; (4) that the [opposing party] used the mark \"in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising\" of goods or services; and (5) that the [opposing party] used the mark in a manner likely to confuse consumers.\n\n17\nPETA, 263 F.3d at 364 (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114, 1125, and Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon, 43 F.3d at 930).\n\n18\nTrademark law serves the important functions of protecting product identification, providing consumer information, and encouraging the production of quality goods and services. See Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prods. Co., 514 U.S. 159, 164, 115 S. Ct. 1300, 131 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1995). But protections \"`against unfair competition'\" cannot be transformed into \"`rights to control language.'\" CPC Int'l, Inc. v. Skippy Inc., 214 F.3d 456, 462 (4th Cir.2000) (quoting Mark A. Lemley, The Modern Lanham Act and the Death of Common Sense, 108 Yale L.J. 1687, 1710-11 (1999)). \"Such a transformation\" would raise serious First Amendment concerns because it would limit the\n\n19\nability to discuss the products or criticize the conduct of companies that may be of widespread public concern and importance. Much useful social and commercial discourse would be all but impossible if speakers were under threat of an infringement lawsuit every time they made reference to a person, company or product by using its trademark.\n\n20\nId. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n21\nLamparello and his amici argue at length that application of the Lanham Act must be restricted to \"commercial speech\" to assure that trademark law does not become a tool for unconstitutional censorship. The Sixth Circuit has endorsed this view, see Taubman Co. v. Webfeats, 319 F.3d 770, 774 (6th Cir.2003), and the Ninth Circuit recently has done so as well, see Bosley Med. Inst., Inc. v. Kremer, 403 F.3d 672, 674 (9th Cir.2005).\n\n22\nIn its two most significant recent amendments to the Lanham Act, the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 (\"FTDA\") and the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of 1999 (\"ACPA\"), Congress left little doubt that it did not intend for trademark laws to impinge the First Amendment rights of critics and commentators. The dilution statute applies to only a \"commercial use in commerce of a mark,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(c)(1), and explicitly states that the \"[n]oncommercial use of a mark\" is not actionable. Id. \u00a7 1125(c)(4). Congress explained that this language was added to \"adequately address[] legitimate First Amendment concerns,\" H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 4 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1029, 1031, and \"incorporate[d] the concept of `commercial' speech from the `commercial speech' doctrine.\" Id. at 8, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1035; cf. Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 554, 121 S. Ct. 2404, 150 L. Ed. 2d 532 (2001) (defining commercial speech as \"speech proposing a commercial transaction\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Similarly, Congress directed that in determining whether an individual has engaged in cybersquatting, the courts may consider whether the person's use of the mark is a \"bona fide noncommercial or fair use.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IV). The legislature believed this provision necessary to \"protect[ ] the rights of Internet users and the interests of all Americans in free speech and protected uses of trademarked names for such things as parody, comment, criticism, comparative advertising, news reporting, etc.\" S.Rep. No. 106-140 (1999),  1999 WL 594571, at *8.\n\n23\nIn contrast, the trademark infringement and false designation of origin provisions of the Lanham Act (Sections 32 and 43(a), respectively) do not employ the term \"noncommercial.\" They do state, however, that they pertain only to the use of a mark \"in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1)(a), or \"in connection with any goods or services,\" id. \u00a7 1125(a)(1). But courts have been reluctant to define those terms narrowly.2 Rather, as the Second Circuit has explained, \"[t]he term `services' has been interpreted broadly\" and so \"[t]he Lanham Act has . . . been applied to defendants furnishing a wide variety of non-commercial public and civic benefits.\" United We Stand Am., Inc. v. United We Stand, Am. N.Y., Inc., 128 F.3d 86, 89-90 (2d Cir.1997). Similarly, in PETA we noted that a website need not actually sell goods or services for the use of a mark in that site's domain name to constitute a use \"`in connection with' goods or services.\" PETA, 263 F.3d at 365; see also Taubman Co., 319 F.3d at 775 (concluding that website with two links to websites of for-profit entities violated the Lanham Act).\n\n24\nThus, even if we accepted Lamparello's contention that Sections 32 and 43(a) of the Lanham Act apply only to commercial speech, we would still face the difficult question of what constitutes such speech under those provisions. In the case at hand, we need not resolve that question or determine whether Sections 32 and 43(a) apply exclusively to commercial speech because Reverend Falwell's claims of trademark infringement and false designation fail for a more obvious reason. The hallmark of such claims is a likelihood of confusion \u2014 and there is no likelihood of confusion here.\n\nB.\n\n1.\n\n25\n\"[T]he use of a competitor's mark that does not cause confusion as to source is permissible.\" Dorr-Oliver, Inc. v. Fluid-Quip, Inc., 94 F.3d 376, 380 (7th Cir.1996). Accordingly, Lamparello can only be liable for infringement and false designation if his use of Reverend Falwell's mark would be likely to cause confusion as to the source of the website found at www.fallwell.com. This likelihood-of-confusion test \"generally strikes a comfortable balance\" between the First Amendment and the rights of markholders. Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc., 296 F.3d 894, 900 (9th Cir.2002).\n\n26\nWe have identified seven factors helpful in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists as to the source of a work, but \"not all these factors are always relevant or equally emphasized in each case.\" Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple, 747 F.2d 1522, 1527 (4th Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). The factors are: \"(a) the strength or distinctiveness of the mark; (b) the similarity of the two marks; (c) the similarity of the goods/services the marks identify; (d) the similarity of the facilities the two parties use in their businesses; (e) the similarity of the advertising used by the two parties; (f) the defendant's intent; (g) actual confusion.\" Id. (citation omitted).\n\n27\nReverend Falwell's mark is distinctive, and the domain name of Lamparello's website, www.fallwell.com, closely resembles it. But, although Lamparello and Reverend Falwell employ similar marks online, Lamparello's website looks nothing like Reverend Falwell's; indeed, Lamparello has made no attempt to imitate Reverend Falwell's website. Moreover, Reverend Falwell does not even argue that Lamparello's website constitutes advertising or a facility for business, let alone a facility or advertising similar to that of Reverend Falwell. Furthermore, Lamparello clearly created his website intending only to provide a forum to criticize ideas, not to steal customers.\n\n28\nMost importantly, Reverend Falwell and Lamparello do not offer similar goods or services. Rather they offer opposing ideas and commentary. Reverend Falwell's mark identifies his spiritual and political views; the website at www.fallwell.com criticizes those very views. After even a quick glance at the content of the website at www.fallwell.com, no one seeking Reverend Falwell's guidance would be misled by the domain name \u2014 www.fallwell.com \u2014 into believing Reverend Falwell authorized the content of that website. No one would believe that Reverend Falwell sponsored a site criticizing himself, his positions, and his interpretations of the Bible. See New Kids on the Block v. News Am. Publ'g, Inc., 971 F.2d 302, 308-09 (9th Cir.1992) (stating that use of a mark to solicit criticism of the markholder implies the markholder is not the sponsor of the use).3\n\n29\nFinally, the fact that people contacted Reverend Falwell's ministry to report that they found the content at www.fallwell.com antithetical to Reverend Falwell's views does not illustrate, as Reverend Falwell claims, that the website engendered actual confusion. To the contrary, the anecdotal evidence Reverend Falwell submitted shows that those searching for Reverend Falwell's site and arriving instead at Lamparello's site quickly realized that Reverend Falwell was not the source of the content therein.\n\n30\nFor all of these reasons, it is clear that the undisputed record evidences no likelihood of confusion. In fact, Reverend Falwell even conceded at oral argument that those viewing the content of Lamparello's website probably were unlikely to confuse Reverend Falwell with the source of that material.\n\n2.\n\n31\nNevertheless, Reverend Falwell argues that he is entitled to prevail under the \"initial interest confusion\" doctrine. This relatively new and sporadically applied doctrine holds that \"the Lanham Act forbids a competitor from luring potential customers away from a producer by initially passing off its goods as those of the producer's, even if confusion as to the source of the goods is dispelled by the time any sales are consummated.\" Dorr-Oliver, 94 F.3d at 382. According to Reverend Falwell, this doctrine requires us to compare his mark with Lamparello's website domain name, www.fallwell.com, without considering the content of Lamparello's website. Reverend Falwell argues that some people who misspell his name may go to www.fallwell.com assuming it is his site, thus giving Lamparello an unearned audience \u2014 albeit one that quickly disappears when it realizes it has not reached Reverend Falwell's site. This argument fails for two reasons.\n\n32\nFirst, we have never adopted the initial interest confusion theory; rather, we have followed a very different mode of analysis, requiring courts to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists by \"examin[ing] the allegedly infringing use in the context in which it is seen by the ordinary consumer.\" Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. L & L Wings, Inc., 962 F.2d 316, 319 (4th Cir.1992) (emphasis added) (citing cases); see also What-A-Burger of Va., Inc. v. Whataburger, Inc., 357 F.3d 441, 450 (4th Cir.2004).\n\n33\nContrary to Reverend Falwell's arguments, we did not abandon this approach in PETA. Our inquiry in PETA was limited to whether Doughney's use of the domain name \"www.peta.org\" constituted a successful enough parody of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals that no one was likely to believe www.peta.org was sponsored or endorsed by that organization. For a parody to be successful, it \"must convey two simultaneous \u2014 and contradictory \u2014 messages: that it is the original, but also that it is not the original and is instead a parody.\" PETA, 263 F.3d at 366 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Doughney argued that his domain name conveyed the first message (that it was PETA's website) and that the content of his website conveyed the requisite second message (that it was not PETA's site). Id. Although \"[t]he website's content ma[de] it clear that it [wa]s not related to PETA,\" id., we concluded that the website's content could not convey the requisite second message because the site's content \"[wa]s not conveyed simultaneously with the first message, [i.e., the domain name itself,] as required to be considered a parody.\" Id. at 366. Accordingly, we found the \"district court properly rejected Doughney's parody defense.\" Id. at 367.\n\n34\nPETA simply outlines the parameters of the parody defense; it does not adopt the initial interest confusion theory or otherwise diminish the necessity of examining context when determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists. Indeed, in PETA itself, rather than embracing a new approach, we reiterated that \"[t]o determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists, a court should not consider how closely a fragment of a given use duplicates the trademark, but must instead consider whether the use in its entirety creates a likelihood of confusion.\" Id. at 366 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added). When dealing with domain names, this means a court must evaluate an allegedly infringing domain name in conjunction with the content of the website identified by the domain name.4\n\n35\nMoreover, even if we did endorse the initial interest confusion theory, that theory would not assist Reverend Falwell here because it provides no basis for liability in circumstances such as these. The few appellate courts that have followed the Ninth Circuit and imposed liability under this theory for using marks on the Internet have done so only in cases involving a factor utterly absent here \u2014 one business's use of another's mark for its own financial gain. See, e.g., PACCAR Inc. v. TeleScan Techs., L.L.C., 319 F.3d 243, 253 (6th Cir.2003); Promatek Indus., Ltd. v. Equitrac Corp., 300 F.3d 808, 812 (7th Cir.2002); Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entm't Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1055-56 (9th Cir.1999).\n\n36\nProfiting financially from initial interest confusion is thus a key element for imposition of liability under this theory.5 When an alleged infringer does not compete with the markholder for sales, \"some initial confusion will not likely facilitate free riding on the goodwill of another mark, or otherwise harm the user claiming infringement. Where confusion has little or no meaningful effect in the marketplace, it is of little or no consequence in our analysis.\" Checkpoint Sys., 269 F.3d at 296-97. For this reason, even the Ninth Circuit has stated that a firm is not liable for using another's mark in its domain name if it \"could not financially capitalize on [a] misdirected consumer [looking for the markholder's site] even if it so desired.\" Interstellar Starship Servs., Ltd. v. Epix, Inc., 304 F.3d 936, 946 (9th Cir.2002).\n\n37\nThis critical element \u2014 use of another firm's mark to capture the markholder's customers and profits \u2014 simply does not exist when the alleged infringer establishes a gripe site that criticizes the markholder. See Hannibal Travis, The Battle For Mindshare: The Emerging Consensus that the First Amendment Protects Corporate Criticism and Parody on the Internet, 10 Va. J.L. & Tech. 3, 85 (Winter 2005) (\"The premise of the `initial interest' confusion cases is that by using the plaintiff's trademark to divert its customers, the defendant is engaging in the old `bait and switch.' But because . . . Internet users who find [gripe sites] are not sold anything, the mark may be the `bait,' but there is simply no `switch.'\") (citations omitted).6 Applying the initial interest confusion theory to gripe sites like Lamparello's would enable the markholder to insulate himself from criticism \u2014 or at least to minimize access to it. We have already condemned such uses of the Lanham Act, stating that a markholder cannot \"`shield itself from criticism by forbidding the use of its name in commentaries critical of its conduct.'\" CPC Int'l, 214 F.3d at 462 (quoting L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc., 811 F.2d 26, 33 (1st Cir.1987)). \"[J]ust because speech is critical of a corporation and its business practices is not a sufficient reason to enjoin the speech.\" Id.\n\n38\nIn sum, even if we were to accept the initial interest confusion theory, that theory would not apply in the case at hand. Rather, to determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists as to the source of a gripe site like that at issue in this case, a court must look not only to the allegedly infringing domain name, but also to the underlying content of the website. When we do so here, it is clear, as explained above, that no likelihood of confusion exists. Therefore, the district court erred in granting Reverend Falwell summary judgment on his infringement, false designation, and unfair competition claims.\n\nIII.\n\n39\nWe evaluate Reverend Falwell's cybersquatting claim separately because the elements of a cybersquatting violation differ from those of traditional Lanham Act violations. To prevail on a cybersquatting claim, Reverend Falwell must show that Lamparello: (1) \"had a bad faith intent to profit from using the [www.fallwell.com] domain name,\" and (2) the domain name www.fallwell.com \"is identical or confusingly similar to, or dilutive of, the distinctive and famous [Falwell] mark.\" PETA, 263 F.3d at 367 (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(A)).\n\n40\n\"The paradigmatic harm that the ACPA was enacted to eradicate\" is \"the practice of cybersquatters registering several hundred domain names in an effort to sell them to the legitimate owners of the mark.\" Lucas Nursery & Landscaping, Inc. v. Grosse, 359 F.3d 806, 810 (6th Cir.2004). The Act was also intended to stop the registration of multiple marks with the hope of selling them to the highest bidder, \"distinctive marks to defraud consumers\" or \"to engage in counterfeiting activities,\" and \"well-known marks to prey on consumer confusion by misusing the domain name to divert customers from the mark owner's site to the cybersquatter's own site, many of which are pornography sites that derive advertising revenue based on the number of visits, or `hits,' the site receives.\" S.Rep. No. 106-140, 1999 WL 594571, at *5-6. The Act was not intended to prevent \"noncommercial uses of a mark, such as for comment, criticism, parody, news reporting, etc.,\" and thus they \"are beyond the scope\" of the ACPA. Id. at *9.\n\n41\nTo distinguish abusive domain name registrations from legitimate ones, the ACPA directs courts to consider nine nonexhaustive factors:\n\n42\n(I) the trademark or other intellectual property rights of the person, if any, in the domain name;\n\n43\n(II) the extent to which the domain name consists of the legal name of the person or a name that is otherwise commonly used to identify that person;\n\n44\n(III) the person's prior use, if any, of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of any goods or services;\n\n45\n(IV) the person's bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site accessible under the domain name;\n\n46\n(V) the person's intent to divert consumers from the mark owner's online location to a site accessible under the domain name that could harm the goodwill represented by the mark, either for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark, by creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the site;\n\n47\n(VI) the person's offer to transfer, sell, or otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner or any third party for financial gain without having used, or having an intent to use, the domain name in the bona fide offering of any goods or services, or the person's prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct;\n\n48\n(VII) the person's provision of material and misleading false contact information when applying for the registration of the domain name, the person's intentional failure to maintain accurate contact information, or the person's prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct;\n\n49\n(VIII) the person's registration or acquisition of multiple domain names which the person knows are identical or confusingly similar to marks of others that are distinctive at the time of the registration of such domain names, or dilutive of famous marks of others that are famous at the time of registration of such domain names, without regard to the goods or services of the parties; and\n\n50\n(IX) the extent to which the mark incorporated in the person's domain name registration is or is not distinctive and famous within the meaning of subsection (c)(1) of this section.\n\n51\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(B)(i); see also H.R.Rep. No. 106-412 (1999), 1999 WL 970519, at *10.\n\n52\nThese factors attempt \"to balance the property interests of trademark owners with the legitimate interests of Internet users and others who seek to make lawful uses of others' marks, including for purposes such as comparative advertising, comment, criticism, parody, news reporting, fair use, etc.\" H.R. Rep. No. 106-412, 1999 WL 970519, at *10 (emphasis added). \"The first four [factors] suggest circumstances that may tend to indicate an absence of bad-faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a mark, and the others suggest circumstances that may tend to indicate that such bad-faith intent exists.\" Id. However, \"[t]here is no simple formula for evaluating and weighing these factors. For example, courts do not simply count up which party has more factors in its favor after the evidence is in.\" Harrods Ltd. v. Sixty Internet Domain Names, 302 F.3d 214, 234 (4th Cir.2002). In fact, because use of these listed factors is permissive, \"[w]e need not. . . march through\" them all in every case. Virtual Works, Inc. v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 238 F.3d 264, 269 (4th Cir.2001). \"The factors are given to courts as a guide, not as a substitute for careful thinking about whether the conduct at issue is motivated by a bad faith intent to profit.\" Lucas Nursery & Landscaping, 359 F.3d at 811.\n\n53\nAfter close examination of the undisputed facts involved in this case, we can only conclude that Reverend Falwell cannot demonstrate that Lamparello \"had a bad faith intent to profit from using the [www.fallwell.com] domain name.\" PETA, 263 F.3d at 367. Lamparello clearly employed www.fallwell.com simply to criticize Reverend Falwell's views. Factor IV of the ACPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IV), counsels against finding a bad faith intent to profit in such circumstances because \"use of a domain name for purposes of . . . comment, [and] criticism,\" H.R.Rep. No. 106-412, 1999 WL 970519, at *11, constitutes a \"bona fide noncommercial or fair use\" under the statute, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IV).7 That Lamparello provided a link to an Amazon.com webpage selling a book he favored does not diminish the communicative function of his website. The use of a domain name to engage in criticism or commentary \"even where done for profit\" does not alone evidence a bad faith intent to profit, H.R.Rep. No. 106-412, 1999 WL 970519, at *11, and Lamparello did not even stand to gain financially from sales of the book at Amazon.com. Thus factor IV weighs heavily in favor of finding Lamparello lacked a bad faith intent to profit from the use of the domain name.\n\n54\nEqually important, Lamparello has not engaged in the type of conduct described in the statutory factors as typifying the bad faith intent to profit essential to a successful cybersquatting claim. First, we have already held, supra Part II.B, that Lamparello's domain name does not create a likelihood of confusion as to source or affiliation. Accordingly, Lamparello has not engaged in the type of conduct \u2014 \"creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the site,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(V) \u2014 described as an indicator of a bad faith intent to profit in factor V of the statute.\n\n55\nFactors VI and VIII also counsel against finding a bad faith intent to profit here. Lamparello has made no attempt \u2014 or even indicated a willingness \u2014 \"to transfer, sell, or otherwise assign the domain name to [Reverend Falwell] or any third party for financial gain.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(VI). Similarly, Lamparello has not registered \"multiple domain names,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d)(1)(B)(i)(VIII); rather, the record indicates he has registered only one. Thus, Lamparello's conduct is not of the suspect variety described in factors VI and VIII of the Act.\n\n56\nNotably, the case at hand differs markedly from those in which the courts have found a bad faith intent to profit from domain names used for websites engaged in political commentary or parody. For example, in PETA we found the registrant of www.peta.org engaged in cybersquatting because www.peta.org was one of fifty to sixty domain names Doughney had registered, PETA, 263 F.3d at 362, and because Doughney had evidenced a clear intent to sell www.peta.org to PETA, stating that PETA should try to \"`settle' with him and `make him an offer.'\" Id. at 368. See also Virtual Works, 238 F.3d at 269-70. Similarly, in Coca-Cola Co. v. Purdy, 382 F.3d 774 (8th Cir.2004), the Eighth Circuit found an anti-abortion activist who had registered domain names incorporating famous marks such as \"Washington Post\" liable for cybersquatting because he had registered almost seventy domain names, had offered to stop using the Washington Post mark if the newspaper published an opinion piece by him on its editorial page, and posted content that created a likelihood of confusion as to whether the famous markholders sponsored the anti-abortion sites and \"ha[d] taken positions on hotly contested issues.\" Id. at 786. In contrast, Lamparello did not register multiple domain names, he did not offer to transfer them for valuable consideration, and he did not create a likelihood of confusion.\n\n57\nInstead, Lamparello, like the plaintiffs in two cases recently decided by the Fifth and Sixth Circuits, created a gripe site. Both courts expressly refused to find that gripe sites located at domain names nearly identical to the marks at issue violated the ACPA. In TMI, Inc. v. Maxwell, 368 F.3d 433, 434-35 (5th Cir.2004), Joseph Maxwell, a customer of homebuilder TMI, registered the domain name \"www.trendmakerhome.com,\" which differed by only one letter from TMI's mark, TrendMaker Homes, and its domain name, \"www.trendmakerhomes.com.\" Maxwell used the site to complain about his experience with TMI and to list the name of a contractor whose work pleased him. After his registration expired, Maxwell registered \"www.trendmakerhome.info.\" TMI then sued, alleging cybersquatting. The Fifth Circuit reversed the district court's finding that Maxwell violated the ACPA, reasoning that his site was noncommercial and designed only \"to inform potential customers about a negative experience with the company.\" Id. at 438-39.\n\n58\nSimilarly, in Lucas Nursery & Landscaping, a customer of Lucas Nursery registered the domain name \"www.lucasnursery.com\" and posted her dissatisfaction with the company's landscaping services. Because the registrant, Grosse, like Lamparello, registered a single domain name, the Sixth Circuit concluded that her conduct did not constitute that which Congress intended to proscribe \u2014 i.e., the registration of multiple domain names. Lucas Nursery & Landscaping, 359 F.3d at 810. Noting that Grosse's gripe site did not create any confusion as to sponsorship and that she had never attempted to sell the domain name to the markholder, the court found that Grosse's conduct was not actionable under the ACPA. The court explained: \"One of the ACPA's main objectives is the protection of consumers from slick internet peddlers who trade on the names and reputations of established brands. The practice of informing fellow consumers of one's experience with a particular service provider is surely not inconsistent with this ideal.\" Id. at 811.\n\n59\nLike Maxwell and Grosse before him, Lamparello has not evidenced a bad faith intent to profit under the ACPA. To the contrary, he has used www.fallwell.com to engage in the type of \"comment[] [and] criticism\" that Congress specifically stated militates against a finding of bad faith intent to profit. See S. Rep. No. 106-140, 1999 WL 594571, at *14. And he has neither registered multiple domain names nor attempted to transfer www.fallwell.com for valuable consideration. We agree with the Fifth and Sixth Circuits that, given these circumstances, the use of a mark in a domain name for a gripe site criticizing the markholder does not constitute cybersquatting.\n\nIV.\n\n60\nFor the foregoing reasons, Lamparello, rather than Reverend Falwell, is entitled to summary judgment on all counts.8 Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for entry of judgment for Lamparello.\n\n61\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\nNotes:\n\n1\nAs the district court noted, although Reverend Falwell \"assert[s] a claim under 15 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 1126 for a violation of federal unfair competition law, no such cause of action exists. False Designation of Origin is commonly referred to as unfair competition law. . . .\"Lamparello v. Falwell, 360 F. Supp. 2d 768, 773 n. 2 (E.D.Va.2004). Accordingly, the district court \"construed any claim by [Falwell] for violation of federal unfair competition law as a claim for violation of 15 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 1125.\" Id. We will do the same. Furthermore, because \"[t]he test for trademark infringement and unfair competition under the Lanham Act is essentially the same as that for common law unfair competition under Virginia law because both address the likelihood of confusion as to the source of the goods or services involved,\" Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon, Inc. v. Alpha of Va., Inc., 43 F.3d 922, 930 n. 10 (4th Cir.1995), Reverend Falwell's state-law unfair competition claim rises or falls with his federal claims of infringement and false designation of origin. Therefore, we will not analyze his state-law claim separately.\n\n2\nIndeed, Lamparello agreed at oral argument that the Lanham Act's prohibitions on infringement and false designation apply to more than just commercial speech as defined by the Supreme Court\n\n3\nIf Lamparello had neither criticized Reverend Falwell by name nor expressly rejected Reverend Falwell's teachings, but instead simply had quoted Bible passages and offered interpretations of them subtly different from those of Reverend Falwell, this would be a different case. For, while a gripe site, or a website dedicated to criticism of the markholder, will seldom create a likelihood of confusion, a website purporting to be the official site of the markholder and, for example, articulating positions that could plausibly have come from the markholder may well create a likelihood of confusion\n\n4\nContrary to Reverend Falwell's suggestions, this rule does not change depending on how similar the domain name or title is to the mark. Hence, Reverend Falwell's assertion that he objects only to Lamparello using the domain name www.fallwell.com and has no objection to Lamparello posting his criticisms at \"www.falwelliswrong.com,\" or a similar domain name, does not entitle him to a different evaluation rule. Rather it has long been established that even when alleged infringers use thevery marks at issue in titles, courts look to the underlying content to determine whether the titles create a likelihood of confusion as to source. See, e.g., Parks v. LaFace Records, 329 F.3d 437, 452-54 (6th Cir.2003); Mattel, 296 F.3d at 901-02; Westchester Media v. PRL USA Holdings, Inc., 214 F.3d 658, 667-68 (5th Cir.2000); Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994, 1000-01 (2d Cir.1989).\n\n5\nOffline uses of marks found to cause actionable initial interest confusion also have involved financial gainSee Elvis Presley Enters., Inc. v. Capece, 141 F.3d 188, 204 (5th Cir.1998); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Pegasus Petroleum Corp., 818 F.2d 254, 260 (2d Cir.1987). And even those courts recognizing the initial interest confusion theory of liability but finding no actionable initial confusion involved one business's use of another's mark for profit. See, e.g., Savin Corp. v. The Savin Group, 391 F.3d 439, 462 n. 13 (2d Cir.2004); AM Gen. Corp. v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 311 F.3d 796, 827-28 (7th Cir.2002); Checkpoint Sys., Inc. v. Check Point Software Techs., Inc., 269 F.3d 270, 298 (3d Cir.2001); Hasbro, Inc. v. Clue Computing, Inc., 232 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2000); Syndicate Sales, Inc. v. Hampshire Paper Corp., 192 F.3d 633, 638 (7th Cir.1999); Rust Env't & Infrastructure, Inc. v. Teunissen, 131 F.3d 1210, 1217 (7th Cir.1997); Dorr-Oliver, 94 F.3d at 383.\n\n6\nAlthough the appellate courts that have adopted the initial interest confusion theory have only applied it to profit-seeking uses of another's mark, the district courts have not so limited the application of the theory. Without expressly referring to this theory, two frequently-discussed district court cases have held that using another's domain name to post content antithetical to the markholder constitutes infringementSee Planned Parenthood Fed'n of Am., Inc. v. Bucci, No. 97 Civ. 0629, 1997 WL 133313 (S.D.N.Y. March 24, 1997), aff'd, 152 F.3d 920 (2d Cir.1998) (table) (finding use of domain name \"www.plannedparenthood.com\" to provide links to passages of anti-abortion book constituted infringement); Jews for Jesus v. Brodsky, 993 F. Supp. 282 (D.N.J.1998), aff'd, 159 F.3d 1351 (3d Cir.1998) (table) (finding use of \"www.jewsforjesus.org\" to criticize religious group constituted infringement). We think both cases were wrongly decided to the extent that in determining whether the domain names were confusing, the courts did not consider whether the websites' content would dispel any confusion. In expanding the initial interest confusion theory of liability, these cases cut it off from its moorings to the detriment of the First Amendment.\n\n7\nWe note that factor IV does not protect a faux noncommercial site, that is, a noncommercial site created by the registrant for the sole purpose of avoiding liability under the FTDA, which exempts noncommercial uses of marks,see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(c)(4)(B), or under the ACPA. As explained by the Senate Report discussing the ACPA, an individual cannot avoid liability for registering and attempting to sell a hundred domain names incorporating famous marks by posting noncommercial content at those domain names. See S.Rep. No. 106-140, 1999 WL 594571, at *14 (citing Panavision Int'l v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316 (9th Cir.1998)). But Lamparello's sole purpose for registering www.fallwell.com was to criticize Reverend Falwell, and this noncommercial use was not a ruse to avoid liability. Therefore, factor IV indicates that Lamparello did not have a bad faith intent to profit.\n\n8\nGiven our resolution of Lamparello's appeal, Reverend Falwell's cross-appeal with respect to statutory damages and attorney fees is moot", "annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 51}, {"start": 52, "end": 91}, {"start": 92, "end": 116}, {"start": 117, "end": 150}, {"start": 151, "end": 174}, {"start": 175,

Plaintiffs asserted statutory and common law publicity-right claims and an unfair competition claim under California law.\n\nThe California anti-SLAPP statute, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 425.16, was enacted to allow for early dismissal of meritless first amendment cases aimed at chilling expression though litigation.\n\nSection 301 of the federal Copyright Act adopted a two-part test to determine whether a state law claim was preempted by the Act; first, whether the subject matter of the state claim fell within the subject matter of copyright, as described in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103; and second, if so, whether the rights asserted under state law were equivalent to the rights contained in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106.\n\nAt step one of the Copyright Act test, the panel held that the subject matter of the state law claims fell within the subject matter of copyright. Specifically, the panel held that a publicity-right claim may proceed when a likeness is used non-consensually on merchandise or in advertising; but where a likeness has been captured in a copyrighted artistic visual work and the work itself is being distributed for personal use, a publicity-right claim is little more than a thinly-disguised copyright claim because it seeks to hold a copyright holder liable for exercising his exclusive rights under the Copyright Act. The panel concluded that plaintiffs' publicity-right claims and the derivative Unfair Competition Law claim challenged control of the artistic work itself, and accordingly, the subject matter of the state law claims fell exclusively within the subject matter of copyright.\n\nAt step two, the panel held that the rights plaintiffs asserted were equivalent to rights within the general scope of copyright.\n\nThe panel concluded that plaintiffs' state law claims were preempted by section 301 of the federal Copyright Act because plaintiffs sought to hold T3Media liable for exercising rights governed exclusively by copyright law. The panel further held that plaintiffs could not demonstrate a reasonable probability of prevailing on their challenged claims; and the district court did not err in granting the special motion to strike, and dismissing without leave to amend.\n\nNOT FOR PUBLICATION\n\nOPINION\n\nM. SMITH, Circuit Judge.\n\nFormer student-athletes Patrick Maloney and Tim Judge allege that defendant T3Media, Inc. (T3Media) exploited their likenesses commercially by selling non-exclusive licenses permitting consumers to download photographs from the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Photo Library for non-commercial art use. Maloney and Judge assert statutory and common law publicity-right claims and an unfair competition claim under California law. The district court held that the federal Copyright Act preempts plaintiffs' claims and granted T3Media's special motion to strike pursuant to California's anti-SLAPP statute. We affirm.\n\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nA. The Parties\n\nPlaintiffs Patrick Maloney and Tim Judge are former NCAA student-athletes who played for the Catholic University (CU) men's basketball team between 1997 and 2001. In their final year at CU, they made it all the way to the Division III national championship game, and helped lead the underdog Cardinals to an upset 76-62 victory over the William Paterson University Pioneers. The game's drama was captured in a series of photographs depicting the plaintiffs in play, and later posing as members of the team with CU's first-ever national championship trophy. The NCAA owns or controls the copyright to these photographs. It accordingly placed them into its collection, the NCAA Photo Library.\n\nT3Media provides storage, hosting, and licensing services for a wide variety of digital content. In 2012, it contracted with the NCAA to store, host, and license the images in the NCAA Photo Library. The NCAA Photo Library itself contains thousands of photographs chronicling seventy years of NCAA sports history. Until 2014, T3Media made the photographs available to the public through its website, Paya.com.\n\nConsumers could view digital thumbnails of the images contained in the NCAA Photo Library on Paya.com, and obtain for $20 to $30 a non-exclusive license permitting them to download a copy of a chosen photograph. Brief descriptions of the events depicted in the images accompanied the digital thumbnails.[1] Users were also required to assent to a \"Content License Agreement\" in order to download one of the photographs. Pursuant to that agreement, consumers could \"use a single copy of the image for non-commercial art use.\" Consumers did not obtain \"any right or license to use the name or likeness of any individual (including any athlete, announcer, or coach) appearing in the Content in connection with or as an express or implied endorsement of any product or service.\"\n\nB. Procedural History\n\nPlaintiffs commenced this action in the Central District of California in June 2014. They allege that T3Media exploited their names and likenesses commercially by selling photographs on Paya.com depicting their 2001 triumph. They purport to represent a putative class \"of all current and former NCAA student-athletes whose names, images, and likenesses have been used without their consent by [T3Media] for the purpose of advertising, selling, or soliciting purchases of the photographs themselves.\" The complaint asserts claims for violation of California's statutory right of publicity, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3344, common law right of publicity, and Unfair Competition Law (UCL), Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17200 et seq.[2]\n\nIn October 2014, T3Media moved to strike the complaint pursuant to California's anti-SLAPP statute. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 425.16. T3Media argued that the federal Copyright Act preempts plaintiffs' claims, that they are barred by the First Amendment, and that California's statutory exemption for news, public affairs, or sports broadcasts or accounts precludes liability for any publicity-right violations. The district court granted T3Media's motion to strike on March 6, 2015, holding that the Copyright Act preempts plaintiffs' claims, and declining to reach the other defenses.\n\nAccording to the district court, the plaintiffs asserted rights that fell within the subject matter of copyright because their claims derived from the licensing of copyrighted photographs, which were original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression under the circumstances. The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that a publicity-right claim involving a photograph is not subject to preemption. It distinguished between claims derived from \"selling a copyrighted photograph containing an athlete's likeness,\" which it said require preemption, and claims based on \"using the athlete's likeness contained in the photograph for some other purpose,\" which it said do not. The district court also concluded that plaintiffs were asserting rights equivalent to the exclusive rights contained in the Copyright Act because they did not identify a use of their names or likenesses \"independent of the display, reproduction, and distribution of the copyrighted images in which they are depicted.\" Lastly, the district court found that the plaintiffs' UCL claim was derivative of the publicity-right claims, and thus concluded that it failed because the publicity-right claims were preempted by the Copyright Act. The court denied plaintiffs' request for additional discovery because the identified topics did not bear on the issue of preemption. The court also acknowledged that plaintiffs had been afforded \"an opportunity to amend and to conduct at least minimal discovery,\" so it struck the complaint without leave to amend and dismissed the action with prejudice. The court later awarded attorneys' fees in T3Media's favor. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 425.16(c)(1). Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal on April 24, 2015.\n\nJURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \"We review the district court's grant of a special motion to strike de novo.\" Graham-Sult v. Clainos, 756 F.3d 724, 735 (9th Cir. 2013). \"The district court's decision not to permit additional discovery pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\" Metabolife Int'l, Inc. v. Wornick, 264 F.3d 832, 839 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\nANALYSIS\n\nCalifornia's anti-SLAPP statute permits defendants to file a \"special motion to strike\" any \"cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue.\" Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 425.16(b)(1). \"The anti-SLAPP statute was enacted to allow for early dismissal of meritless first amendment cases aimed at chilling expression through costly, time-consuming litigation.\" Batzel v. Smith, 333 F.3d 1018, 1024 (9th Cir. 2003) (quotation marks omitted). Its \"burden-shifting mechanism\" weeds out lawsuits \"brought to deter common citizens from exercising their political or legal rights or to punish them for doing so.\" Manzari v. Associated Newspapers Ltd., 830 F.3d 881, XXXXXXXXX (9th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAt step one of the anti-SLAPP analysis, \"the moving defendant must make a prima facie showing that the plaintiff's suit arises from an act in furtherance of the defendant's constitutional right to free speech.\" Makaeff v. Trump Univ., LLC, 715 F.3d 254, 261 (9th Cir. 2013). At step two, assuming that showing has been made, the burden shifts to the plaintiff \"to establish a reasonable probability that it will prevail on its claim[s].\" Id.\n\nHere, plaintiffs concede that their suit arises from acts in furtherance of T3Media's right to free speech. That conclusion is sound because their claims stem from the publication and distribution of expressive photographs over the Internet.[3] It is thus incumbent on plaintiffs to demonstrate a reasonable probability of prevailing on their challenged claims. T3Media insists that feat is impossible because the federal Copyright Act preempts plaintiffs' claims. We agree.\n\nPreemption under Section 301 of the Copyright Act\n\nThe Copyright Act affords copyright owners the \"exclusive rights\" to display, perform, reproduce, or distribute copies of a copyrighted work, to authorize others to do those things, and to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106. The copyright, in other words, gives the owner \"the right to control the work,\" including the decision whether or not to make the work available to the public. Laws v. Sony Music Entm't, Inc., 448 F.3d 1134, 1137 (9th Cir. 2006).\n\nSection 301 of the Act seeks \"to preempt and abolish any rights under the common law or statutes of a State that are equivalent to copyright and that extend to works,\" so long as the rights fall \"within the scope of the Federal copyright law.\" H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, at 130 (1976). \"We have adopted a two-part test,\" in accordance with section 301, \"to determine whether a state law claim is preempted by the Act.\" Laws, 448 F.3d at 1137. First, we decide \"whether the `subject matter' of the state law claim falls within the subject matter of copyright as described in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 103.\" Id. Second, assuming it does, we determine \"whether the rights asserted under state law are equivalent to the rights contained in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106, which articulates the exclusive rights of copyright holders.\" Id. at 1138.\n\nHere, the parties joust solely with respect to step one and assert competing rules that seek to define the boundary between copyright preemption and state law rights of publicity. Plaintiffs maintain that photograph-based publicity-right claims categorically fall outside the subject matter of copyright because such claims protect an individual's persona, which itself cannot be fixed in a tangible medium of expression. T3Media, by contrast, insists that the publicity right protects against the non-consensual use of one's name or likeness on merchandise or in advertising. T3Media would permit publicity-right claims to proceed in those contexts, but find preemption where, as here, a likeness has been captured in an artistic work and the work itself is being distributed for personal use.\n\nThe right of publicity seeks to prevent commercial exploitation of an individual's identity without that person's consent. See Hilton v. Hallmark Cards, 599 F.3d 894, 910 (9th Cir. 2009) (stating that the \"core\" of the right of publicity is preventing \"merchandising [of] a celebrity's image without that person's consent\"); Facenda v. N.F.L. Films, Inc., 542 F.3d 1007, 1031 (3rd Cir. 2008) (stating that the \"core\" of the publicity right \"is the right not to have one's identity used in advertising\"); Toney v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 406 F.3d 905, 910 (7th Cir. 2005) (\"The basis of a right of publicity claim concerns the message\u2014whether the plaintiff endorses, or appears to endorse the product in question.\"). Mindful of that premise, we conclude that a publicity-right claim is not preempted when it targets non-consensual use of one's name or likeness on merchandise or in advertising. But when a likeness has been captured in a copyrighted artistic visual work and the work itself is being distributed for personal use, a publicity-right claim interferes with the exclusive rights of the copyright holder, and is preempted by section 301 of the Copyright Act.\n\nHere, Maloney and Judge do not contend that their likenesses were ever used on merchandise or in advertising. They challenge instead the copyright holder's decision to distribute the copyrighted images themselves by selling consumers a non-exclusive license to download a chosen photograph from the NCAA Photo Library for non-commercial art use. Under these circumstances, the publicity-right claims and the derivative UCL claim challenge \"control of the artistic work itself.\" Laws, 448 F.3d at 1142. Because plaintiffs seek to hold T3Media liable for exercising rights governed exclusively by copyright law, the claims are preempted by section 301 of the Copyright Act.\n\nWe derive these conclusions from the text of the Copyright Act, our precedents, the reasoning of other circuits, and a leading copyright treatise.\n\n1. Step One-The subject matter of the state law claims falls within the subject matter of copyright.\n\na. The statutory text and our precedents.\n\nThe \"subject matter of copyright\" embodies \"original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression . . . from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a). \"Works of authorship include,\" among other things, \"pictorial\" works. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 102(a), (a)(5). Additionally, \"[a] work is `fixed' in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in a copy . . . is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of time of more than transitory duration.\" Id. \u00a7 101.\n\nHere, the publicity-right claims arise from the licensing of photographs, which plaintiffs concede are expressive \"pictorial\" works to which \"[a] photographer contributes some original elements.\"[4] There is also no doubt that a photograph is \"sufficiently permanent\" to permit it to be perceived \"for more than transitory duration.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The \"`subject matter' of the state law claim[s]\"\u2014the photographs\u2014therefore appears to fall within the subject matter of copyright. Laws, 448 F.3d at 1137.\n\nPlaintiffs resist this conclusion by drilling down on the content of a publicity-right claim. Plaintiffs maintain that the right of publicity\u2014as it pertains to photographs\u2014 protects against exploitation of an individual's \"likeness\" or \"persona.\" Since those attributes \"exist independent of any single photograph,\" plaintiffs argue that photograph-based publicity-right claims categorically fall outside the \"subject matter of copyright.\" In other words, plaintiffs insist they do not assert any right in the particular photographic \"works of authorship\" at issue here. Instead, they claim that \"the personal attributes protected by the right of publicity . . . cannot be `fixed' in copyrightable form in the same way as an actor's performance or an author's writings.\"[5]\n\nPlaintiffs draw support for their position primarily from Downing v. Abercrombie & Fitch, 265 F.3d 994 (9th Cir. 2001). There, clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch developed a surfing theme for its catalog, which was the company's \"largest advertising vehicle.\" Id. at 999. As part of the campaign, Abercrombie purchased photographs depicting the plaintiffs taking part in the 1965 Makaha International Surf Championship in Hawaii. Id. at 1000. Abercrombie used the photographs in a section of the catalog entitled \"Surf Nekkid.\" Id. It also \"decided to create t-shirts, exactly like those worn by the [plaintiffs] in the photograph, for sale in the upcoming issue.\" Id. These \"Final Heat Tees\" appeared in the catalog for sale two pages after the pictures of the plaintiffs. Id. Abercrombie did not obtain at any time the plaintiffs' permission to use the photographs in the catalog. Id.\n\nWe held that section 301 of the Copyright Act did not preempt plaintiffs' publicity-right claims. Id. at 1005. We reasoned that \"it is not the publication of the photograph itself, as a creative work of authorship, that is the basis for [plaintiffs'] claims, but rather, it is the use of the [plaintiffs'] likenesses and their names pictured in the published photograph.\" Id. at 1003. We observed that \"[a] person's name or likeness is not a work of authorship within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102.\" Id. at 1004. \"This is true,\" we said, \"notwithstanding the fact that [plaintiffs'] names and likenesses are embodied in a copyrightable photograph.\"[6] Id.\n\nContrary to plaintiffs' argument, Downing did not mint a categorical rule that publicity-right claims \"relating to a likeness in a photograph\" are not subject to preemption. Instead, we said that when the \"use\" of a likeness forms the \"basis\" of a publicity-right claim, the claim is not preempted. Downing, 265 F.3d at 1103201204. We did not state that a likeness is the \"basis\" of a publicity-right claim any time it is fixed in a photograph. The crux of the issue is thus deciding when a publicity-right claim seeks to vindicate misuse of an individual's likeness, as opposed to merely interfering with the distribution, display, or performance of a copyrighted work.\n\nOn that point, plaintiffs rely almost entirely on the idea that a theoretical line should separate publicity-right claims based on photographs from other works protected by the Copyright Act. They insist that \"[a] different preemption rule applies to right-of-publicity claims arising from performances in film and sound recordings as opposed to those arising from a mere likeness in a photograph,\" and that the latter type of claim is not subject to preemption because \"[u]nlike a performance, a person's mere likeness is not a copyrightable contribution to a photograph.\"\n\nThe text of the Copyright Act does not support plaintiffs' construction. Section 301 draws no distinction among different types of copyrighted works when it comes to federal preemption.[7] See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(a). It directs attention to sections 102 and 103, which list the categories of works in which copyright protection subsists, suggesting that the same preemption rule applies to all works that are contained within the \"subject matter of copyright.\" Id. \u00a7 102. Given that \"pictorial\" works appear on that list alongside \"motion pictures\" and \"sound recordings,\" id. \u00a7 102(a)(5)2012(7), there is no textual basis to carve out a preemption rule that applies solely to photographs.\n\nMoreover, our precedents clarify that the distinction pertinent to the preemption of a publicity-right claim is not the type of copyrightable work at issue, but rather the way in which one's name or likeness is affected by the use of the copyrighted work.\n\nFor example, in Downing, the publicity-right claim was not permitted to proceed simply because an individual's likeness was fixed in a photograph. Indeed, it was \"not the publication of the photograph itself, as a creative work of authorship,\" that formed the basis of the publicity-right claim. 265 F.3d at 1103. Instead, it was the unauthorized \"use of the [plaintiffs'] likenesses\" to advertise Abercrombie products, and the creation of \"t-shirts, exactly like those worn by the [plaintiffs] in the photograph, for sale\" in Abercrombie's catalog. Id. The plaintiffs sustained injury to their individual \"personas\" because their likenesses were exploited commercially without their consent. The plaintiffs were not seeking to use the right of publicity simply to prevent \"publication\" of an artistic, visual work.\n\nLaws bolsters the interpretation that preemption turns on how a copyrighted photograph is used. In particular, Laws distinguished Downing as a case \"involv[ing] photographs used in advertising.\" Id. at 1141 (emphasis added). We observed that \"Abercrombie went well beyond the mere republication of the photograph. . . . Rather, it published the photo in connection with a broad surf-themed advertising campaign, identified the plaintiffs-surfers by name, and offered for sale the same t-shirts worn by the plaintiffs in the photo.\" Id. Importantly, we said that \"[Abercrombie] had suggested that the surfers had endorsed Abercrombie's t-shirts. Accordingly, [Downing] concluded that `it is not the publication of the photograph itself . . . that is the basis for [plaintiffs'] claims, but rather, it is the use of the [plaintiffs'] likenesses and their names pictured in the published photographs.'\"[8] Id. (quoting Downing, 265 F.3d at 1003) (emphasis added). Laws strongly implies that misuse of an individual's likeness is the \"basis\" of a publicity-right claim when the name or image is exploited in advertising or on merchandise. It correspondingly implies that one's likeness does not form the basis of a publicity-right claim when \"the tort action challenges control of the artistic work itself,\" id. at 1142, or involves \"the mere republication of the photograph,\" id. at 1141.\n\nIn further support of this interpretation, Laws appears to reject plaintiffs' reading of Fleet v. CBS Inc., 50 Cal. App. 4th 1911 (1996). In Fleet, the plaintiffs were actors in a film, White Dragon, to which the defendant, CBS, Inc., owned the copyright. Id. at 1914. Having been denied certain compensation, plaintiffs sued CBS alleging that CBS \"did not have permission to utilize their names, pictures, or likenesses in conjunction with any exploitation of the film.\" Id. CBS released the film anyway and included a picture of one of the plaintiffs \"on the packaging and [in] advertising materials.\" Id. at 1915. The court held that section 301 of the Copyright Act preempted the plaintiffs' publicity-right claims. Id. at 1919. It \"agree[d] that as a general proposition Civil Code section 3344 is intended to protect rights which cannot be copyrighted.\" Id. But it found that the \"[plaintiffs'] analysis crumbles in the face of one obvious fact: their individual performances in the film White Dragon were copyrightable.\" Id. Once the \"performances were put on film, they became `dramatic work[s]' `fixed in [a] tangible medium of expression.'\" Id. (quoting 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)). \"At that point,\" the court said, \"the performances came within the scope or subject matter of copyright law protection.\" Id. at 1919201220. Given that the publicity-right claims sought \"only to prevent CBS from reproducing and distributing [plaintiffs'] performances in the film,\" the court concluded that \"the[] claims must be preempted by federal copyright law.\" Id. at 1919.\n\nMaloney and Judge read Fleet's holding to be limited to preemption of dramatic performances, and not to include photographs, because it observes that \"[t]he celebrity who has merely had his picture taken has not engaged in a `dramatic work' or other `work of authorship,' and, as Professor Nimmer said, would be afforded no protection under federal copyright law.\" Id. at 1920. They believe Fleet supports their line between photographs and dramatic performances because Fleet adds \"if not for state law, [the celebrity who had his picture taken] would have no remedy against those who would misappropriate his image for their own gain.\" Id. (emphasis added). The \"state law,\" of course, is the right of publicity, so plaintiffs read Fleet to support a dichotomy between likenesses in photographs and likenesses in other copyrightable works.\n\nLaws explains that in Fleet, however, \"[s]ince CBS's use of plaintiffs' likenesses did not extend beyond the use of the copyrighted material it held, there was no right of publicity at issue, aside from the actors' performances.\" Id. at 1143 (emphasis added). Laws does not read Fleet, as plaintiffs contend, to draw a line between photographs and performances. Instead, it endorses the practice of looking at how one's likeness is affected by \"the use of the copyrighted material\"\u2014whether that material is a photograph or something else.\n\nLaws itself illustrates the same point. There, Debra Laws recorded a song, \"Very Special,\" to which Elektra obtained the copyright. Id. at 1136. Sony then obtained a license from Elektra to sample Laws' recording of \"Very Special\" in a song by Jennifer Lopez and L.L. Cool J. Id. After the song became a hit, Laws brought publicity-right claims alleging that Sony's use of \"Very Special\" misappropriated her name and voice. Id. We held that section 301 of the Copyright Act preempted the publicity-right claims. Id.\n\nWe distinguished cases where the defendant obtained a license to a song and then imitated the singer's voice, which we said did not necessitate preemption because misappropriation of the voice itself was the subject of those publicity-right claims. Id. at 1140201241. By contrast, we concluded \"it is clear that federal copyright law preempts a claim alleging misappropriation of one's voice when the entirety of the allegedly misappropriated vocal performance is contained within a copyrighted medium.\" Id. at 1141. Applying that rule, we concluded that Laws's publicity-right claim \"challenge[d] control of the artistic work itself\" and \"could hardly be more closely related to the subject matter of the Copyright Act\" because Sony had merely licensed copyrighted content and \"did not use Laws's image, name, or the voice recording in any promotional materials.\" Id. at 1142.\n\nLaws is significant in another respect\u2014it considered the argument \"that the subject matter of a copyright claim and a right of publicity claim are substantively different.\" Id. at 1139. Like plaintiffs here, Laws argued \"that a copyright claim protects ownership rights to a work of art, while a right of publicity claim concerns the right to protect one's persona and likeness.\" Id. Sony responded that \"the subject matter of a right of publicity [claim] in one's voice is not different from a copyright claim when the voice is embodied within a copyrighted sound recording.\" Id. Sony added that \"once a voice becomes part of a sound recording in a fixed tangible medium it comes within the subject matter of copyright.\" Id.\n\nWe sided with Sony. We acknowledged that \"California law recognizes an assertable interest in the publicity associated with one's voice.\" Id. at 1141. But again, we held \"that federal copyright law preempts a claim alleging misappropriation of one's voice when the entirety of the allegedly misappropriated vocal performance is contained within a copyrighted medium.\" Id.\n\nFinally, our most recent decision in this area further buttresses the concept that whether a right of publicity claim is preempted turns on the way in which one's name or likeness is affected by the use of a copyrighted work. In Jules Jordan Video, Inc. v. 144942 Canada Inc., 617 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2010), an actor who retained the copyright to the adult films in which he performed sued a video company for \"replic[ating] and distribut[ing] a number of [his] copyrighted DVDs without license or authority.\" Id. at 1151. The actor brought publicity-right claims alleging that the defendants \"misappropriated his name and `persona,' in addition to his dramatic performance.'\" Id. at 1153. The actor contended that his publicity rights were offended by the \"unauthorized reproduction, counterfeiting, and sale\" of his copyrighted works. Id. Thus, he maintained, \"the factual basis of his right of publicity claim was the unauthorized reproduction of his performance on the DVDs.\" Id. at 1154.\n\nWe held that the Copyright Act preempted the publicity-right claims because the actor's assertion that \"defendants misappropriated his name and persona [wa]s based entirely on the misappropriation of the DVDs and [the actor's] performance therein.\" Id. at 1153. In other words, the actor was objecting to the unauthorized distribution and republication of a copyrighted work, not the exploitation of his likeness on an unrelated product or in advertising. We also considered the actor's argument \"that it is the use of his name and likeness on the covers of the counterfeit DVDs that violated his right of publicity.\" Id. at 1154. We concluded that even under that theory, the publicity-right claims would still be preempted because \"the pictures on the covers of the DVDs are `still shots' of the copyrighted video performance.\" Id.\n\nIn sum, our cases clarify that a publicity-right claim may proceed when a likeness is used non-consensually on merchandise or in advertising. But where a likeness has been captured in a copyrighted artistic visual work and the work itself is being distributed for personal use, a publicity-right claim is little more than a thinly disguised copyright claim because it seeks to hold a copyright holder liable for exercising his exclusive rights under the Copyright Act.[9]\n\nb. Persuasive authority.\n\nA trio of cases out of the Third and Eighth Circuits lends further support to this conclusion. In Facenda v. N.F.L. Films, Inc., 542 F.3d 1007 (3rd Cir. 2008), the Third Circuit considered a clash between \"the right of publicity\" and \"the exploitation of a defendant's copyright.\" Id. at 1028. The plaintiff had narrated several NFL films, and the defendant repurposed some of those copyrighted clips for use \"in a cable-television production about the football video game `Madden NFL 06.'\" Id. at 1011. Consistent with our holding that there is no categorical preemption rule separating photographs from everything else, the court stated that \"[w]here a defendant in a right-of-publicity claim obtained a copyright in a work featuring the plaintiff, courts must separate legitimate exploitations of what Congress intended to be a copyright holder's exclusive rights from particular uses that infringe the right of publicity.\" Id. at 1028 (emphasis added).\n\nTurning to that task, the court observed that \"when defendants use the work `for the purposes of trade,' such as in an advertisement, plaintiffs' right-of-publicity claims have not been held to be preempted.\" Id. at 1029 (citing NIMMER \u00a7 1.01[B][3][b][iv][l]). Conversely, \"when defendants' uses constitute `expressive works,' right-of-publicity claims have been preempted.\" Id.\n\nApplying that distinction, the Third Circuit concluded that preemption was not appropriate because \"[t]he NFL used the sound recordings of [the plaintiff's] voice in a television production promoting the video game.\" Id. at 1030. This was \"akin to advertising,\" id., and the \"core\" of the publicity right, according to the court, \"is the right not to have one's identity used in advertising.\"[10] Id. at 1031.\n\nIn Ray v. ESPN, Inc., 783 F.3d 1140 (8th Cir. 2015), the Eighth Circuit applied the same distinction that guided the Third Circuit in Facenda. The plaintiff in Ray was a professional wrestler whose matches were filmed. Id. at 1141. Defendant ESPN re-telecast those films without obtaining the plaintiff's consent. Id. at 1141201242. The court found that the filming of the plaintiff's wrestling performances \"clearly generated\" an original work of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Id. at 1143. It thus concluded that the subject matter of the publicity-right claim fell within the subject matter of copyright because the claim was based on the distribution of copyrighted material. Id. In response to the plaintiff's argument that misuse of his likeness was the \"true focal point\" of the case, the court maintained that the publicity-right claim was preempted because \"ESPN did not use [the plaintiff's] likeness or name in an advertisement without his permission to promote its commercial products.\" Id. at 1143201244 (internal quotation mark omitted).\n\nA year later, the Eighth Circuit revisited the issue in Dryer v. National Football League, 814 F.3d 938 (8th Cir. 2016). There, three NFL players argued that their publicity rights were violated by use of their game footage in various NFL films, which subsequently were licensed and broadcast to the public. Id. at 941. They maintained that their \"performances in football games\" were \"part of their identities rather than `fixed' works eligible for copyright protection.\" Id. at 942. The court acknowledged that athletic performances are not copyrightable, but found \"the Copyright Act specifically includes within its purview fixed recordings of such live performances.\"[11] Id. Continuing, the court observed that \"a right-of-publicity suit challenging the use of a copyrighted work in a commercial advertisement could have purposes unrelated to the aims of copyright law.\" Id. at 943 (emphasis added). But it said that \"[w]hen a right-of-publicity suit challenges the expressive, non-commercial use of a copyrighted work, . . . that suit seeks to subordinate the copyright holder's right to exploit the value of that work to the plaintiff's interest in controlling the work's dissemination.\" Id. Because the plaintiffs \"d[id] not challenge the NFL's use of their likenesses or identities in any context other than the publication of th[e] game footage,\" the court held that the right-of-publicity claims fell within the subject matter of copyright. Id. at 942.\n\nA leading copyright treatise invoked by the Third and Eighth Circuits further bolsters our conclusion. Nimmer on Copyright suggests that the right of publicity should be construed in accordance with the Restatement of Unfair Competition, \"which limits liability to misappropriation for the purposes of trade.\" See NIMMER \u00a7 1.01[B][3][b][iv] (internal quotation marks omitted). According to the Restatement, \"[t]he name, likeness, and other indicia of a person's identity are used `for purposes of trade'\" if they are used \"in advertising the user's goods or services, or are placed on merchandise marketed by the user, or are used in connection with services rendered by the user.\" Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition \u00a7 47. Use for \"purposes of trade\" would not ordinarily include \"the use of a person's identity in news reporting, commentary, entertainment, works of fiction or nonfiction, or in advertising that is incidental to such uses.\" Id.\n\nThe \"use for trade\" considerations can almost perfectly distinguish between the cases finding preemption[12] and those permitting publicity-right claims to proceed.[13] As our precedents reflect, the crucial distinction is not between categories of copyrightable works, but how those copyrighted works are used.[14]\n\nc. Application\n\nAs noted, Maloney and Judge do not allege that their names and likenesses were ever used in connection with the sale of any merchandise. Nor do they contend that their likenesses were ever used in any advertising. Instead, the copyrighted images themselves were licensed to individuals for \"non-commercial art use.\" Moreover, the licensees of the Maloney and Judge photos did not obtain \"any right or license to use the name or likeness of any individual . . . in connection with or as an express or implied endorsement of any product or service.\"\n\nPlaintiffs' publicity-right claims and the derivative UCL claim challenge \"control of the artistic work itself.\" Laws, 448 F.3d at 1142. Pursuant to Laws, the subject matter of the state law claims therefore falls within the subject matter of copyright.\n\nWe believe that our holding strikes the right balance by permitting athletes to control the use of their names or likenesses on merchandise or in advertising, while permitting photographers, the visual content licensing industry, art print services, the media, and the public, to use these culturally important images for expressive purposes. Plaintiffs' position, by contrast, would give the subject of every photograph a de facto veto over the artist's rights under the Copyright Act, and destroy the exclusivity of rights that Congress sought to protect by enacting the Copyright Act.[15]\n\n2. Step Two-The rights plaintiffs assert are equivalent to rights within the general scope of copyright.\n\nAt the second step, we determine whether the rights plaintiffs assert under state law are \"equivalent to rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section 106 of the Copyright Act.\" Laws, 448 F.3d at 1143 (quoting Del Madera Props. v. Rhodes & Gardner, 820 F.2d 973, 977 (9th Cir. 1987)). Section 106 affords copyright owners the \"exclusive rights\" to display, perform, reproduce, or distribute copies of a copyrighted work, to authorize others to do those things, and to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106. \"To survive preemption, the state cause of action must protect rights which are qualitatively different from the copyright rights. The state claim must have an extra element which changes the nature of the action.\" Laws, 448 F.3d at 1143 (quoting Del Madera, 820 F.2d at 977).\n\nAs a threshold matter, plaintiffs waived any argument that the rights they assert are not equivalent to rights within the general scope of copyright. They did not argue the issue in their briefs, and we do not review issues raised only by amicus curiae. Russian River Watershed Prot. Comm. v. City of Santa Rosa, 142 F.3d 1136, 1141 (9th Cir. 1998). Even had they made the argument, the district court nonetheless was correct to conclude that the rights plaintiffs assert are no different than the rights contained within the general scope of the Copyright Act.\n\nThe complaint asserts statutory and common law publicity-right claims, and a claim for a violation of the UCL. Plaintiffs, however, do not identify any use of their likenesses independent of the display, reproduction, and distribution of the copyrighted material in which they are depicted. We have held that under those circumstances, none of plaintiffs' claims is qualitatively different from a copyright claim. See Laws, 448 F.3d at 1144 (holding that \"[t]he mere presence of an additional element (`commercial use') in section 3344 is not enough to qualitatively distinguish [a] right of publicity claim from a claim in copyright\"); see also id. at 1143201244 (\"squarely reject[ing]\" the argument that a UCL claim is qualitatively different than a copyright claim under circumstances analogous to here).[16]\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nUnder the circumstances presented here, the \"`subject matter' of the state law claim[s] falls within the subject matter of copyright\" and \"the rights asserted under state law are equivalent to the rights contained in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106.\" Laws, 448 F.3d at 1137, 1138. The federal Copyright Act therefore preempts the plaintiffs' publicity-right claims and the derivative UCL claim. In light of that holding, plaintiffs' cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability of prevailing on their challenged claims. The district court did not err in granting T3Media's special motion to strike.[17]\n\nWe AFFIRM the district court's order granting T3Media's special motion to strike and dismissing plaintiffs' claims without leave to amend. Appellants shall bear costs on appeal. Fed. R. App. P. 39(a)(2).\n\n[*] The Honorable Edward R. Korman, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.\n\n[**] This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\n[1] For example, the caption accompanying a picture of Magic Johnson provided: \"Michigan State's Earvin `Magic' Johnson (33) looks pleased with his performance during the NCAA National Basketball Championships in Salt Lake City, UT, Special Events Center. Johnson was named Most Outstanding Player during the tournament with 17 rebounds and 53 points. Michigan State defeated Indiana State 75-64 to win the title.\"\n\n[2] \"A common law cause of action for appropriation of name or likeness may be pleaded by alleging (1) the defendant's use of the plaintiff's identity; (2) the appropriation of plaintiff's name or likeness to defendant's advantage, commercially or otherwise; (3) lack of consent; and (4) resulting injury.\" Fleet v. CBS, Inc., 50 Cal. App. 4th 1911, 1918 (1996). In addition, \"to plead the statutory remedy provided in Civil Code section 3344, there must also be an allegation of a knowing use of the plaintiff's name, photograph or likeness for purposes of advertising or solicitation or purchases.\" Id. Further, \"judicial construction of section 3344 has imposed an additional requirement. A `direct' connection must be alleged between the use and the commercial purpose.\" Id. Lastly, plaintiffs' UCL claim is derivative of their publicity-right claims because it invokes alleged publicity-right violations as its basis.\n\n[3] The anti-SLAPP statute recognizes four categories of protected speech and petitioning, including \"any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest,\" Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 425.16(e)(3), and \"any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,\" id. \u00a7 425.16(e)(4). T3Media's conduct fits within the former category because it posted the photographs on Paya.com and \"[w]eb sites accessible to the public . . . are `public forums' for purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute.\" Barrett v. Rosenthal, 40 Cal. 4th 33, 41 n.4 (2006); see also Safari Club Int'l v. Rudolph, 845 F.3d 1250, 1258201260 (9th Cir. 2017) (defendant's posting of video on YouTube satisfied \u00a7 425.16(e)(4)). T3Media's conduct also fits within the latter category because the photographs memorialize cherished moments in NCAA sports history, and California defines \"an issue of public interest\" broadly. See Nygard, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula, 159 Cal. App. 4th 1027, 1042201244 (2008) (concluding an issue of public interest is \"any\" issue in which the public is interested); Rivero v. Am. Fed'n of State, Cty., and Mun. Emps., AFL-CIO, 105 Cal. App. 4th 913, 920, 924 (2003).\n\n[4] Amici Associated Press et al. insist that \"[p]hotographers use their tools and artistic judgment by manipulating lighting, angle, positioning, and timing.\"\n\n[5] See also MELVILLE B. NIMMER & DAVID NIMMER, NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT \u00a7 1.01[B][1][c] (Matthew Bender, Rev. Ed. 2016) [hereinafter \"NIMMER\"] (\"The `work' that is the subject of the right of publicity is the persona, i.e., the name and likeness of a celebrity or other individual. A persona can hardly be said to constitute a `writing' of an `author' within the meaning of the Copyright Clause of the Constitution.\"); J. THOMAS MCCARTHY, THE RIGHTS OF PUBLICITY AND PRIVACY \u00a7 11:52 (2d ed. 2016) [hereinafter \"MCCARTHY\"] (\"The picture is not the person. . . . There is only one underlying `persona' of a person protected by the right of publicity. . . . [T]he exact image in [a] photograph is not the underlying `right' asserted in a right of publicity case.\").\n\n[6] Downing relied on two other decisions that plaintiffs likewise rely on here. In Brown v. Ames, 201 F.3d 654 (5th Cir. 2000), a record company misappropriated \"the names and likenesses\" of \"individual blues musicians, songwriters, [and] music producers\" on the company's CD's, tapes, catalogs, and posters. Id. at 656201257. The Fifth Circuit found that preemption does not apply because \"the tort of misappropriation of a name or likeness protects a person's persona[,]\" and \"[a] persona does not fall within the subject matter of copyright.\" Id. at 658. In KNB Enterprises v. Matthews, 78 Cal. App. 4th 362 (2000), the defendant displayed some of the plaintiff's erotic photographs on its website to attract viewers to the site, where it charged customers a monthly fee to view similar photographs. Id. at 366. The court declined to find that the plaintiffs' publicity-right claims were subject to preemption \"because a human likeness is not copyrightable, even if captured in a photograph.\" Id. at 365. Neither decision supports plaintiffs' argument here because both cases involve the use of an individual's likeness on unrelated merchandise or in advertising.\n\n[7] Section 301(a) provides that\n\nOn and after January 1, 1978, all legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section 106 in works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression and come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by sections 102 and 103, whether created before or after that date and whether published or unpublished, are governed exclusively by this title. Thereafter, no person is entitled to any such right or equivalent right in any such work under the common law or statutes of any State.\n\n17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(a) (emphasis added).\n\n[8] Laws also distinguished Brown\u2014a case plaintiffs rely on\u2014as one where preemption was not appropriate because the likenesses were used on \"compact disks, tapes, catalogs, and posters.\" Laws, 448 F.3d at 1141 (citing Brown, 201 F.3d at 656201257).\n\n[9] The fact that the non-exclusive licenses were sold for a profit and their price does not alter our analysis. The copyrighted works in Laws and Jules Jordan were also sold, but the publicity-right claims were still preempted. See Laws, 448 F.3d at 1136; Jules Jordan, 617 F.3d at 11502012 51. More to the point, T3Media's decision to license expressive works for a fee does not change the fact that the publicity-right claims target the display and distribution of copyrighted photographs for personal use. Moreover, copyright holders are allowed to commercially exploit their copyrights by exercising their exclusive rights under the Copyright Act.\n\n[10] The Third Circuit also \"emphasize[d] that courts must circumscribe the right of publicity so that musicians, actors, and other voice artists do not get a right that extends beyond commercial advertisements to other works of artistic expression.\" Facenda, 542 F.3d at 1032. Should courts neglect that task, then \"[i]n addition to copyrights, entertainment companies would need additional licenses for artists' rights of publicity in every case.\" Id. Facenda proceeded with the above analysis under the banner of \"conflict preemption,\" but it treated the framework as similarly applicable to the context of express preemption under section 301. See id. at 1029 n.13. As to express preemption, Facenda found the publicity-right claim was directed to the plaintiff's actual voice, and thus fell outside the subject matter of copyright. Id. at 1027201228.\n\n[11] This holding belies plaintiffs' assertion that their claims should not be preempted because one's likeness is not a \"copyrightable contribution to photograph.\" In Dryer, the athletic performances were likewise not copyrightable contributions, but the claims still fell within the purview of copyright because the performances were fixed in a film\u2014a tangible medium of expression.\n\n[12] The cases finding preemption concern the display or reproduction of copyrighted expressive works. See, e.g., Jules Jordan, 617 F.3d at 1150-51 (distribution of film in which plaintiff acted); Laws, 448 F.3d at 1136 (licensing of song in which plaintiff sang); Fleet, 50 Cal. App. 4th at 1914 (distribution of movie in which plaintiff acted).\n\n[13] These cases involved an imitation of Bette Midler's voice to advertise Ford Cars, Midler v. Ford Motor Co., 849 F.2d 460, 461 (9th Cir. 1988), an imitation of Tom Waits' voice to advertise Doritos, Waits v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 978 F.2d 1093, 1096 (9th Cir. 1992), a robot resembling Vanna White to advertise televisions, White v. Samsung Elecs. Am., Inc., 971 F.2d 1395, 1396 (9th Cir. 1992), robots resembling characters from Cheers used to draw customers to a bar, Wendt v. Host Int'l, Inc., 125 F.3d 806, 809 (9th Cir. 1997), a photograph of a model used to advertise hair products, Toney v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 406 F.3d 905, 907 (7th Cir. 2005), a photograph of surfers used to advertise and sell Abercrombie clothes, Downing, 265 F.3d at 999-1000, images of The Three Stooges used to sell t-shirts, Comedy III Prods., Inc. v. Gary Saderup, Inc., 25 Cal. 4th 387, 393 (2001), use of an announcer's voice to promote a video game, Facenda, 542 F.3d at 1011, and use of student-athlete likenesses to sell a video game, Keller v. Elec. Arts Inc. (In re NCAA Student-Athlete Name & Likeness Licensing Litigation), 724 F.3d 1268, 1271 (9th Cir. 2013).\n\n[14] The McCarthy treatise echoes this conclusion. See MCCARTHY \u00a7 11:52 (\"In some unusual cases, the use of an image of a person may be preempted by copyright law because the only use the defendant is charged with is copying or selling the image itself with no use in advertising and no use to enhance a separate product. For example, a photo archive that merely sells reproductions of photos of athletes is not infringing the right of publicity of the pictured athletes. Since the vast majority of athletes (both professional and amateur) do not own copyright in such photos, they have no right to control the mere reproduction and sale of their photos per se.\").\n\n[15] Notably, Laws expressed a similar concern when describing Fleet. It said that \"the plaintiffs' right of publicity claim was a question of control over the distribution . . . of a movie CBS owned.\" 448 F.3d at 1143. Thus, \"[h]ad the court [not found preemption], each actor could claim that any showing of the film violated his right to control his image and persona.\" Id. We are similarly mindful of the potential for that outcome here.\n\n[16] The elements of a common law right-of-publicity claim are subsumed within those of a statutory claim. See Fleet, 50 Cal. App. 4th at 1918. Thus, Laws necessarily concluded that the singer's common law publicity-right claim asserted rights equivalent to copyright rights. See Laws, 448 F.3d at 1136 (noting singer brought both statutory and common law publicity-right claims).\n\n[17] The district court also did not abuse its discretion in deciding not to permit additional discovery. The identified topics did not bear on the issue of preemption. Moreover, given that the claims are preempted, any additional discovery would have been futile. We also do not reach T3Media's other asserted defenses in light of our holding regarding preemption.", "annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 238}, {"start": 240, "end": 253}, {"start": 254, "end": 300},

Paez, and Morgan Christen, Circuit Judges.\n\nSUMMARY[*]\n\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act\n\nThe panel (1) reversed the district court's holding, on summary judgment, that the defendant was protected by the safe harbor of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act from liability for posting the plaintiff's photographs online and (2) vacated a discovery order.\n\nThe panel held that the safe harbor set forth in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c) would apply if the photographs were posted at the direction of users. The defendant, a social media platform, posted the photographs after a team of volunteer moderators, led by an employee of the defendant, reviewed and approved them. The panel held that whether the photographs were posted at the direction of users depended on whether the acts of the moderators could be attributed to the defendant. Disagreeing with the district court, the panel held that the common law of agency applied to the defendant's safe harbor defense. Because there were genuine factual disputes regarding whether the moderators were the defendant's agents, the panel reversed the district court's summary judgment and remanded the case for trial.\n\nThe panel also discussed the remaining elements of the safe harbor affirmative defense. If an internet service provider shows that the infringing material was posted \"at the direction of the user,\" it must then also show that (1) it lacked actual or red flag knowledge of the infringing material; and (2) it did not financially benefit from infringements that it had the right and ability to control. The panel held that to fully assess actual knowledge, the fact finder must consider not only whether the copyright holder has given notice of the infringement, but also the service provider's subjective knowledge of the infringing nature of the posts. The panel held that to determine whether the defendant had red flag knowledge, the fact finder would need to assess whether it would be objectively obvious to a reasonable person that material bearing a generic watermark or a watermark referring to the plaintiff's website was infringing. When assessing the service provider's right and ability to control the infringements, the fact finder should consider the service provider's procedures that existed at the time of the infringements and whether the service provider had \"something more\" than the ability to remove or block access to posted materials.\n\nFinally, the panel vacated the district court's order denying discovery of the moderators' identities.\n\nOPINION\n\nPAEZ, Circuit Judge.\n\nPlaintiff Mavrix Photographs (\"Mavrix\") appeals the district court's summary judgment in favor of Defendant LiveJournal. Mavrix sued LiveJournal for posting twenty of its copyrighted photographs online. The district court held that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's (\"DMCA\") \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor protected LiveJournal from liability because Mavrix's photographs were posted at the direction of the user. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c).\n\nTo be eligible at the threshold for the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor, LiveJournal must show that the photographs were posted at the direction of the user. Although users submitted Mavrix's photographs to LiveJournal, LiveJournal posted the photographs after a team of volunteer moderators led by a LiveJournal employee reviewed and approved them. Whether these photographs were truly \"posted at the direction of the user,\" or instead whether LiveJournal itself posted the photographs, depends on whether the acts of the moderators can be attributed to LiveJournal. The issue we must decide is whether the common law of agency applies to LiveJournal's safe harbor defense. The district court ruled that the common law of agency does not apply to this analysis. We disagree and conclude that it does. As there are genuine factual disputes regarding whether the moderators are LiveJournal's agents, we reverse the district court's summary judgment and remand for trial.\n\nBecause the district court ruled on the remaining elements of the safe harbor, we also proceed to discuss those elements in order to provide guidance to the district court and parties on remand. Finally, we vacate the district court's order denying discovery of the moderators' identities because the agency determination may affect this analysis.\n\nI.\n\nLiveJournal[1]\n\nLiveJournal is a social media platform. Among other services, it allows users to create and run thematic \"communities\" in which they post and comment on content related to the theme. LiveJournal communities can create their own rules for submitting and commenting on posts.\n\nLiveJournal set up three types of unpaid administrator roles to run its communities. \"Moderators\" review posts submitted by users to ensure compliance with the rules.[2] \"Maintainers\" review and delete posts and have the authority to remove moderators and users from the community. Each community also has one \"owner\" who has the authority of a maintainer, but can also remove maintainers.\n\nLiveJournal protects against copyright infringement in its communities through various mechanisms. LiveJournal follows the formal notice and takedown procedures outlined in the DMCA by designating an agent and form to report infringement, and by promptly removing infringing posts and prohibiting repeat abusers from the community. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1)(C). LiveJournal's Terms of Service instructs users not to \"[u]pload, post or otherwise transmit any Content that infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights.\"\n\nOh No They Didn't! (\"ONTD\")\n\nONTD is a popular LiveJournal community which features up-to-date celebrity news. Users submit posts containing photographs, videos, links, and gossip about celebrities' lives. ONTD moderators review and publicly post some of the submissions. Other users engage in conversations about the celebrity news in the comments section of each post. For example, one of the ONTD posts at issue contained photographs that Mavrix had taken which appeared to show that super-celebrity Beyonc\u00e9 was pregnant. Users speculated in the comments section of that post that Beyonc\u00e9 was indeed pregnant.[3]\n\nLike other LiveJournal communities, ONTD created rules for submitting and commenting on posts. ONTD's rules pertain to both potential copyright infringement and substantive guidance for users. For example, one rule instructs users to \"[i]nclude the article and picture(s) in your post, do not simply refer us off to another site for the goods.\" Another rule provides \"Keep it recent. We don't need a post in 2010 about Britney Spears shaving her head.\" ONTD's rules also include a list of sources from which users should not copy material. The sources on the list have informally requested that ONTD stop posting infringing material. ONTD has also automatically blocked all material from one source that sent ONTD a cease and desist letter.\n\nONTD has nine moderators, six maintainers, and one owner. ONTD users submit proposed posts containing celebrity news to an internal queue. Moderators review the submissions and publicly post approximately one-third of them. Moderators review for substance, approving only those submissions relevant to new and exciting celebrity news. Moderators also review for copyright infringement, pornography, and harassment.\n\nWhen ONTD was created, like other LiveJournal communities, it was operated exclusively by volunteer moderators. LiveJournal was not involved in the day-to-day operation of the site. ONTD, however, grew in popularity to 52 million page views per month in 2010 and attracted LiveJournal's attention. By a significant margin, ONTD is LiveJournal's most popular community and is the only community with a \"household name.\" In 2010, LiveJournal sought to exercise more control over ONTD so that it could generate advertising revenue from the popular community. LiveJournal hired a then active moderator, Brendan Delzer, to serve as the community's full time \"primary leader.\" By hiring Delzer, LiveJournal intended to \"take over\" ONTD, grow the site, and run ads on it.[4]\n\nAs the \"primary leader,\" Delzer instructs ONTD moderators on the content they should approve and selects and removes moderators on the basis of their performance. Delzer also continues to perform moderator work, reviewing and approving posts alongside the other moderators whom he oversees. While Delzer is paid and expected to work full time, the other moderators are \"free to leave and go and volunteer their time in any way they see fit.\" In his deposition, Mark Ferrell, the General Manager of LiveJournal's U.S. office, explained that Delzer \"acts in some capacities as a sort of head maintainer\" and serves in an \"elevated status\" to the other moderators. Delzer, on the other hand, testified at his deposition that he does not serve as head moderator and that ONTD has no \"primary leader.\"\n\nMavrix\n\nMavrix is a celebrity photography company specializing in candid photographs of celebrities in tropical locations. The company sells its photographs to celebrity magazines. According to Mavrix, infringement of its photographs is particularly devastating to its business model. Since Mavrix's photographs break celebrity news, such as the pregnancy of Beyonc\u00e9, infringing posts on sites like ONTD prevent Mavrix from profiting from the sale of the photographs to celebrity magazines.\n\nProcedural History\n\nMavrix filed an action for damages and injunctive relief against LiveJournal alleging copyright infringement on the basis of twenty Mavrix photographs posted on ONTD. ONTD posted the photographs in seven separate posts between 2010 and 2014. Some of these photographs contained either a generic watermark or a specific watermark featuring Mavrix's website \"Mavrixonline.com.\" To the best of his recollection, Delzer did not personally approve the seven posts. LiveJournal has no technological means of determining which moderator approved any given post. Mavrix did not utilize LiveJournal's notice and takedown procedure to notify LiveJournal of the infringements. When Mavrix filed this lawsuit, LiveJournal removed the posts.[5]\n\nDuring discovery, Mavrix filed two motions to compel responses to its interrogatories seeking the identity of the ONTD moderators. The magistrate judge denied the first motion, finding that Mavrix had not met and conferred with LiveJournal in good faith. The magistrate judge denied the second motion to compel because Mavrix failed to notify the anonymous parties of the pending motion. Mavrix moved the district court for review of the magistrate judge's order, which the district court denied on the basis of the moderators' First Amendment right to anonymous internet speech.\n\nLiveJournal moved for summary judgment on the basis of the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor. The district court granted LiveJournal's motion and denied Mavrix's cross-motion for partial summary judgment, concluding that the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor shielded LiveJournal from liability for copyright infringement. Mavrix timely appealed.\n\nII.\n\nWe review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment. Curley v. City of N. Las Vegas, 772 F.3d 629, 631 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Smith v. Clark Cnty. Sch. Dist., 727 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir.2013)). We must determine, \"viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.\" Id.\n\nThe district court's denial of a motion to reconsider a magistrate judge's pretrial discovery order under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a) will be reversed only if \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\" Rivera v. NIBCO, Inc., 364 F.3d 1057, 1063 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing Osband v. Woodford, 290 F.3d 1036, 1041 (9th Cir.2002)).\n\nIII.\n\nA.\n\nThe DMCA strikes a balance between the interests of \"copyright holders in benefitting from their labor; . . . entrepreneurs in having the latitude to invent new technologies without fear of being held liable if their innovations are used by others in unintended infringing ways; and those of the public in having access [to] both . . . .\" Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. v. Fung, 710 F.3d 1020, 1037 (9th Cir. 2013). The DMCA balances these interests by requiring service providers to take down infringing materials when copyright holders notify them of the infringement and by limiting service providers' liability for unintentional infringement through several safe harbors. Ellison v. Robertson, 357 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\nThe DMCA established four safe harbors to \"provide protection from liability for: (1) transitory digital network communications; (2) system caching; (3) information residing on systems or networks at the direction of users; and (4) information location tools.\" Id. at 1076-77 (citing 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(a)-(d)). LiveJournal claimed protection from damages under the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor for \"infringement of copyright by reason of the storage [of material] at the direction of a user.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1). To be eligible at the threshold for the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor, a service provider must show that the infringing material was posted \"at the direction of the user.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1).[6] If it meets that threshold requirement, the service provider must then show that (1) it lacked actual or red flag knowledge of the infringing material; and (2) it did not receive a \"financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity.\" Id.[7] Because the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor is an affirmative defense, LiveJournal must establish \"beyond controversy every essential element,\" and failure to do so will render LiveJournal ineligible for the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor's protection. See S. Cal. Gas Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885, 888 (9th Cir. 2003); see also UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Shelter Capital Partners LLC, 718 F.3d 1006, 1013 (9th Cir. 2013).\n\nB.\n\n1.\n\nLiveJournal must make a threshold showing that Mavrix's photographs were posted on ONTD at the direction of the user. The district court held that although moderators screened and publicly posted all of the ONTD posts, the posts were at the direction of the user. The district court focused on the users' submission of infringing photographs to LiveJournal rather than LiveJournal's screening and public posting of the photographs. A different safe harbor, \u00a7 512(a), protects service providers from liability for the passive role they play when users submit infringing material to them. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(a); see, e.g., Perfect 10, Inc. v. CCBill LLC, 488 F.3d 1102, 1116 (9th Cir. 2007) (describing infringing material passively and temporarily placed on a computer server as within the \u00a7 512(a) safe harbor). The \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor, however, focuses on the service provider's role in publicly posting infringing material on its site. See Shelter Capital, 718 F.3d at 1018; S. Rep. No. 105-190, at 43-44 (1998). Contrary to the district court's view, posting rather than submission is the critical inquiry. See Perfect 10, Inc. v. Giganews, Inc., 847 F.3d 657, 668-69 (9th Cir. 2017) (distinguishing between the service provider's passive role when users \"upload[] infringing content onto [] servers\" and \"any sort of active role\" on the basis of who \"caused the images to be displayed\"). In the context of this case, that inquiry turns on the role of the moderators in screening and posting users' submissions and whether their acts may be attributed to LiveJournal.\n\n2.\n\nMavrix, relying on the common law of agency, argues that the moderators are LiveJournal's agents, making LiveJournal liable for the moderators' acts. The district court erred in rejecting this argument.\n\n\"[S]tatutes are presumed not to disturb the common law, `unless the language of a statute [is] clear and explicit for this purpose.'\" State Eng'r of Nev. v. S. Fork Band of Te-Moak Tribe of W. Shoshone Indians of Nev., 339 F.3d 804, 814 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Norfolk Redevelopment & Hous. Auth. v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co. of Va., 464 U.S. 30, 35 (1983)). Pursuant to this principle, the Supreme Court and this court have applied common law in cases involving federal copyright law, including the DMCA. The Supreme Court has applied the common law of agency in interpreting the Copyright Act. Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730, 751-52 (1989). We have applied the common law of vicarious liability in analyzing the DMCA, reasoning that Congress intended that the DMCA's \"limitations of liability\" be interpreted \"under existing principles of law.\" Ellison, 357 F.3d at 1076-77 (quoting S. Rep. 105-190, at 19 (1998)). We have also applied the common law of agency to determine a service provider's intent to infringe under the DMCA. Fung, 710 F.3d at 1038.\n\nAlong with other courts, we have applied agency law to questions much like the question of LiveJournal's liability for the moderators' acts. We applied agency law to determine whether a service provider was responsible under the DMCA for copyright infringement by its employees. Fung, 710 F.3d at 1038. The Tenth Circuit applied agency law to determine whether a service provider was responsible under the DMCA for copyright infringement by its contractors. See BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Clarity Dig. Grp., LLC, 820 F.3d 1175, 1180 (10th Cir. 2016).[8] Finally, a district court applied agency law to determine whether a service provider was responsible under the DMCA for the acts of moderators. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. v. Fung, No. CV 06-5578 SVW(JCx), 2009 WL 6355911, at *13 n.21 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 2009), aff'd in part, 710 F.3d 1020 (9th Cir. 2013).[9] We therefore have little difficulty holding that common law agency principles apply to the analysis of whether a service provider like LiveJournal is liable for the acts of the ONTD moderators.\n\n3.\n\nIn light of the summary judgment record, we conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the moderators are LiveJournal's agents. The factual dispute is evident when we apply common law agency principles to the evidentiary record.\n\n\"Agency is the fiduciary relationship that arises when one person (a `principal') manifests assent to another person (an `agent') that the agent shall act on the principal's behalf and subject to the principal's control, and the agent manifests assent or otherwise consents so to act.\" Restatement (Third) Of Agency \u00a7 1.01 (Am. Law Inst. 2006). For an agency relationship to exist, an agent must have authority to act on behalf of the principal and \"[t]he person represented [must have] a right to control the actions of the agent.\" Restatement (Third) Of Agency \u00a7 1.01, cmt. c (Am. Law Inst. 2006).\n\nAn agency relationship may be created through actual or apparent authority. Gomez v. Campbell-Ewald Co., 768 F.3d 871, 878 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7 2.01, 2.03, 4.01 (Am. Law Inst. 2006)), cert. granted, 135 S. Ct. 2311, (2015), and aff'd, 136 S. Ct. 663 (2016). Actual authority arises through \"the principal's assent that the agent take action on the principal's behalf.\" Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 3.01 (Am. Law Inst. 2006). LiveJournal argues that it did not assent to the moderators acting on its behalf. Mavrix, however, presented evidence that LiveJournal gave its moderators explicit and varying levels of authority to screen posts. Although LiveJournal calls the moderators \"volunteers,\" the moderators performed a vital function in LiveJournal's business model.[10] There is evidence in the record that LiveJournal gave moderators express directions about their screening functions, including criteria for accepting or rejecting posts. Unlike other sites where users may independently post content, LiveJournal relies on moderators as an integral part of its screening and posting business model. LiveJournal also provides three different levels of authority: moderators review posts to ensure they contain celebrity gossip and not pornography or harassment, maintainers delete posts and can remove moderators, and owners can remove maintainers. Genuine issues of material fact therefore exist regarding whether the moderators had actual authority.\n\nApparent authority arises by \"a person's manifestation that another has authority to act with legal consequences for the person who makes the manifestation, when a third party reasonably believes the actor to be authorized and the belief is traceable to the manifestation.\" Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 3.03 (Am. Law Inst. 2006); see also Hawaiian Paradise Park Corp. v. Friendly Broad. Co., 414 F.2d 750, 756 (9th Cir. 1969). \"The principal's manifestations giving rise to apparent authority may consist of direct statements to the third person, directions to the agent to tell something to the third person, or the granting of permission to the agent to perform acts . . . under circumstances which create in him a reputation of authority. . . .\" Hawaiian Paradise Park, 414 F.2d at 756.\n\nLiveJournal selected moderators and provided them with specific directions. Mavrix presented evidence that LiveJournal users may have reasonably believed that the moderators had authority to act for LiveJournal. One user whose post was removed pursuant to a DMCA notice complained to LiveJournal \"I'm sure my entry does not violate any sort of copyright law. . . . I followed [ONTD's] formatting standards and the moderators checked and approved my post.\" The user relied on the moderators' approval as a manifestation that the post complied with copyright law, and the user appeared to believe the moderators acted on behalf of LiveJournal. Such reliance is likely traceable to LiveJournal's policy of providing explicit roles and authority to the moderators. Accordingly, genuine issues of material fact exist regarding whether there was an apparent authority relationship.\n\nWhether an agency relationship exists also depends on the level of control a principal exerts over the agent. See Hollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2652, 2657-58 (2013) (referring to control as one of \"the basic features of an agency relationship\"); United States v. Bonds, 608 F.3d 495, 505 (9th Cir. 2010) (explaining that the \"the extent of control exercised by the employer\" is the \"essential ingredient\" in determining an agency relationship) (quoting NLRB v. Friendly Cab Co., 512 F.3d 1090, 1096 (9th Cir. 2008). Evidence presented by Mavrix shows that LiveJournal maintains significant control over ONTD and its moderators. Delzer gives the moderators substantive supervision and selects and removes moderators on the basis of their performance, thus demonstrating control. Delzer also exercises control over the moderators' work schedule. For example, he added a moderator from Europe so that there would be a moderator who could work while other moderators slept. Further demonstrating LiveJournal's control over the moderators, the moderators' screening criteria derive from rules ratified by LiveJournal.[11]\n\nOn the other hand, ONTD moderators \"are free to leave and go and volunteer their time in any way they see fit.\" In addition, the moderators can reject submissions for reasons other than those provided by the rules, which calls into question the level of control that LiveJournal exerts over their conduct. This evidence raises genuine issues of material fact regarding the level of control LiveJournal exercised over the moderators. From the evidence currently in the record, reasonable jurors could conclude that an agency relationship existed.\n\n4.\n\nWe turn briefly to a related issue that the fact finder must resolve in the event there is a finding that the moderators are agents of LiveJournal. In that event, the fact finder must assess whether Mavrix's photographs were indeed posted at the direction of the users in light of the moderators' role in screening and posting the photographs. Posts are at the direction of the user if the service provider played no role in posting them on its site or if the service provider carried out activities that were \"narrowly directed\" towards enhancing the accessibility of the posts. See UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Veoh Networks, Inc., 620 F. Supp. 2d 1081, 1092 (C.D. Cal. 2008); see also Shelter Capital, 718 F.3d at 1018. Accessibility-enhancing activities include automatic processes, for example, to reformat posts or perform some technological change. Shelter Capital, 718 F.3d at 1020 (referring to accessibility-enhancing activities as those where the service provider did \"not actively participate in or supervise file uploading\"). Some manual service provider activities that screen for infringement or other harmful material like pornography can also be accessibility-enhancing. Id. at 1012 n.2. Indeed, \u00a7 512(m) of the DMCA provides that no liability will arise from \"a service provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity.\" Id. at 1022 (quoting 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(m)).[12]\n\nThe ONTD moderators manually review submissions and publicly post only about one-third of submissions. The moderators review the substance of posts; only those posts relevant to new and exciting celebrity gossip are approved. The question for the fact finder is whether the moderators' acts were merely accessibility-enhancing activities or whether instead their extensive, manual, and substantive activities went beyond the automatic and limited manual activities we have approved as accessibility-enhancing.\n\n* * *\n\nBecause the district court focused on the users' submission of Mavrix's photographs rather than on ONTD's posting of those photographs and rejected Mavrix's argument that unpaid moderators could be agents of LiveJournal, the district court erred in granting summary judgment to LiveJournal. Genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the moderators were LiveJournal's agents. Accordingly, remand is warranted. In assessing LiveJournal's threshold eligibility for the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor, the fact finder must resolve the factual dispute regarding the moderators' status as LiveJournal's agents and in light of that determination, whether LiveJournal showed that Mavrix's photographs were posted at the direction of the users.\n\nC.\n\nOnce the district court concluded that the moderators were not LiveJournal's agents (except for its employee Delzer), it proceeded to address the two remaining disputed requirements for establishing the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor defense-lack of knowledge of infringements and lack of any financial benefit from infringement that it had the right and ability to control. Because these issues may be contested on remand, we proceed to address them to provide guidance to the district court.\n\n1.\n\nIf LiveJournal shows that it meets the threshold requirement for the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor because the photographs were posted at the direction of the user, LiveJournal must then show that it lacked both actual and red flag knowledge of the infringements. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1)(A). Actual knowledge refers to whether the service provider had subjective knowledge while red flag knowledge turns on whether a reasonable person would objectively know of the infringements. Shelter Capital, 718 F.3d at 1025 (quoting YouTube, Inc., 676 F.3d at 31). Both actual and red flag knowledge refer to knowledge of the specific infringement alleged. Id. at 1023, 1025.\n\nOn remand, the fact finder must first determine whether LiveJournal had actual knowledge of the infringements. A copyright holder's failure to notify the service provider of infringement through the notice and takedown procedure, as Mavrix failed to do here, \"strip[s] it of the most powerful evidence of [actual] knowledge.\" Id. at 1020 (quoting Corbis Corp. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 351 F. Supp. 2d 1090, 1107 (W.D. Wash. 2004)). Such evidence is powerful, but not conclusive, towards showing that a service provider lacked actual knowledge. Id. at 1021. The district court held that LiveJournal lacked actual knowledge of the infringing nature of Mavrix's photographs solely on the basis of Mavrix's failure to notify LiveJournal of the infringements. This was an incomplete assessment of the issue. To fully assess actual knowledge, the fact finder should also assess a service provider's subjective knowledge of the infringing nature of the posts. See, e.g., id. at 1025 (continuing to assess knowledge). Although Delzer does not remember approving the posts and for this reason can be said to lack actual knowledge, Mavrix has not had the opportunity to depose the moderators to determine their subjective knowledge. On remand, the fact finder should determine whether LiveJournal, through its agents, had actual knowledge of the infringing nature of the posts.\n\nIn the event the fact finder determines that LiveJournal lacked actual knowledge of the infringements, it must then assess whether LiveJournal lacked red flag knowledge. Red flag knowledge arises when a service provider is \"aware of facts that would have made the specific infringement `objectively' obvious to a reasonable person.\" Fung, 710 F.3d at 1043 (quoting YouTube, 676 F.3d at 31); see also UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Veoh Networks Inc., 665 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1111 (C.D. Cal. 2009) (describing red flag knowledge as a \"high bar\"). The infringement must be immediately apparent to a non-expert. See Veoh Networks Inc., 665 F. Supp. 2d at 1108; H.R. Rep. 105-551, pt. 2 at 58 (1998) (explaining that infringements must be \"apparent from even a brief and casual viewing\"). Some of the photographs at issue in this case contained either a generic watermark[13] or a watermark containing Mavrix's website, \"Mavrixonline.com.\"[14] To determine whether LiveJournal had red flag knowledge, the fact finder should assess if it would be objectively obvious to a reasonable person that material bearing a generic watermark or a watermark referring to a service provider's website was infringing.\n\n2.\n\nFinally, if the fact finder determines that LiveJournal met the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor threshold requirement (i.e., that the photographs were posted at the direction of the user, see 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1)), and that LiveJournal lacked knowledge of the infringements (see 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1)(A)), then the fact finder should determine whether LiveJournal showed that it did not financially benefit from infringements that it had the right and ability to control. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1)(B).\n\nWe agree with the district court in Io Group, Inc. v. Veoh Networks, Inc. that the fact finder should consider the service provider's procedures that existed at the time of the infringements when assessing the service provider's right and ability to control the infringements. 586 F. Supp. 2d 1132, 1153 (N.D. Cal. 2008). The fact finder should consider the service provider's general practices, not its conduct with respect to the specific infringements.[15] See Shelter Capital, 718 F.3d at 1023, 1030.\n\n\"Right and ability to control\" involves \"something more than the ability to remove or block access to materials posted on a service provider's website.\" Id. (quoting YouTube, Inc., 676 F.3d at 38). The service provider does \"something more\" when it exerts \"high levels of control over activities of users.\" Id. The service provider exerts \"high levels of control,\" for example, when it, \"prescreens sites, gives them extensive advice, prohibits the proliferation of identical sites,\" provides \"detailed instructions regard[ing] issues of layout, appearance, and content,\" and ensures \"that celebrity images do not oversaturate the content.\" Perfect 10, Inc. v. Cybernet Ventures, Inc., 213 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 1173, 1182 (C.D. Cal. 2002); see also Shelter Capital, 718 F.3d at 1030, cited with approval in Perfect 10, 213 F. Supp. 2d 1146.[16]\n\nThe district court concluded that LiveJournal did not have high levels of control such that it had \"something more\" than the right and ability to remove or block access to material posted on ONTD. LiveJournal's rules instruct users on the substance and infringement of their posts. The moderators screen for content and other guidelines such as infringement. Nearly two-thirds of submitted posts are rejected, including on substantive grounds. ONTD maintains a list of sources that have complained about infringement from which users should not submit posts. LiveJournal went so far as to use a tool to automatically block any posts from one source. In determining whether LiveJournal had the right and ability to control infringements, the fact finder must assess whether LiveJournal's extensive review process, infringement list, and blocker tool constituted high levels of control to show \"something more.\"\n\nLiveJournal must also show that it did not derive a financial benefit from infringement that it had the right and ability to control. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1)(B). \"In determining whether the financial benefit criterion is satisfied, courts should take a common-sense, fact-based approach, not a formalistic one.\" S. Rep. No. 105-190, at 44 (1998). The financial benefit need not be substantial or a large proportion of the service provider's revenue. Ellison, 357 F.3d at 1079. In Fung, we held that a financial benefit was shown when \"there was a vast amount of infringing material on [the service provider's] websites . . . supporting an inference that [the service provider's] revenue stream is predicated on the broad availability of infringing materials for [its] users, thereby attracting advertisers.\" 710 F.3d at 1045. On the other hand, the service provider in that case \"promoted advertising by pointing to infringing activity\" and \"attracted primarily visitors who were seeking to engage in infringing activity, as that is mostly what occurred on [the service provider's] sites.\" Id.\n\nLiveJournal derives revenue from advertising based on the number of views ONTD receives. Mavrix presented evidence showing that approximately 84% of posts on ONTD contain infringing material, although LiveJournal contested the validity of this evidence. The fact finder should determine whether LiveJournal financially benefitted from infringement that it had the right and ability to control.\n\nD.\n\nMavrix also challenges the denial of its motions to compel responses to interrogatories seeking the identities of the moderators. The magistrate judge denied both of Mavrix's motions, and on review, the district court upheld the denial, reasoning that the moderators had a First Amendment interest in internet anonymity. When a district court denies reconsideration of a pretrial discovery order under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 72(a), our review is deferential. Upon review of such a ruling we will disturb it only if the complaining party shows clear legal error and actual and substantial prejudice. See Arizona v. City of Tucson, 761 F.3d 1005, 1009 n.2 (9th Cir. 2014); In re Anonymous Online Speakers, 661 F.3d 1168, 1177 (9th Cir. 2011) (describing the standard as \"highly deferential\"). In determining whether First Amendment protections for anonymous speech outweigh the need for discovery, we have applied a multifactor balancing test. See, e.g., In re Anonymous Online Speakers, 661 F.3d at 1174-76 (describing balancing factors).\n\nNotwithstanding the deferential standard of review and complex issues of law that govern this discovery ruling, we vacate the district court's order denying the motion and remand for further consideration. Whether the moderators are agents should inform the district court's analysis of whether Mavrix's need for discovery outweighs the moderators' interest in anonymous internet speech. Given the importance of the agency analysis to the ultimate outcome of the case, and the importance of discovering the moderators' roles to that agency analysis, the district court should also consider alternative means by which Mavrix could formally notify or serve the moderators with process requesting that they appear for their deposition at a date and time certain.\n\nIV.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment to LiveJournal, vacate its order denying discovery, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nREVERSED, VACATED and REMANDED.\n\n[*] This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.\n\n[1] The facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n\n[2] Because moderators, maintainers, and owners all can review posts, we refer to all three as moderators when discussing the act of reviewing posts.\n\n[3] In a more recent post about Beyonc\u00e9, a user speculated that she would perform her song \"Formation\" at the 2016 Super Bowl. Other users commented on the post, debating how Beyonc\u00e9 might incorporate feminist and racial justice themes into her performance. XOXOBLISS, Beyonc\u00e9 Is Performing Formation at the Super Bowl + Celebrities React to Formation, ONTD (Feb. 6, 2016, 05:49 PM), http://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/XXXXXXXXX.html.\n\n[4] When Delzer was hired in 2010, LiveJournal had not yet created the owner administrator position. In 2011, when LiveJournal created the owner position, Delzer was elected by the community and became the owner. After this lawsuit was filed, LiveJournal's parent company became the owner.\n\n[5] Because LiveJournal removed the posts, Mavrix's request for injunctive relief is likely moot.\n\n[6] Section 512(c)(1) provides in relevant part:\n\nA service provider shall not be liable . . . for infringement of copyright by reason of the storage at the direction of a user of material that resides on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the service provider, if the service provider \u2014\n\n(A)(i) does not have actual knowledge that the material or an activity using the material on the system or network is infringing;\n\n(ii) in the absence of such actual knowledge, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent; or\n\n(iii) upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material;\n\n(B) does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity, in a case in which the service provider has the right and ability to control such activity; and\n\n(C) upon notification of claimed infringement . . ., responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing . . . .\n\n17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1).\n\n[7] LiveJournal must also show that it complied with \u00a7 512(c)'s notice and takedown procedure, but that issue is not contested in this case.\n\n[8] The Tenth Circuit held that the service provider's contractors were \"users\" rather than agents under the DMCA. BWP, 820 F.3d at 1180. The court also held that even if the contractors were agents, they were not employees. Id. at 1181. Finally, the court held that even if the contractors were employees, they could still be users. Id. To the extent that BWP's holding contradicts our case law that common law principles of agency apply to the DMCA such that a service provider is liable for the acts of its agents, including its employees, we reject it. See, e.g., Fung, 710 F.3d at 1038 (\"When dealing with corporate or entity defendants, . . . the relevant intent must be that of the entity itself, as defined by traditional agency law principles . . . .\").\n\n[9] Although the district court's order does not specify whether the moderators were paid, the parties' filings before the district court make clear that the moderators were unpaid. See Defendant's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability at 2, Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. v. Fung, No. CV 06-5578 SVW(JCx) (C.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 2009), 2009 WL 6355911; Plaintiff's Reply Statement of Uncontroverted Facts in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability at 6, Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. v. Fung, No. CV 06-5578 SVW(JCx) (C.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 2009), 2009 WL 6355911.\n\n[10] Agents need not receive payment from their principal to be agents. Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 1.01 cmt. d (Am. Law Inst. 2006) (\"Many agents act or promise to act gratuitously.\"); Model Civ. Jury Instr. 9th Cir. 4.4 (2007) (\"One may be an agent without receiving compensation for services.\").\n\n[11] LiveJournal ratified the ONTD rules when Ferrell discussed changing the rules with Delzer and declined to do so. See United States v. Alaska S.S. Co., 491 F.2d 1147, 1155 (9th Cir.1974) (\"Ratification is the affirmance by a person of a prior act which did not bind him but which was done or professedly done on his account. . . .\") (quoting Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 82 (Am. Law Inst. 1958)); see also Gomez, 768 F.3d at 878.\n\n[12] The district court did not assess whether the moderators' review of posts exceeded accessibility-enhancing activities because it focused on submission rather than posting and did not determine whether the moderators were agents. In Shelter Capital, we suggested that accessibility-enhancing activities have a limit when we approved software \"processes that automatically occur when a user uploads\" materials as within accessibility-enhancing activities. 718 F.3d at 1016, 1020. Other circuits have more squarely faced the outer edges of this limit. The Second Circuit found it a close call and remanded when YouTube manually selected videos for front page syndication on the basis of substance. Viacom Int'l, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., 676 F.3d 19, 40 (2d Cir. 2012). The district court on remand held that only those processes \"without manual intervention\" satisfied the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor. Viacom Int'l Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., 940 F. Supp. 2d 110, 123 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). The Fourth Circuit extended accessibility-enhancing activities to include a real estate website's \"cursory\" manual screening to determine whether photographs indeed depicted real estate. CoStar Grp., Inc. v. LoopNet, Inc., 373 F.3d 544, 556 (4th Cir. 2004). The fact finder should determine whether LiveJournal's manual, substantive review process went beyond the automatic processes we have approved as accessibility-enhancing activities such that the posts were still at the direction of the user.\n\n[13] Congress explained that red flag knowledge includes \"customary indicia . . . such as a standard and accepted digital watermark.\" H.R. Rep. 105-55, pt. 1, at 25 (1998). But see Veoh Networks Inc., 665 F. Supp. 2d at 1115 (declining to rely on this report because it addressed a \"version of the DMCA that is significantly different in its text and structure than the version that Congress ultimately adopted\").\n\n[14] The district court stated that Delzer was unaware that Mavrix had a website so photographs containing a \"Mavrixonline.com\" watermark did not differ from the other photographs with a more generic watermark. To the extent that the district court relied on Delzer's purported lack of knowledge that Mavrix had a website to suggest that Delzer lacked knowledge of the infringements, this was error. The existence of a watermark, and particularly this watermark with a company name, is relevant to the knowledge inquiry.\n\n[15] This inquiry is different from both the threshold determination (i.e., whether the infringing material was posted at the direction of the user, see 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1)), and the knowledge showing (i.e., whether the service provider had knowledge of the infringing material, see 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(1)(A)), where the fact finder should focus on the specific infringements, rather than on the service provider's general practices and procedures.\n\n[16] \"Right and ability to control\" may also be shown by intentional inducement of infringement, but we agree with the district court that inducement is not at issue here.

Judge TRAXLER wrote the opinion, in which Judge WILKINSON and Judge MOTZ joined.\n\nOPINION\n\nTRAXLER, Circuit Judge:\n\nPlaintiffs brought this copyright infringement action against defendant iParadigms, *634 LLC, based on its use of essays and other papers written by plaintiffs for submission to their high school teachers through an online plagiarism detection service operated by iParadigms. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501. iParadigms asserted counterclaims alleging that one of the plaintiffs gained unauthorized access to iParadigms' online service in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1030(a)(5)(A)(iii) & (B)(i), and the Virginia Computer Crimes Act, see Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-152.1-18.2-152.16. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of iParadigms on plaintiffs' copyright infringement claim based on the doctrine of fair use. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. On the counterclaims, the district court granted summary judgment against iParadigms based on its conclusion that iParadigms failed to produce evidence that it suffered any actual or economic damages.\n\nThe parties cross appeal. We affirm the grant of summary judgment on the plaintiffs' copyright infringement claim, but reverse the summary judgment order as to iParadigms' counterclaims and remand for further consideration.\n\nI.\n\nDefendant iParadigms owns and operates \"Turnitin Plagiarism Detection Service,\" an online technology system designed to \"evaluate[ ] the originality of written works in order to prevent plagiarism.\" S.J.A. 1. According to iParadigms, Turnitin offers high school and college educators an automated means of verifying that written works submitted by students are originals and not the products of plagiarism. When a school subscribes to iParadigms' service, it typically requires its students to submit their written assignments \"via a web-based system available at www.turnitin.com or via an integration between Turnitin and a school's course management system.\" S.J.A. 1-2. In order to submit papers online, students \"must be enrolled in an active class\" and must \"enter the class ID number and class enrollment password\" supplied by the assigning professor. J.A. 240.\n\nAfter a student submits a writing assignment, Turnitin performs a digital comparison of the student's work with content available on the Internet, including \"student papers previously submitted to Turnitin, and commercial databases of journal articles and periodicals.\" S.J.A. 2.[1] For each work submitted, Turnitin creates an \"Originality Report\" suggesting a percentage of the work, if any, that appears not to be original. The assigning professor may, based on the results of the Originality Report, further explore any potential issues.\n\nThe Turnitin system gives participating schools the option of \"archiving\" the student works. When this option is selected, Turnitin digitally stores the written works submitted by students \"so that the work becomes part of the database used by Turnitin to evaluate the originality of other student's works in the future.\" S.J.A. 2.[2] The archived student works are stored as digital code, and employees of iParadigms do not read or review the archived works.\n\n*635 To submit a paper to Turnitin, a student must create a user profile on the web site, a process that requires the student to click on \"I Agree\" under the \"terms of agreement\" or \"Clickwrap Agreement.\" The Clickwrap Agreement provided, among other things, that the services offered by Turnitin are \"conditioned on [the user's] acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein,\" and that \"[i]n no event shall iParadigms. . . be liable for any . . . damages arising out of or in any way connected with the use of this web site.\" J.A. 340.\n\nWhen they initiated the lawsuit, the four plaintiffs were minor high school students and thus appeared in this litigation via their next friends. Plaintiffs A.V. and K.W. attended McLean High School in Fairfax County, Virginia, which began using Turnitin in 2006 and opted to have its student papers archived in the Turnitin data base. Plaintiffs E.N. and M.N. attended Desert Vista High School in Tucson, Arizona, which also subscribed to the Turnitin service and elected the archiving option. According to the complaint, both schools required students to submit their written assignments via Turnitin.com to receive credit; failure to do so would result in a grade of \"zero\" for the assignment under the policy of both schools.\n\nPlaintiffs K.W., E.N. and M.N. allege that their teachers adhered to school policy and required them to submit their written assignments to Turnitin. Using the passwords provided by the schools, K.W., E.N. and M.N. submitted their papers, each of which included a \"disclaimer\" objecting to the archiving of their works.[3] As requested by the two high schools, however, each of these submissions was archived. A.V., the fourth plaintiff, did not submit his paper for credit in a high school course; instead, he submitted his work to Turnitin using a password designated for students enrolled in a college course at the University of California, San Diego (\"UCSD\"). The password was provided to A.V. by plaintiffs' counsel who obtained it by conducting an internet search.\n\nAccording to iParadigms, \"no one at iParadigms read[ ] or review[ed] the [p]apers submitted\" by plaintiffs, and iParadigms did not send any \"[p]aper at issue in this action . . . to anybody other than the instructor to whom plaintiffs[ ] submitted their own papers.\" S.J.A. 2.\n\nPlaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that iParadigms infringed their copyright interests in their works by archiving them in the Turnitin database without their permission.[4] The district court granted summary judgment to iParadigms on two bases. First, the court found that the students and iParadigms entered into binding agreements when the students clicked on \"I Agree,\" and that the agreements shielded iParadigms from liability arising out of plaintiffs' use of the Turnitin website. Furthermore, the court concluded that the disclaimers included on plaintiffs' written submissions did not \"modify the Agreement or render it unenforceable.\" *636 J.A. 50.[5]\n\nSecond, the court determined that iParadigms' use of each of the plaintiffs' written submissions qualified as a \"fair use\" under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107 and, therefore, did not constitute infringement. In particular, the court found that the use was transformative because its purpose was to prevent plagiarism by comparative use, and that iParadigms' use of the student works did not impair the market value for high school term papers and other such student works.\n\niParadigms asserted four counterclaims, but only two are now at issue: (1) that plaintiff A.V. gained unauthorized access to Turnitin by using passwords designated for use by college students enrolled at UCSD, in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\"), see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030; and (2) that plaintiff A.V., based on the aforementioned unauthorized access, violated the Virginia Computer Crimes Act (\"VCCA\"), see Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-152.3.\n\nThe district court rejected both counterclaims, granting summary judgment to plaintiff A.V. on the grounds that there was no evidence of actual or economic damages suffered by iParadigms as a result of the alleged violations under the CFAA and the VCCA.\n\nII. Plaintiffs' Appeal\n\nWe first consider the summary judgment order as to plaintiffs' copyright infringement claim. The owner of a copyright enjoys \"a bundle of exclusive rights\" under section 106 of the Copyright Act, Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 546, 105 S. Ct. 2218, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1985), including the right to copy, the right to publish and the right to distribute an author's work, see id. at 547, 105 S. Ct. 2218; see also 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106 (also including among fundamental rights in copyrighted works rights to display, to perform, and to prepare derivative works). These rights \"vest in the author of an original work from the time of its creation.\" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 547, 105 S. Ct. 2218. \"`Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner,' that is, anyone who trespasses into his exclusive domain by using or authorizing the use of the copyrighted work . . . `is an infringer of the copyright.'\" Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 433, 104 S. Ct. 774, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1984) (quoting 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(a)).\n\nThe ownership rights created by the Copyright Act, however, are not absolute; these rights, while exclusive, are \"limited in that a copyright does not secure an exclusive right to the use of facts, ideas, or other knowledge.\" Bond v. Blum, 317 F.3d 385, 394 (4th Cir.2003). Rather, copyright protection extends only to the author's manner of expression. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) (\"In no case does copyright *637 protection for an original work . . . extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described . . .\"); Feist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 344-45, 111 S. Ct. 1282, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1991) (\"The most fundamental axiom of copyright law is that no author may copyright his ideas or the facts he narrates.\" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)).\n\nMoreover, the copyright owner's rights are subject to several exceptions enumerated by the Copyright Act. \"[T]he definition of exclusive rights in \u00a7 106 of the [Copyright] Act is prefaced by the words `subject to sections 107 through [122].' Those sections describe a variety of uses of copyrighted material that `are not infringements of copyright' `notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 106.'\" Sony, 464 U.S. at 447, 104 S. Ct. 774 (quoting 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106).\n\nOne of these statutory exceptions codifies the common-law \"fair use\" doctrine, which \"allows the public to use not only facts and ideas contained in a copyrighted work, but also expression itself in certain circumstances.\" Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186, 219, 123 S. Ct. 769, 154 L. Ed. 2d 683 (2003); see Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 577, 114 S. Ct. 1164, 127 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1994) (\"Congress meant \u00a7 107 to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use . . . and intended that courts continue the common-law tradition of fair use adjudication.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). \"From the infancy of copyright protection, some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials has been thought necessary to fulfill copyright's very purpose, `[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts. . . .'\" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 575, 114 S. Ct. 1164 (quoting U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8). Courts have traditionally regarded \"fair use\" of a copyrighted work as \"a privilege in others than the owner of the copyright to use the copyrighted material in a reasonable manner without his consent.\" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 549, 105 S. Ct. 2218 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThus, the copyright owner's \"monopoly. . . is limited and subject to a list of statutory exceptions, including the exception for fair use provided in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107.\" Bond, 317 F.3d at 393 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A person who makes fair use of a copyrighted work is not an infringer even if such use is otherwise inconsistent with the exclusive rights of the copyright owner. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107 (providing that \"the fair use of a copyrighted work . . . is not an infringement of copyright\"); cf. Bond, 317 F.3d at 394 (\"A fair-use analysis bears relevance only when a challenged use violates a right protected by the Copyright Act.\").\n\nSection 107 provides that \"the fair use of a copyrighted work . . . for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. Congress provided four nonexclusive factors for courts to consider in making a \"fair use\" determination:\n\n(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n*638 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. Section 107 contemplates that the question of whether a given use of copyrighted material is \"fair\" requires a case-by-case analysis in which the statutory factors are not \"treated in isolation\" but are \"weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright.\" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578,  114 S. Ct. 1164.\n\nWith these general principles in mind, we consider each of the statutory factors.\n\nFirst Factor\n\nThe first fair use factor requires us to consider \"the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(1). A use of the copyrighted material that has a commercial purpose \"tends to weigh against a finding of fair use.\" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562, 105 S. Ct. 2218. \"The crux of the profit/nonprofit distinction is not whether the sole motive of the use is monetary gain but whether the user stands to profit from exploitation of the copyrighted material without paying the customary price.\" Id.\n\nIn assessing the \"character\" of the use, we should consider the specific examples set forth in section 107's preamble, \"looking to whether the use is for criticism, or comment, or news reporting, and the like,\" with the goal of determining whether the use at issue \"merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or instead adds something new, with a further purpose or different character.\" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578-79, 114 S. Ct. 1164 (internal quotation marks, alteration and citation omitted). Courts, therefore, must examine \"whether and to what extent the new work is transformative. . . . [T]he more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.\" Id. at 579,  114 S. Ct. 1164 (internal quotation marks omitted). A \"transformative\" use is one that \"employ[s] the quoted matter in a different manner or for a different purpose from the original,\" thus transforming it. Pierre N. Leval, Commentary, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L.Rev. 1105, 1111 (1990).\n\nIn considering the character and purpose of iParadigms' use of the student works, the district court focused on the question of whether the use was transformative in nature. The court concluded that \"iParadigms, through Turnitin, uses the papers for an entirely different purpose, namely, to prevent plagiarism and protect the students' written works from plagiarism . . . by archiving the students' works as digital code.\" J.A. 54. Although the district court recognized that iParadigms intends to profit from its use of the student works, the court found that iParadigms' use of plaintiffs' works was \"highly transformative,\" J.A. 54, and \"provides a substantial public benefit through the network of educational institutions using Turnitin.\" J.A. 55. Accordingly, the court concluded that the first factor weighed in favor of a finding of fair use.\n\nPlaintiffs argue the district court's analysis contained several flaws. First, they suggest that the district court ignored the commercial nature of iParadigms' use of their materials, highlighting the fact that iParadigms is a for-profit company that enjoys millions of revenue dollars based on its ever-increasing database of student works. Seizing upon the Supreme Court's suggestion in Sony that \"every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively an unfair exploitation of the monopoly privilege that belong to the owner of the copyright,\" 464 U.S. at 451, 104 S. Ct. 774, plaintiffs contend that the archiving of their papers cannot constitute a fair use under section 107.\n\n*639 The district court, however, did not ignore the fact that iParadigms' use of the plaintiffs' works occurred in the commercial context; indeed, the court expressly noted that \"iParadigms makes a profit in providing this service to educational institutions.\" J.A. 55. But the fact that the disputed use of copyrighted material is commercial is not determinative in and of itself. See Sony, 464 U.S. at 448, 104 S. Ct. 774. As the Second Circuit observed, \"[s]ince many, if not most, secondary users seek at least some measure of commercial gain from their use, unduly emphasizing the commercial motivation of a copier will lead to an overly restrictive view of fair use.\" American Geophysical Union v. Texaco, Inc., 60 F.3d 913, 921 (2d Cir.1994); see Campbell, 510 U.S. at 584,  114 S. Ct. 1164 (observing that \"[i]f. . . commerciality carried presumptive force against a finding of fairness, the presumption would swallow nearly all of the illustrative uses listed in the preamble paragraph of \u00a7 107,\" which \"are generally conducted for profit in this country\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Court has made clear that Sony did not establish a per se rule that a commercial use barred a fair use finding. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 585,  114 S. Ct. 1164 (\"The Court of Appeals' elevation of one sentence from Sony to a per se rule . . . runs as much counter to Sony itself as to the long common-law tradition of fair use adjudication.\"). Thus, although a commercial use finding generally weighs against a finding of fair use, it must \"be weighed along with [the] other factors in fair use decisions.\" Sony, 464 U.S. at 449 n. 32, 104 S. Ct. 774.\n\nIn this case, the district court determined that the commercial aspect was not significant in light of the transformative nature of iParadigms' use. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578-79, 114 S. Ct. 1164. The district court simply weighed the commercial nature of iParadigms' use along with other fair use factors, as is appropriate under Supreme Court precedent. See id. at 579, 114 S. Ct. 1164 (explaining that \"the more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use\").\n\nPlaintiffs also argue that iParadigms' use of their works cannot be transformative because the archiving process does not add anything to the work \u0097 Turnitin merely stores the work unaltered and in its entirety. This argument is clearly misguided. The use of a copyrighted work need not alter or augment the work to be transformative in nature. Rather, it can be transformative in function or purpose without altering or actually adding to the original work. See, e.g., Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 508 F.3d 1146, 1165 (9th Cir.2007) (concluding that Google's use of copyrighted images in thumbnail search index was \"highly transformative\" even though the images themselves were not altered, in that the use served a different function than the images served). iParadigms' use of plaintiffs' works had an entirely different function and purpose than the original works; the fact that there was no substantive alteration to the works does not preclude the use from being transformative in nature.\n\nPlaintiffs further contend that, even if iParadigms' use of their works has a transformative purpose, the use itself is not transformative if it fails to effect such purpose. Plaintiffs assert that there is at least a question of fact as to whether Turnitin effectively prevents plagiarism such that summary judgment is inappropriate. In support of this contention, plaintiffs offered evidence showing that it is possible to defeat the Turnitin system by paraphrasing the original copyrighted work *640 and that the system sometimes does not catch even verbatim copying. In other words, because the Turnitin system is not fool-proof, the archiving of plaintiffs' works to compare and detect plagiarism cannot be transformative.\n\nWe reject this assertion as well. The question of whether a use is transformative does not rise or fall on whether the use perfectly achieves its intended purpose. Cf. Campbell, 510 U.S. at 582, 114 S. Ct. 1164 (declining to evaluate the quality of the parody and declaring that \"when fair use is raised in defense of parody, [the threshold question] is whether a parodic character may reasonably be perceived\"). Plaintiffs do not dispute that the Turnitin system does detect some level of plagiarism, even if, as they assert in the complaint, \"[t]he Turnitin system is capable of detecting only the most ignorant or lazy attempts at plagiarism by students without significant monetary resources.\" J.A. 21. Whether a better plagiarism detection system could be designed is not important to our analysis of whether the disputed use serves a different purpose or function.\n\nThe district court, in our view, correctly determined that the archiving of plaintiffs' papers was transformative and favored a finding of \"fair use.\" iParadigms' use of these works was completely unrelated to expressive content and was instead aimed at detecting and discouraging plagiarism.\n\nSecond Factor\n\nIn considering the nature of the copyrighted work, the Supreme Court has instructed that \"fair use is more likely to be found in factual works than in fictional works,\" whereas \"a use is less likely to be deemed fair when the copyrighted work is a creative product.\" Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207, 237,  110 S. Ct. 1750, 109 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1990) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This postulate recognizes the notion that a work is entitled to greater copyright protection as it comes closer to \"the core of creative expression.\" Bond, 317 F.3d at 395. However, if the disputed use of the copyrighted work \"is not related to its mode of expression but rather to its historical facts,\" then the creative nature of the work is mitigated. Id. at 396. And, in fact, the district court concluded that iParadigms' use of the plaintiffs' works \"relate[d] solely to the comparative value of the works\" and did not \"diminish[ ] the incentive for creativity on the part of students.\" J.A. 55. The district court noted that, if anything, iParadigms' use of the students' works fostered the development of original and creative works \"by detecting any efforts at plagiarism by other students.\" J.A. 55.\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the district court's application of this factor was flawed in two respects. First, they argue that the court failed to account for the fact that their works were unpublished. Because an author enjoys the \"right to control the first public appearance of his undisseminated expression,\" the fair use of an unpublished work is narrower in scope. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 555, 105 S. Ct. 2218; see id. at 564, 105 S. Ct. 2218 (\"[T]he author's right to control the first public appearance of his expression weighs against such use of the work before its release.\"). In its order, the district court omits mention of this fact; therefore, plaintiffs suggest that the district court's entire analysis of the second statutory factor is invalid.\n\nWe disagree that the lack of an express reference to the unpublished status of plaintiffs' works undermines the court's analysis under \u00a7 107(2). Not only has the Supreme Court admonished courts to resist weighing the fair use factors in isolation, see Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578, 114 S. Ct. 1164, but Congress specifically provided that \"[t]he fact that a work is unpublished *641 shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. Therefore, in Bond, we were able to conclude that the introduction into a court proceeding of an original work of fiction constituted fair use under \u00a7 107 despite the fact that the copyrighted work was unpublished:\n\nThat Bond's manuscript is unpublished and contains a stylized mode of expressing his feelings about historical facts weigh against a finding of fair use. But, as Campbell instructs, we do not consider the \u00a7 107 factors in isolation from one another, but we weigh them together in light of the purposes of copyright. Where, as here, the use of the work is not related to its mode of expression but rather to its historical facts and there is no evidence that the use of Bond's manuscript in the state legal proceedings would adversely affect the potential market for the manuscript, one cannot say the incentive for creativity has been diminished in any sense.\nId. at 395-96 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Here, the district court, quoting Bond, concluded that iParadigms' use was unconnected to any creative element in plaintiffs' works. Given that the district court drew its language verbatim from a passage in Bond discussing the fair use of unpublished works of fiction, the district court clearly did not ignore the unpublished nature of these works.\n\nMoreover, it is clear that iParadigms' use of plaintiffs' works did not have the \"intended purpose\" or \"incidental effect\" of supplanting plaintiffs' rights to first publication. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 562, 105 S. Ct. 2218. This is significant in that the primary basis for the close scrutiny courts give the use of an unpublished work is, as previously noted, an \"author's right to control the first public appearance of his expression.\" Id. at 564, 105 S. Ct. 2218. iParadigms did not publicly disseminate or display plain-tiffs' works and did not send them to any third party \"other than the instructor to whom plaintiffs submitted their own papers.\" S.A. 2. In fact, the Turnitin digital archiving process does not involve any review of the submitted works at all, even by those at iParadigms. Thus, no employee of iParadigms read or reviewed the works submitted by plaintiffs. We find no basis whatsoever for concluding that iParadigms' use of the plaintiffs' papers undermined their right to first publication.\n\nPlaintiffs contend that the district court's consideration of the \"nature of the copyrighted works\" factor was flawed for a second reason: the district court ignored the fact that the works in question were works of fiction and poetry, which are considered \"highly creative\" in nature and deserving of the strongest protection. This argument is unpersuasive as well in that the district court expressly acknowledged its obligation to consider whether the works in question came within the \"core of creative expression.\" J.A. 55. Rather than ignore it, how-ever, the district court simply concluded that even if the plaintiffs' works were highly creative in nature, iParadigms' use of the plaintiffs' works was not related to the creative core of the works. In concluding that the second factor favored neither plaintiffs nor iParadigms, the district court was merely applying Bond in which we concluded that the use of an unpublished work of fiction in a court proceeding constituted fair use because such use was \"not related to its mode of expression but rather to its historical facts.\" 317 F.3d at 396. iParadigms' use of the works in the case\u0097as part of a digitized database from which to compare the similarity of typewritten characters *642 used in other student works\u0097is likewise unrelated to any creative component. Thus, we find no fault in the district court's application of the second fair use factor.\n\nThird Factor\n\nThe third fair use factor requires us to consider \"the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(3). Generally speaking, \"as the amount of the copyrighted material that is used increases, the likelihood that the use will constitute a `fair use' decreases.\" Bond, 317 F.3d at 396. But this statutory factor also requires courts to consider, in addition to quantity, the \"quality and importance\" of the copyrighted materials used, Campbell, 510 U.S. at 587, 114 S. Ct. 1164, that is, whether the portion of the copyrighted material was \"the heart of the copyrighted work.\" Sundeman v. The Seajay Soc'y, Inc., 142 F.3d 194, 205 (4th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although \"[c]opying an entire work weighs against finding a fair use, . . . it does not preclude a finding of fair use\"; therefore, \"[t]he extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the use.\" Id. at 205-06 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).\n\nThe district court found that this factor, like the second factor, did not favor either party. The court concluded that although iParadigms uses substantially the whole of plaintiffs' works, iParadigms' \"use of the original works is limited in purpose and scope\" as a digitized record for electronic \"comparison purposes only.\" J.A. 56. Having already concluded that such use of plaintiffs' works was transformative, the district court concluded that iParadigms' use of the entirety of plaintiffs' works did not preclude a finding of fair use.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by referring to the transformative nature of iParadigms' use in its analysis of the amount and substantiality of the portion of the copyrighted work used under \u00a7 107(3). In our view, the district court did not analytically merge the first and third fair use factors by referring to iParadigms' transformative use of the students' works. Plaintiffs' argument, in fact, fails to recognize the overlap that exists between the fair use factors. The first and third factors, for example, take into account to some degree the purpose of the disputed use. Compare 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(1); and Sundeman, 142 F.3d at 202 (explaining that \"[t]he `further purpose' and `different character' of [the defendant's use] make it transformative\" under \u00a7 107(1)), with Bond, 317 F.3d at 396 (concluding that \u00a7 107(3) did not favor plaintiffs because the defendant's \"sole purpose and intent\" was not to use the expressive content in the plaintiffs' works but \"to obtain admissions of fact\" in a court proceeding). We find no error in the district court's analysis.\n\nFourth Factor\n\nFinally, \u00a7 107 directs us to examine the market of the copyrighted work to determine \"the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107(4). The Supreme Court described this factor as the \"single most important element of fair use,\" Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at 566, 105 S. Ct. 2218, considering that a primary goal of copyright is to ensure that \"authors [have] the opportunity to realize rewards in order to encourage them to create.\" Leval, Toward a Fair Use Standard, 103 Harv. L.Rev. at 1124. By contrast, \"a use that has no demonstrable effect upon the potential market for, or the value of, the copyrighted work need not be prohibited in order to protect the author's incentive *643 to create.\" Sony, 464 U.S. at 450,  104 S. Ct. 774.\n\nOur task is to determine whether the defendants' use of plaintiffs' works \"would materially impair the marketability of the work[s] and whether it would act as a market substitute\" for them. Bond, 317 F.3d at 396. We focus here not upon \"whether the secondary use suppresses or even destroys the market for the original work or its potential derivatives, but [upon] whether the secondary use usurps the market of the original work.\" NXIVM Corp. v. The Ross Institute, 364 F.3d 471, 482 (2nd Cir.2004) (emphasis added). An adverse market effect, in and of itself, does not preclude application of the fair use defense. \"The fair use doctrine protects against a republication which offers the copyrighted work in a secondary packaging, where potential customers, having read the secondary work, will no longer be inclined to purchase again something they have already read.\" Sundeman, 142 F.3d at 207 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe analysis of whether the disputed use offers a market substitute for the original work overlaps to some extent with the question of whether the use was transformative. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 591, 114 S. Ct. 1164 (distinguishing a secondary use that simply duplicates an original work in its entirety, thereby superseding it, from a secondary use that is transformative). To the extent this issue arises in fair use cases, it often does so when the secondary use at issue involves a scholarly critique or parody of the original work. See Campbell, 510 U.S. at 592, 114 S. Ct. 1164 (\"[T]he role of the courts is to distinguish between biting criticism that merely suppresses demand and copyright infringement, which usurps it.\" (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); see also Sundeman, 142 F.3d at 207 (holding that defendant's critique of a novel \"did not have the purpose or effect of supplanting the copyrighted work\" and that its use of the novel was transformative and thus did not create a market substitute for the original work); Davis v. The Gap, Inc., 246 F.3d 152, 175 (2d Cir.2001) (explaining that \"[i]f the harm resulted from a transformative secondary use that lowered the public's estimation of the original (such as a devastating review of a book that quotes liberally from the original to show how silly and poorly written it is), this transformative use will be found to be a fair use, not withstanding the harm\").\n\nBut regardless of whether the defendant used the original work to critique or parody it, the transformative nature of the use is relevant to the market effect factor. See Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co., 268 F.3d 1257, 1274 n. 28 (11th Cir.2001) (\"Whereas a work that merely supplants or supersedes another is likely to cause a substantially adverse impact on the potential market of the original, a transformative work is less likely to do so.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Davis, 246 F.3d at 176 (noting that \"the market effect must be evaluated in light of whether the secondary use is transformative\").\n\nThe district court concluded that iParadigms' Turnitin system did not serve as a market substitute or even harm the market value of the works, highlighting the deposition testimony of the plaintiffs \u0097 each of whom denied that iParadigms' \"impinged on the marketability of their works or interfered with their use of the works.\" J.A. 58. The district court also noted that, although the pleadings alleged iParadigms' use would adversely impact plaintiffs' ability to market their works to other high school students seeking to purchase completed term papers or essays, each plaintiff indicated that such transactions were dishonest *644 and that he or she would not sell their original works for submission by other students.\n\nFurthermore, the court rejected plaintiffs' contention that iParadigms' use would adversely impact the value of the works if a recipient such as a college admissions department or a literary journal used the Turnitin system to verify originality. Because their works are now archived, plaintiffs argued, the Turnitin system would report that their own original works were plagiarized. In light of how the Turnitin system works, the district court rejected the argument as speculative at best:\n\nAnyone who is reasonably familiar with Turnitin's operation will be able to recognize that the identical match is not the result of plagiarism, but simply the result of Plaintiff's earlier submission. Individuals familiar with Turnitin, such as those in the field of education, would be expecting the works submitted to have been previously submitted.\nJ.A. 59.\n\nOn appeal, plaintiffs' primary contention is that the district court focused on whether there was evidence of actual damages, failing to consider the effect of iParadigms' use on the \"potential market\" for plaintiffs' works.[6] Clearly, this assertion is incorrect. The district court considered the potential market effects suggested by plaintiffs but concluded that plaintiffs' arguments were theoretical and speculative. Plaintiffs' most plausible theory was that iParadigms' archiving of their papers impaired the sale of the papers to high school students in the market for unpublished term papers, essays and the like. Undoubtedly, there is a market for students who wish to purchase such works and submit them as their own for academic credit.[7] And, iParadigms' archiving of such papers on the Turnitin website might well impair the marketability of such works to student buyers intending to submit works they did not author without being identified as plagiarists.\n\nAs noted by the district court, however, the plaintiffs testified that they would not sell the works at issue here to any dealer in such a market because such a transaction would make them party to cheating and would encourage plagiarism. Furthermore, to the extent that iParadigms' use would adversely affect plaintiffs' works in this particular market, we must consider the transformative nature of the use. Clearly no market substitute was created by iParadigms, whose archived student works do not supplant the plaintiffs' works in the \"paper mill\" market so much as merely suppress demand for them, by keeping record of the fact that such works had been previously submitted. Cf. Davis, 246 F.3d at 175 (noting that fair use occurs where \"the harm resulted from a transformative secondary use that lowered the public's estimation of the original\" rather than from a market substitute). In our view, then, any harm here is not of the kind protected against by copyright law.\n\nThe plaintiffs offer a few additional theories under which iParadigms' use of their papers could conceivably affect marketability. For example, plaintiffs point to the possibility that if they submitted all or a portion of their own works to a periodical *645 for publishing or to a college admissions board, and the magazine or college used Turnitin, then their submitted works might potentially be discredited as a product of plagiarism. Like the district court, we conclude that these theories are implausible in light of how the Turnitin system generally operates. We find nothing in the record to suggest that any of these scenarios envisioned by plaintiffs are anything more than unfounded speculation.\n\nIn sum, we conclude, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, that iParadigms' use of the student works was \"fair use\" under the Copyright Act and that iParadigms was therefore entitled to summary judgment on the copyright infringement claim.[8]\n\nIII. iParadigms' Cross Appeal\n\nA.\n\niParadigms asserted a counterclaim against plaintiff A.V. under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\"), see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030, a statute generally intended to deter computer hackers.[9] Although the CFAA is primarily a criminal statute, it permits private parties to bring a cause of action to redress a violation of the CFAA: \"Any person who suffers damage or loss by reason of a violation of this section may maintain a civil action . . . to obtain compensatory damages and injunctive relief or other equitable relief.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(g). iParadigms alleged that by gaining unauthorized access to Turnitin through a password assigned to UCSD students, plaintiff A.V. violated \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(A)(iii), which prohibited any person from \"intentionally access[ing] a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, caus[ing] damage,\" and, by such conduct, caused, in violation of \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(B)(i), \"loss to 1 or more persons during any 1-year period. . . aggregating at least $5,000 in value.\" Additionally, the CFAA imposed this limit: \"Damages for a violation involving only. . . [\u00a7 1030(a)(5)(B)(i)] are limited to economic damages.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(g) (emphasis added).[10]\n\niParadigms offered evidence that when it learned that A.V. was able to register and submit papers as a student of a university in which he was not enrolled and had never attended, it feared the possibility of a technical glitch in the Turnitin system and concluded an investigation was necessary. Unaware that A.V. had simply obtained a password posted on the Internet, iParadigms assigned several employees to determine what happened. According to iParadigms, over the course of about one week, numerous man-hours were spent responding to A.V.'s use of the UCSD password.\n\nThe district court concluded that iParadigms' counterclaim failed as a matter of *646 law because \u00a7 1030(g) limited damages for a violation of \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(B)(i) to \"economic damages.\" The court found that iParadigms \"failed to produce any evidence of actual or economic damages,\" J.A. 64, and \"only presented evidence of consequential damages resulting from the steps taken by iParadigms in response to A.V.'s submissions.\" J.A. 63. Implicit in the district court's conclusion was the assumption that \"economic damages\" in \u00a7 1030(g) does not encompass any \"consequential damages\" whatsoever.\n\niParadigms counters that \"economic damages\" ought to be accorded its ordinary meaning, which would include consequential damages but exclude recovery for pain and suffering or emotional distress. See Creative Computing v. Getloaded.com LLC, 386 F.3d 930, 935 (9th Cir.2004) (concluding that the \"economic damages\" limitation \"precludes damages for death, personal injury, mental distress, and the like\" but includes \"loss of business and business goodwill\"). We agree that the district court construed the \"economic damages\" provision too narrowly. To maintain a civil action under the CFAA, a person first must have \"suffer[ed] damage or loss by reason of a violation of this section.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(g). The CFAA defines \"loss\" as \"any reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring . . . the system . . . to its condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages incurred because of interruption of service.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(e)(11) (emphasis added). This broadly worded provision plainly contemplates consequential damages of the type sought by iParadigms \u0097 costs incurred as part of the response to a CFAA violation, including the investigation of an offense. See, e.g., Modis, Inc. v. Bardelli, 531 F. Supp. 2d 314, 320 (D.Conn.2008) (noting that \"the costs of responding to the offense are recoverable\" including \"costs to investigate and take remedial steps\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); SuccessFactors, Inc. v. Softscape, Inc., 544 F. Supp. 2d 975, 980-81 (N.D.Cal.2008) (holding that the cost of investigating and identifying the CFAA offense, including \"many hours of valuable time away from day-to-day responsibilities, causing losses well in excess of $5,000,\" qualified as \"cost[s] of responding to an offense\" under \u00a7 1030(e)(11)).\n\nAccordingly, we remand for further consideration of this claim, expressing no opinion as to whether the evidence is otherwise sufficient to establish a viable CFAA claim or whether the alleged consequential damages were reasonable, sufficiently proven, or directly causally linked to A.V.'s alleged CFFA violation.\n\nB.\n\niParadigms asserted another counterclaim against plaintiff A.V. under the Virginia Computer Crimes Act (\"VCCA\"), which provides that \"[a]ny person who uses a computer or computer network, without authority and . . . [o]btains property or services by false pretenses. . . is guilty of the crime of computer fraud.\" Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-152.3. Moreover, \"[a]ny person who willfully obtains computer services without authority is guilty of the crime of theft of computer services.\" Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-152.6. Section 18.2-152.12 provides that \"any person whose property or person is injured by reason of a violation of [the VCCA] . . . may sue therefor and recover for any damages sustained and the costs of suit.\" The factual basis for this counterclaim was essentially the same as that for the CFAA counterclaim \u0097 that A.V., a Virginia resident, obtained access to the Turnitin service by using passwords and enrollment *647 codes that A.V. did not have authorization to use. The district court granted summary judgment to A.V. on iParadigms' VCCA claim, as it had on the CFAA claim, based on its conclusion that iParadigms failed to present evidence of actual or economic damages caused by A.V.'s submission of papers as a UCSD student.\n\niParadigms contends that because the district court rejected the CFAA and the VCCA counterclaims for the same reasons, the district court was necessarily construing the phrase \"any damages\" under the VCCA to exclude consequential damages. iParadigms suggests that there is no indication in the statute that the Virginia General Assembly intended to so limit the meaning of \"any damages.\" Finding nothing in the statute to suggest that consequential damages are not available under section 18.2-152.12, we agree that it was error to dismiss the VCCA claim solely on this basis. Moreover, we decline A.V.'s invitation to affirm on other grounds, such as the lack of evidence to establish a causal link between the submission of A.V.'s paper and any damages, consequential or otherwise.\n\nWe conclude that the evidence of consequential damages presented by iParadigms came within the \"any damages\" language of the VCCA, and therefore that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment because there was no evidence of \"actual or economic damages.\" We express no opinion, however, as to whether iParadigms is a \"person whose property or person is injured by reason of a violation of [the VCCA],\" Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-152.12, or whether this claim is otherwise viable.\n\nIV.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the order of the district court granting summary judgment to iParadigms as to plaintiffs' copyright infringement claim. As to iParadigms' counterclaims, however, we reverse the grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs and remand for further consideration.\n\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] The comparison occurs as follows: \"[T]he Turnitin system makes a `fingerprint' of the work by applying mathematical algorithms to its content. This fingerprint is merely a digital code. Using the digital fingerprint made of the student's work, the Turnitin system compares the student's work electronically to content available on the Internet . . . and student papers previously submitted to Turnitin.\" S.J.A. 2.\n\n[2] At the time plaintiffs filed this action, there were approximately 7,000 institutional Turnitin subscribers that, in turn, resulted in the submission of about 125,000 papers each day.\n\n[3] Shortly before plaintiffs submitted their assignments to Turnitin, plaintiffs' counsel applied for and was granted a copyright registration for each paper at issue.\n\n[4] Plaintiffs also alleged that the Turnitin system offends copyright law because it \"may send a full and complete copy of a student's unpublished manuscript to an iParadigms client anywhere in the world upon request of the client, and without the student's permission.\" J.A. 22. Plaintiffs, however, have not produced any evidence to demonstrate that this occurred with respect to the plaintiffs' works at issue here. Accordingly, we confine our review of the copyright issues to iParadigms' practice of archiving documents.\n\n[5] Plaintiffs offered two other theories upon which the district court could find the Clickwrap Agreement unenforceable, which the court also rejected. First, the district court disagreed that the agreement was an unenforceable adhesion contract, finding no evidence that plaintiffs were coerced by iParadigms (as opposed to the schools). Second, the district court refused to void the contract based on the doctrine of infancy, see Zelnick v. Adams, 263 Va. 601,  561 S.E.2d 711, 715 (2002) (\"[A] contract with an infant is not void, only voidable by the infant upon attaining the age of majority.\"), concluding that plaintiffs cannot use this doctrine as a \"sword\" to void a contract while retaining the benefits of the contract \u0097 high school credit and standing to bring this action, cf. 5 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a7 9.14 (4th ed.) (\"When the infant has received consideration which he still possesses,. . . he cannot, upon reaching majority, keep it and refuse to pay.\")\n\n[6] Plaintiffs note emphatically that the fourth statutory fair use factor \"specifically uses the word `potential' . . . and nowhere uses the word `damage.'\" Brief of Appellants at 29. This point of emphasis is somewhat ironic in that the district court did not use the word \"damage\" either, but did discuss potential market effect.\n\n[7] Web sites such as www.ibuytermpapers.com, for example, offer completed papers and essays purchased from high school students.\n\n[8] In light of our \"fair use\" analysis, we decline to address the question of whether the terms of the Clickwrap Agreement created an enforceable contract between plaintiffs and iParadigms.\n\n[9] See, e.g., Charlotte Decker, Note, Cyber Crime 2.0: An Argument to Update the United States Criminal Code to Reflect the Changing Nature of Cyber Crime, 81 S. Cal. L.Rev. 959, 980-81 (2008) (\"The CFAA, \u00a7 1030(a)(5), is the primary tool used to investigate and prosecute hacking crimes.\").\n\n[10] The CFAA was amended after the district court issued its decision in this case.

Inc., eBay, Inc., and Twitter, Inc.\n\nOrder; Opinion by Judge SILVERMAN; Dissent by Judge EA\n\nORDER\n\nJudges Silverman and Quist have voted to grant panel rehearing. Judge Bea has voted to deny rehearing. The petition for rehearing en banc is now moot. The Opinion filed July 6, 2015, and appearing at 792 F.3d 1070 (9th Cir.2015), is withdrawn. The Superseding Opinion and Dissent are filed contemporaneously with this order. The parties may file additional petitions for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc.\n\nOPINION\n\nSILVERMAN, Circuit Judge:\n\nIn the present appeal, we must decide whether the following scenario constitutes trademark infringement: A customer goes online to Amazon.com looking for a certain military-style wristwatch\u2014specifically the \"MTM Special Ops\"\u2014marketed and manufactured by Plaintiff Multi Time Machine, Inc. The customer types \"mtm special ops\" in the search box and presses \"enter.\" Because Amazon does not sell the MTM Special Ops watch, what the search produces is a list, with photographs, of several other brands of military style watches that Amazon does carry, specifically identified by their brand names\u2014Luminox, Chase-Durer, TAWATEC, and Modus.\n\nMTM brought suit alleging that Amazon's response to a search for the MTM Special Ops watch on its website is trademark infringement in violation of the Lanham\n[804 F.3d 933]\nAct. MTM contends that Amazon's search results page creates a likelihood of confusion, even though there is no evidence of any actual confusion and even though the other brands are clearly identified by name. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Amazon, and MTM now appeals.\n\nWe affirm. \"The core element of trademark infringement\" is whether the defendant's conduct \"is likely to confuse customers about the source of the products.\" E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Gallo Cattle Co., 967 F.2d 1280, 1290 (9th Cir. 1992). Because Amazon's search results page clearly labels the name and manufacturer of each product offered for sale and even includes photographs of the items, no reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online would likely be confused as to the source of the products. Thus, summary judgment of MTM's trademark claims was proper.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\n\nMTM manufactures and markets watches under various brand names including MTM, MTM Special Ops, and MTM Military Ops. MTM holds the federally registered trademark \"MTM Special Ops\" for timepieces. MTM sells its watches directly to its customers and through various retailers. To cultivate and maintain an image as a high-end, exclusive brand, MTM does not sell its watches through Amazon.com. Further, MTM does not authorize its distributors, whose agreements require them to seek MTM's permission to sell MTM's products anywhere but their own retail sites, to sell MTM watches on Amazon.com. Therefore, MTM watches have never been available for sale on Amazon.com.\n\nAmazon is an online retailer that purports to offer \"Earth's Biggest Selection of products.\" Amazon has designed its website to enable millions of unique products to be sold by both Amazon and third party sellers across dozens of product categories.\n\nConsumers who wish to shop for products on Amazon's website can utilize Amazon's search function. The search function enables consumers to navigate Amazon.com's large marketplace by providing consumers with relevant results in response to the consumer's query. In order to provide search results in which the consumer is most likely to be interested, Amazon's search function does not simply match the words in the user's query to words in a document, such as a product description in Amazon.com's catalog. Rather, Amazon's search function\u2014like general purpose web search engines such as Google or Bing\u2014employs a variety of techniques, including some that rely on user behavior, to produce relevant results. By going beyond exactly matching a user's query to text describing a product, Amazon's search function can provide consumers with relevant results that would otherwise be overlooked.\n\nConsumers who go onto Amazon.com and search for the term \"mtm special ops\" are directed to a search results page. On the search results page, the search query used\u2014here, \"mtm special ops\"\u2014is displayed twice: in the search query box and directly below the search query box in what is termed a \"breadcrumb.\" The breadcrumb displays the original query, \"mtm special ops,\" in quotation marks to provide a trail for the consumer to follow back to the original search. Directly below the breadcrumb, is a \"Related Searches\" field, which provides the consumer with alternative search queries in case the consumer is dissatisfied with the results of the original search. Here, the Related Search that is suggested to the consumer is: \"mtm special ops watch.\" Directly below the \"Related Searches\" field is a gray bar containing\n[804 F.3d 934]\nthe text \"Showing 10 Results.\" Then, directly below the gray bar is Amazon's product listings. The gray bar separates the product listings from the breadcrumb and the \"Related Searches\" field. The particular search results page at issue is displayed below:\n\n\n\nMTM watches are not listed on the page for the simple reason that neither Amazon nor MTM sells MTM watches on Amazon.\n\nMTM filed a complaint against Amazon, alleging that Amazon's search results page infringes MTM's trademarks in violation of the Lanham Act. Amazon filed a\n[804 F.3d 935]\nmotion for summary judgment, arguing that (1) it is not using MTM's mark in commerce and (2) there is no likelihood of consumer confusion. In ruling on Amazon's motion for summary judgment, the district court declined to resolve the issue of whether Amazon is using MTM's mark in commerce, and, instead, addressed the issue of likelihood of confusion. In evaluating likelihood of confusion, the district court utilized the eight-factor test set forth in AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341 (9th Cir.1979).1 Relying on our recent decision in Network Automation, Inc. v. Advanced Systems Concepts, 638 F.3d 1137 (9th Cir.2011), the district court focused in particular on the following factors: (1) the strength of MTM's mark; (2) the evidence of actual confusion and the evidence of no confusion; (3) the type of goods and degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser; and (4) the appearance of the product listings and the surrounding context on the screen displaying the results page. Upon reviewing the factors, the district court concluded that the relevant Sleekcraft factors established \"that there is no likelihood of confusion in Amazon's use of MTM's trademarks in its search engine or display of search results.\" Therefore, the district court granted Amazon's motion for summary judgment.\n\nII. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\n\"The decision to grant summary judgment in a trademark infringement claim is reviewed de novo, and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party.\" Surfvivor Media, Inc. v. Survivor Prods., 406 F.3d 625, 630 (9th Cir.2005). \"Although disfavored in trademark infringement cases, summary judgment may be entered when no genuine issue of material fact exists.\" Id. Indeed, in several trademark cases, we have concluded that there is no likelihood of confusion as a matter of law and affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant. See, e.g., One Indus., LLC v. Jim O'Neal Distrib., 578 F.3d 1154, 1162-65 (9th Cir.2009); M2 Software, Inc. v. Madacy Entm't, 421 F.3d 1073, 1080-85 (9th Cir.2005); Surfvivor Media, 406 F.3d at 631-34.\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nTo prevail on a claim of trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, \"a trademark holder must show that the defendant's use of its trademark `is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.'\" Fortune Dynamic, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores Brand Mgmt., 618 F.3d 1025, 1030 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1)-(a)(1)(A)). \"The test for likelihood of confusion is whether a `reasonably prudent consumer' in the marketplace is likely to be confused as to the origin of the good or service bearing one of the marks.\" Dreamwerks Prod. Group v. SKG Studio, 142 F.3d 1127, 1129 (9th Cir. 1998). \"The confusion must `be probable, not simply a possibility.'\" Murray v. Cable NBC, 86 F.3d 858, 861 (9th Cir.1996).\n\nHere, the district court was correct in ruling that there is no likelihood of confusion. Amazon is responding to a customer's inquiry about a brand it does not carry by doing no more than stating clearly\n[804 F.3d 936]\n(and showing pictures of) what brands it does carry. To whatever extent the Sleekcraft factors apply in a case such as this\u2014a merchant responding to a request for a particular brand it does not sell by offering other brands clearly identified as such\u2014the undisputed evidence shows that confusion on the part of the inquiring buyer is not at all likely. Not only are the other brands clearly labeled and accompanied by photographs, there is no evidence of actual confusion by anyone.\n\nTo analyze likelihood of confusion, we utilize the eight-factor test set forth in Sleekcraft. However, \"[w]e have long cautioned that applying the Sleekcraft test is not like counting beans.\" One Indus., 578 F.3d at 1162; see also Network Automation, Inc. v. Advanced Sys. Concepts, 638 F.3d 1137, 1145 (9th Cir.2011) (\"The Sleekcraft factors are intended as an adaptable proxy for consumer confusion, not a rote checklist.\"). \"Some factors are much more important than others, and the relative importance of each individual factor will be case-specific.\" Brookfield Commc'ns v. West Coast Entm't Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1054 (9th Cir.1999). Moreover, the Sleekcraft factors are not exhaustive and other variables may come into play depending on the particular facts presented. Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1145-46. This is particularly true in the Internet context. See Brookfield, 174 F.3d at 1054 (\"We must be acutely aware of excessive rigidity when applying the law in the Internet context; emerging technologies require a flexible approach.\"). Indeed, in evaluating claims of trademark infringement in cases involving Internet search engines, we have found particularly important an additional factor that is out-side of the eight-factor Sleekcraft test: \"the labeling and appearance of the advertisements and the surrounding context on the screen displaying the results page.\" Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1154.\n\nIn the present case, the eight-factor Sleekcraft test is not particularly apt. This is not surprising as the Sleekcraft test was developed for a different problem\u2014i.e., for analyzing whether two competing brands' marks are sufficiently similar to cause consumer confusion. See Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at 348. Although the present case involves brands that compete with MTM, such as Luminox, Chase-Durer, TAWATEC, and Modus, MTM does not contend that the marks for these competing brands are similar to its trademarks. Rather, MTM argues that the design of Amazon's search results page creates a likelihood of initial interest confusion2 because when a customer searches for MTM Special Ops watches on Amazon.com, the search results page displays the search term used\u2014here, \"mtm special ops\"\u2014followed by a display of numerous watches manufactured by MTM's competitors and offered for sale by Amazon, without explicitly informing the customer that Amazon does not carry MTM watches.\n\n[804 F.3d 937]\nThus, the present case focuses on a different type of confusion than was at issue in Sleekcraft. Here, the confusion is not caused by the design of the competitor's mark, but by the design of the web page that is displaying the competing mark and offering the competing products for sale. Sleekcraft aside, the ultimate test for determining likelihood of confusion is whether a \"reasonably prudent consumer\" in the marketplace is likely to be confused as to the origin of the goods. Dreamwerks, 142 F.3d at 1129. Our case can be resolved simply by a evaluation of the web page at issue and the relevant consumer. Cf. Brookfield, 174 F.3d at 1054 (\"[I]t is often possible to reach a conclusion with respect to likelihood of confusion after considering only a subset of the factors.\"). Indeed, we have previously noted that \"[i]n the keyword advertising context [i.e., where a user performs a search on the internet, and based on the keywords contained in the search, the resulting web page displays certain advertisements containing products or services for sale,] the `likelihood of confusion will ultimately turn on what the consumer saw on the screen and reasonably believed, given the context.'\" Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1153. In other words, the case will turn on the answers to the following two questions: (1) Who is the relevant reasonable consumer?; and (2) What would he reasonably believe based on what he saw on the screen?\n\nTurning to the first question, we have explained that \"[t]he nature of the goods and the type of consumer is highly relevant to determining the likelihood of confusion in the keyword advertising context.\" Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1152. \"In evaluating this factor, we consider `the typical buyer exercising ordinary caution.'\" Au-Tomotive Gold, Inc. v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 457 F.3d 1062, 1076 (9th Cir.2006) (quoting Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at 353). \"Confusion is less likely where buyers exercise care and precision in their purchases, such as for expensive or sophisticated items.\" Id. Moreover, \"the default degree of consumer care is becoming more heightened as the novelty of the Internet evaporates and online commerce becomes commonplace.\" Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1152.\n\nThe goods in the present case are expensive. It is undisputed that the watches at issue sell for several hundred dollars. Therefore, the relevant consumer in the present case \"is a reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online.\" Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. Tabari, 610 F.3d 1171, 1176 (9th Cir.2010).\n\nTurning to the second question, as MTM itself asserts, the labeling and appearance of the products for sale on Amazon's web page is the most important factor in this case. This is because we have previously noted that clear labeling can eliminate the likelihood of initial interest confusion in cases involving Internet search terms. See, e.g., Playboy Enters., 354 F.3d at 1030 n. 44 (explaining that clear labeling \"might eliminate the likelihood of initial interest confusion that exists in this case\"); Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1154 (same). Indeed, MTM itself argues: \"The common thread of [the Ninth Circuit's decisions in Brookfield, Playboy, and Network Automation] is that liability under the Lanham Act can only be avoided as a matter of law where there is clear labeling to avoid the possibility of confusion\u2014including initial interest confusion\u2014resulting from the use of another's trademark.\" Thus, MTM agrees that summary judgment of its trademark claims is appropriate if there is clear labeling that avoids likely confusion.\n\nHere, the products at issue are clearly labeled by Amazon to avoid any likelihood of initial interest confusion by a reasonably\n[804 F.3d 938]\nprudent consumer accustomed to online shopping. When a shopper goes to Amazon's website and searches for a product using MTM's trademark \"mtm special ops,\" the resulting page displays several products, all of which are clearly labeled with the product's name and manufacturer in large, bright, bold letters and includes a photograph of the item. In fact, the manufacturer's name is listed twice. For example, the first result is \"Luminox Men's 8401 Black Ops Watch by Luminox.\" The second result is \"Chase-Durer Men's 246.4BB7-XL-BR Special Forces 1000XL Black Ionic-Plated Underwater Demolition Team Watch by Chase-Durer.\" Because Amazon clearly labels each of the products for sale by brand name and model number accompanied by a photograph of the item, it is unreasonable to suppose that the reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online would be confused about the source of the goods.\n\nMTM argues that initial interest confusion might occur because Amazon lists the search term used\u2014here the trademarked phrase \"mtm special ops\"\u2014three times at the top of the search page. MTM argues that because Amazon lists the search term \"mtm special ops\" at the top of the page, a consumer might conclude that the products displayed are types of MTM watches. But, merely looking at Amazon's search results page shows that such consumer confusion is highly unlikely. None of these watches is labeled with the word \"MTM\" or the phrase \"Special Ops,\" let alone the specific phrase \"MTM Special Ops.\" Further, some of the products listed are not even watches. The sixth result is a book entitled \"Survive!: The Disaster, Crisis and Emergency Handbook by Jerry Ahem.\" The tenth result is a book entitled \"The Moses Expedition: A Novel by Juan Gomez-Jurado.\" No reasonably prudent consumer, accustomed to shopping online or not, would assume that a book entitled \"The Moses Expedition\" is a type of MTM watch or is in any way affiliated with MTM watches. Likewise, no reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online would view Amazon's search results page and conclude that the products offered are MTM watches. It is possible that someone, somewhere might be confused by the search results page. But, \"[u]nreasonable, imprudent and inexperienced web-shoppers are not relevant.\" Tabari, 610 F.3d at 1176; see also Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1153 (\"[W]e expect consumers searching for expensive products online to be even more sophisticated.\"). To establish likelihood of confusion, MTM must show that confusion is likely, not just possible. See Murray, 86 F.3d at 861.\n\nMTM argues that in order to eliminate the likelihood of confusion, Amazon must change its search results page so that it explains to customers that it does not offer MTM watches for sale before suggesting alternative watches to the customer. We disagree. The search results page makes clear to anyone who can read English that Amazon carries only the brands that are clearly and explicitly listed on the web page. The search results page is unambiguous\u2014not unlike when someone walks into a diner, asks for a Coke, and is told \"No Coke. Pepsi.\" See Multi Time Mach., Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 792 F.3d 1070, 1080-81 (9th Cir.2015) (Silverman, J., dissenting).\n\nIn light of the clear labeling Amazon uses on its search results page, no reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Amazon's search results page would likely confuse a reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online as to the source of the goods being offered. Cf. Playboy, 354 F.3d at 1030 n. 44 (Clear labeling \"might eliminate the likelihood of\n[804 F.3d 939]\ninitial interest confusion that exists in this case.\"); Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1154 (same). As Judge Berzon put it, \"I do not think it is reasonable to find initial interest confusion when a consumer is never confused as to source or affiliation, but instead knows, or should know, from the outset that a product or web link is not related to that of the trademark holder because the list produced by the search engine so informs him.\" Playboy, 354 F.3d at 1034-35 (9th Cir.2004) (Berzon, J., concurring).\n\nMTM attempts to argue that summary judgment of its claims is inappropriate because there are numerous factual disputes related to Amazon's search results page. But, to the extent there are factual disputes between the parties, none is material to the analysis. MTM cannot dispute the fact that the watches at issue sell for hundreds of dollars. Therefore, as a matter of law, the relevant consumer would be a reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online. See Tabari, 610 F.3d at 1176; Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1152-53. Further, MTM cannot dispute the contents of the web page at issue. A review of Amazon's web page shows that each product listed for sale is clearly labeled with the product's name and manufacturer and a photograph, and no product is labeled with MTM's mark. Thus, the undisputed facts show that it is highly unlikely that a reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online would be confused as to the source of the goods offered for sale on Amazon's web page.\n\nThe likelihood of confusion is often a question of fact, but not always. In a case such as this, where a court can conclude that the consumer confusion alleged by the trademark holder is highly unlikely by simply reviewing the product listing/advertisement at issue, summary judgment is appropriate. Cf. M2 Software, 421 F.3d at 1085 (explaining that summary judgment of a trademark claim is appropriate where the plaintiff has failed to present \"sufficient evidence to permit a rational trier of fact to find that confusion is `probable,' not merely `possible'\"). Indeed, in the similar context of evaluating claims of consumer deception when dealing with false advertising claims, we have at least twice concluded\u2014after a review of the label or advertisement at issue\u2014that there was no likelihood of consumer deception as a matter of law because no reasonable consumer could have been deceived by the label/advertisement at issue in the manner alleged by the plaintiff. See, e.g., Davis v. HSBC Bank, 691 F.3d 1152, 1162 (9th Cir.2012); Freeman v. Time, Inc., 68 F.3d 285, 289-90 (9th Cir.1995).\n\nFurther, we are able to conclude that summary judgment is appropriate in the present case without delving into any factors other than: (1) the type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser; and (2) the labeling and appearance of the products for sale and the surrounding context on the screen displaying the results page. Cf. Brookfield, 174 F.3d at 1054 (\"[I]t is often possible to reach a conclusion with respect to likelihood of confusion after considering only a subset of the factors\"). However, if we were to evaluate each of the remaining Sleekcraft factors, those factors would not change our conclusion, here, because those factors are either neutral or unimportant.\n\n\"Actual confusion\"\u2014We have held that \"[a] showing of actual confusion among significant numbers of consumers provides strong support for the likelihood of confusion.\" Playboy, 354 F.3d at 1026 (noting that a strong showing by the plaintiff in regard to this factor alone can reverse a grant of summary judgment). However,\n[804 F.3d 940]\nhere, there is no evidence of actual confusion. The only \"evidence\" MTM presented to the district court of actual confusion is the deposition testimony of MTM's president stating that someone named Eric told him, in reference to Amazon's web page, \"it's confusing.\" Hearsay problems aside, this testimony is too speculative to show actual confusion because there is no evidence showing that Eric was a potential consumer. Indeed, at oral argument, MTM conceded that it does not have evidence of actual consumer confusion. Therefore, this factor does not weigh in MTM's favor.\n\n\"Defendant's Intent\"\u2014We have also held that \"[a] defendant's intent to confuse constitutes probative evidence of likely confusion: Courts assume that the defendant's intentions were carried out successfully.\" Playboy, 354 F.3d at 1028 (footnote omitted). MTM argues that the design of Amazon's search results page is evidence of its intent to cause confusion. The design, however, indisputably produces results that are clearly labeled as to the type of product and brand. Amazon has designed its results page to alleviate any possible confusion about the source of the products by clearly labeling each of its products with the product's name and manufacturer. Therefore, this factor also does not weigh in MTM's favor.\n\n\"Strength of the Mark\"\u2014MTM argues that it has presented sufficient evidence below from which a jury could properly conclude that its trademark is both conceptually strong and commercially strong. However, we find that this factor is unimportant under the circumstances of this case. Even assuming MTM's mark is one of the strongest in the world\u2014on the same level as Apple, Coke, Disney, or McDonald's\u2014there is still no likelihood of confusion because Amazon clearly labels the source of the products it offers for sale.\n\nFurther, as we previously found in Network Automation, the remaining Sleekcraft factors are unimportant in a case, such as this, involving Internet search terms where the competing products are clearly labeled and the relevant consumer would exercise a high degree of care. See Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1150-53 (finding \"proximity of goods,\" \"similarity of marks,\" \"marketing channels,\" and \"likelihood of expansion\" to be unimportant in a trademark case involving Internet search terms where the advertisements are clearly labeled and the relevant consumers would exercise a high degree of care).\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nIn light of Amazon's clear labeling of the products it carries, by brand name and model, accompanied by a photograph of the item, no rational trier of fact could find that a reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online would likely be confused by the Amazon search results. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Amazon.\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\nBEA, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nToday the panel holds that when it comes to internet commerce, judges, not jurors, decide what labeling may confuse shoppers. In so doing, the court departs from our own trademark precedent and from our summary judgment jurisprudence. Because I believe that an Amazon shopper seeking an MTM watch might well initially think that the watches Amazon offers for sale when he searches \"MTM Special Ops\" are affiliated with MTM, I must dissent.\n\n[804 F.3d 941]\nIf her brother mentioned MTM Special Ops watches, a frequent internet shopper might try to purchase one for him through her usual internet retail sites, perhaps Overstock.com, Buy.com, and Amazon.com.1 At Overstock's site, if she typed \"MTM special ops,\" the site would respond \"Sorry, your search: `mtm special ops' returned no results.\" Similarly, at Buy.com, she would be informed \"0 results found. Sorry. Your search for mtm special ops did not return an exact match. Please try your search again.\"\n\nThings are a little different over at \"Earth's most customer-centric company,\" as Amazon styles itself. There, if she were to enter \"MTM Special Ops\" as her search request on the Amazon website, Amazon would respond with its page showing (1) MTM Special Ops in the search field (2) \"MTM Specials Ops\" again\u2014in quotation marks\u2014immediately below the search field and (3) yet again in the phrase \"Related Searches: MTM special ops watch,\" (emphasis in original) all before stating \"Showing 10 Results.\" What the website's response will not state is the truth recognized by its competitors: that Amazon does not carry MTM products any more than do Overstock.com or Buy.com. Rather, below the search field, and below the second and third mentions of \"MTM Special Ops\" noted above, the site will display aesthetically similar, multi-function watches manufactured by MTM's competitors. The shopper will see that Luminox and Chase-Durer watches are offered for sale, in response to her MTM query.2\n\nMTM asserts the shopper might be confused into thinking a relationship exists between Luminox and MTM; she may think that MTM was acquired by Luminox, or that MTM manufactures component parts of Luminox watches, for instance. As a result of this initial confusion, MTM asserts, she might look into buying a Luminox watch, rather than junk the quest altogether and seek to buy an MTM watch elsewhere. MTM asserts that Amazon's use of MTM's trademarked name is likely to confuse buyers, who may ultimately buy a competitor's goods.\n\nMTM may be mistaken. But whether MTM is mistaken is a question that requires a factual determination, one this court does not have authority to make.\n\nBy usurping the jury function, the majority today makes new trademark law. When we allow a jury to determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion, as I would, we do not make trademark law, because we announce no new principle by which to adjudicate trademark disputes. Today's brief majority opinion accomplishes a great deal: the majority announces a new rule of law, resolves whether \"clear labeling\" favors Amazon using its own judgment, and, sub silentio, overrules this court's \"initial interest confusion\" doctrine.\n\nCapturing initial consumer attention has been recognized by our court to be a\n[804 F.3d 942]\ngrounds for finding of infringement of the Lanham Act since 1997. Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. v. Penguin Books USA, Inc., 109 F.3d 1394, 1405 (9th Cir.1997) (identifying \"initial consumer attention\" as a basis for infringement). In 1999, citing Dr. Seuss, we expressly adopted the initial interest confusion doctrine in the internet context, and never repudiated it. Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1062 (9th Cir.1999). It may not apply where the competing goods or services are \"clearly labeled\" such that they cause only mere diversion, but whether such goods or services are clearly labeled so as to prevent a prudent internet shopper's initial confusion depends on the overall function and presentation of the web page. The issue is whether a prudent internet shopper who made the search request and saw the Amazon result\u2014top to bottom\u2014would more likely than not be affected by that \"initial interest confusion.\" That is, an impression\u2014when first shown the results of the requested MTM Special Ops search\u2014that Amazon carries watches that have some connection to MTM, and that those watches are sold under the name Luminox or Chase-Durer. Whether there is likelihood of such initial interest confusion, I submit, is a jury question. Intimations in our case law that initial interest confusion is bad doctrine notwithstanding, it is the law of our circuit, and, I submit, the most fair reading of the Lanham Act.\n\nTellingly, the majority does not cite to the statutory text, which provides that the nonconsensual use of a registered trademark will infringe where \"such use is likely to cause confusion, or cause mistake, or deceive.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1)(a). The majority reads the statute to contain language that it does not, essentially reading the clause \"at point of sale\" into the end of \u00a7 1114(1)(a). Similarly, the majority reads 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125 to apply only at point of sale\u2014the majority writes that it is unreasonable to suppose that a reasonably prudent consumer accustomed to shopping online would be confused about the source of the goods where Luminox and Chase-Durer watches are labeled as such, but does not address the possibility that a reasonably prudent consumer might initially assume that those brands enjoyed some affiliation with MTM which, in turn, could cause such a shopper to investigate brands which otherwise would not have been of interest to her.3\n\nTo reach its conclusion, the majority purports to apply this court's precedent in Network Automation, Inc. v. Advanced Systems Concepts, Inc., 638 F.3d 1137, 1145 (9th Cir.2011). In so doing, the majority ignores the procedural posture of that case. There, plaintiff Network Automation and defendant Advanced Systems Concepts both sold job scheduling and management software. Id. at 1142. Network Automation advertised its product by purchasing certain keywords\u2014including registered trademarks belonging to Advanced Systems\u2014which, when typed into various search engines, included Network Automation's website \"www.Network Automation.com\" as a labeled, sponsored link among the search results. Id. Advanced Systems alleged violation of the Lanham Act and moved for a preliminary injunction. Id. at 1143. The district court granted a preliminary injunction to Advanced Systems, and Network Automation\n[804 F.3d 943]\nappealed. Id. On appeal, this court reversed and vacated the preliminary injunction.\n\nTo do so, this court did not find that there was no genuine issue of fact as to likelihood of confusion. Instead, this court properly considered whether the facts, as the court understood them, favored Advanced Systems in Network Automation because a preliminary injunction requires \"the moving party [there, the plaintiff alleging infringement] demonstrate a fair chance of success on the merits or questions serious enough to require litigation.\" Arc of California v. Douglas, 757 F.3d 975, 993 (9th Cir.2014). Therefore, the Network Automation court properly considered the weight of the evidence to decide whether Advanced Systems had a fair chance of success on the merits. Here, we are not tasked to determine whether MTM is likely to succeed, nor to consider the weight of the evidence. As this is an appeal from a summary judgment, we must decide whether the non-moving party (MTM) tendered a genuine issue of fact. Network Automation did not announce a rule that clear labeling is per se a question of law, nor that a judge's determination that products are clearly labeled precludes a triable issue of fact as to trademark infringement.\n\nIndeed, even if Network Automation were not so readily distinguishable by its procedural posture, it is factually distinguishable. In Network Automation, the \"diversionary\" goods were clearly labeled on the response page as \"Sponsored Links,\" showing that the producers of those products were the ones advertising for themselves, not for the firm named in the search request. Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1144. Unlike the sponsored links at issue in Network Automation, and unlike its competitors Buy.com and Overstock.com, Amazon does not forestall any confusion by informing customers who are searching \"MTM Special Ops\" that Amazon does not carry any such products. Amazon does just the opposite. It responds by twice naming MTM, and once specifically naming watches.\n\nOn this record, a jury could infer that users who are confused by the search results are confused as to why MTM products are not listed. There is a question of fact whether users who are confused by the search result will wonder whether a competitor has acquired MTM or is otherwise affiliated with or approved by MTM. See Brookfield Communications, 174 F.3d at 1057. This is especially true as to a brand like MTM, as many luxury brands with distinct marks are produced by manufacturers of lower-priced, better-known brands\u2014just as Honda manufactures Acura automobiles but sells Acura automobiles under a distinct mark that is marketed to wealthier purchasers, and Timex manufactures watches for luxury fashion houses Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo. Like MTM, Luminox manufactures luxury watches, and a customer might think that MTM and Luminox are manufactured by the same parent company. The possibility of initial interest confusion here is likely much higher than if, for instance, a customer using an online grocery website typed \"Coke\" and only Pepsi products were returned as results. No shopper would think that Pepsi was simply a higher end version of Coke, or that Pepsi had acquired Coke's secret recipe and started selling it under the Pepsi mark.\n\nIn any event, even as to expensive goods\u2014for instance, pianos sold under a mark very similar to the famous Steinway and Sons brand's mark\u2014the issue is not that a buyer might buy a piano manufactured by someone other than Steinway thinking that it was a Steinway. The issue is that the defendant's use of the mark\n[804 F.3d 944]\nwould cause initial interest confusion by attracting potential customers' attention to buy the infringing goods because of the trademark holder's hard-won reputation. Brookfield, 174 F.3d at 1063 (citing Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf v. Steinway & Sons, 523 F.2d 1331, 1341-42 (2d Cir.1975)).\n\nA jury could infer that the labeling of the search results, and Amazon's failure to notify customers that it does not have results that match MTM's mark, give rise to initial interest confusion. If so, a jury could find that Amazon customers searching for MTM products are subject to more than mere diversion, since MTM is not required to show that customers are likely to be confused at the point of sale. Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp., 354 F.3d 1020, 1025 (9th Cir.2004).\n\nAssuming arguendo that the majority properly found that Amazon's search results are clearly labeled, the majority extends its factual determinations further by determining that in this case, clear labeling outweighs the other eight factors considered in trademark suits, factors that remain the law of this circuit: (1) strength of the mark(s); (2) proximity or relatedness of the goods; (3) similarity of the marks; (4) evidence of actual confusion; (5) marketing channels; (6) degree of consumer care; (7) the defendants' intent; and (8) likelihood of expansion. Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1145 (citing AMF v. Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341, 348-49 (9th Cir.1979)). To be sure, courts must be flexible in their application of the factors, as some may not apply in every case. Playboy, 354 F.3d at 1026. Here, for instance, the likelihood of expansion does not apply because both MTM and Amazon already sell luxury watches, so whether either is likely to expand its sales into the luxury watch market is not a question. However, where the Sleekcraft factors could tip in either direction, there is a jury question. Fortune Dynamic, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores Brand Management, Inc., 618 F.3d 1025, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). Simply stating that the Sleekcraft factors do not favor the plaintiff, or don't bear on the clarity of the labeling, does not resolve the underlying factual question.\n\nHaving exercised its own judgment to determine that this presentation is not confusing, the majority purports to consider the Sleekcraft factors, though the opinion essentially states that some of the factors are per se irrelevant\u2014for instance, as to the Sleekcraft factor, \"strength of the mark,\" the majority assert that \"under the circumstances of this case,\" the factor is unimportant because \"Amazon clearly labels the source of the products it offers for sale.\" op. at 940. By reiterating the conclusion at which it had already arrived, the majority ignores the factor and the fact-intensive analysis it entails. A mark's strength is a measure of how uniquely identified it is with a product or service, and therefore how deserving of trademark protection. Fortune Dynamic, 618 F.3d at 1032. \"A mark's conceptual strength depends largely on the obviousness of its connection to the good or service to which it refers. The less obvious the connection, the stronger the mark, and vice versa.\" Id. at 1032. Conceptual strength is considered along a continuum, and in this circuit, marks may be classified as falling into one of five categories, from conceptually weak to conceptually strong: generic, descriptive, suggestive, arbitrary, or fanciful. Fortune Dynamic, 618 F.3d at 1033. Whether a mark is descriptive or suggestive is a question of fact. Id. at 1034. In an infringement suit, \"the distinction [between a descriptive and suggestive mark] is important because if the mark is suggestive, there is a stronger likelihood that the `strength of the mark' factor favors the\n[804 F.3d 945]\n[plaintiff].\" Id. Here, the phrase \"MTM Special Ops\" requires \"a mental leap from the mark to the product,\" because the phrase does not expressly refer to watches. Fortune Dynamic, 618 F.3d at 1033. Indeed, by evoking elite military forces (\"Special Ops\"), the goods suggested by the phrase are as likely to be protective gear, binoculars, weapons, or boots as they are watches. A jury could find that the mark is suggestive and conceptually strong because it does not obviously refer to watches, or that it is merely descriptive because the watches are made in a military style. Either way, the weight of the evidence is a question of fact, and there is a genuine issue of fact as to the conceptual strength of the mark. As in Fortune Dynamic, \"a jury should assess the conceptual strength of [plaintiff's] mark in the first instance.\" 618 F.3d at 1033. However, the majority simply brushes off the question as irrelevant \"under the circumstances.\" The circumstances surrounding the case are questions of fact, not law, and should be given to a jury to determine.\n\nSimilarly, the majority finds that Amazon's intent weighs in favor of Amazon. A defendant's intent is relevant because a \"defendant's intent to confuse constitutes probative evidence of likely confusion.\" Playboy, 354 F.3d at 1029. MTM submitted evidence that Amazon vendors and customers had complained to Amazon because they did not understand why they received certain non-responsive search results when they searched for products that are not carried by Amazon. The evidence showed that Amazon employees did not take action to address the complaints by explaining to the public how its search function works.4 One Amazon employee noted that explaining BBS to the public might draw customers' and vendors' unwanted scrutiny to the matter. Amazon did not disclose to shoppers that its search function responds to customer behavior.\n\nAs in Playboy, this evidence suggests, \"at a minimum, that defendants do nothing to alleviate confusion . . . Although not definitive, this factor provides some evidence of an intent to confuse on the part of defendants.\" Playboy, 354 F.3d at 1029. From evidence that \"Earth's most customer-centric company\" took no action on these complaints, a jury could infer that Amazon intended to confuse its customers.\n\nThe majority ignores this evidence on the basis of its conclusion that Amazon created a page with clearly labeled wares, and further concludes that Amazon must not have intended to confuse customers, or its page would not be clearly labeled. op. at 939-40. However, to conclude that there is no triable issue of fact, the majority may not overlook or ignore evidence to the contrary in the record, or assume that a jury would weigh evidence the same way that the panel does.\n\nFinally, the majority repeatedly states that not only does Amazon clearly label its\n[804 F.3d 946]\nproducts, but there is no evidence of actual confusion. Assuming arguendo that there is no evidence from which a jury could infer actual confusion,5 the absence of actual confusion is not dispositive of whether there is a genuine issue of fact. Where evidence of actual confusion is submitted, it is \"strong support for the likelihood of confusion.\" Network Automation, 638 F.3d at 1151. But actual confusion \"is not necessary to a finding of likelihood of confusion under the Lanham Act. Indeed, proving actual confusion is difficult and the courts have often discounted such evidence because it was unclear or insubstantial.\" Id. A plaintiff need not show actual confusion to prevail.\n\nThrough its cursory review of the Sleekcraft factors and conclusory statements about clear labeling, the majority purports to apply this circuit's trademark law, and ignores the doctrine of initial interest confusion. In so doing, the majority today writes new trademark law and blurs the line between innovation and infringement.\n\nMore troubling, the majority ignores the role of the jury. Summary judgment law is an aid to judicial economy, but it can be so only to the extent that it comports with the Seventh Amendment. Were we to reverse and remand, MTM might well lose. The likelihood of that outcome is irrelevant to the question whether there is a genuine issue of fact. I respectfully dissent.\n\nFootNotes\n\n\n* The Honorable Gordon J. Quist, Senior District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, sitting by designation.\n1. The eight factors enumerated in Sleekcraft are as follows: \"1. strength of the mark; 2. proximity of the goods; 3. similarity of the marks; 4. evidence of actual confusion; 5. marketing channels used; 6. type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser; 7. defendant's intent in selecting the mark; and 8. likelihood of expansion of the product lines.\" 599 F.2d at 348-49.\n2. \"Initial interest confusion is customer confusion that creates initial interest in a competitor's product. Although dispelled before an actual sale occurs, initial interest confusion impermissibly capitalizes on the goodwill associated with a mark and is therefore actionable trademark infringement.\" Playboy Enters. v. Netscape Commc'ns Corp., 354 F.3d 1020, 1025 (9th Cir.2004).\nFollowing the issuance of the original opinion in this action, several amici filed briefs questioning the validity of the doctrine of initial interest confusion in the context of the Internet. However, in the present appeal, the parties did not dispute the application of the doctrine of initial interest confusion, and we as a three-judge panel are bound by the precedent of our court. See Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir.2003) (\"[A] three-judge panel may not overrule a prior decision of the court.\").\n\n1. MTM sells its products only through its own approved distributors.\n2. As of June 17, 2015, the shopper might be subject to even more confusion if she began her search of Amazon's wares through Google. If she searched Google for \"Amazon MTM special ops watch,\" one of the search results would be a static page on Amazon's website. Amazon's static webpage stated that \"At Amazon.com, we not only have a large collection of mtm special ops watch products [which, of course, is flatly untrue], but also a comprehensive set of reviews from our customers. Below we've selected a subset of mtm special ops watch products [a repetition of the untruth] and the corresponding reviews to help you do better research, and choose the product that best suits your needs.\" Amazon, http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1001909381. Amazon has since removed the page.\n3. Any person who \"uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device . . . which is likely to cause confusion . . . as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services of commercial activities\" is also subject to injunction and liable for damages to one likely to be damaged. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1).\n4. Amazon's search algorithm responds to its customers' behavior using a Behavior Based Search (\"BBS\") technology, which uses data about what customers view and purchase after searching certain terms. Amazon does not program the terms; the function responds solely to customer behavior. If enough customers search for a certain keyword, \"X,\" and then look at or purchase another product \"Y,\" even if X and Y are not obviously related, future customers who search for X may receive search results including Y. But the BBS function is not solely responsible for the search results. The results list also includes matches based on a search of terms on Amazon's pages\u2014for instance, streaming video of a show called Special Ops Mission may be called up. Whether a particular result appears because of BBS or a traditional search of matching terms is not evident from the matches, and the relevant products (which are based on search terms) and recommended products (based on BBS) are mingled together.\n5. Amazon submitted evidence that purports to show that no customers were confused, because customers who searched for \"Luminox\" were 21 times as likely to purchase a Luminox watch as were customers who searched for \"MTM Special Ops.\" It isn't surprising that customers who search for an item (Luminox watches) are more likely to buy that item than customers who did not search for it but searched for another product (MTM watches). However, a jury might view this purported evidence of no actual confusion as flawed because a user researching watches might initially be confused about the availability of MTM watches online and so not purchase a Luminox the same day. Further, some users did search for \"MTM Special Ops\" and purchase a competitor's watch the same day, which a jury could find probative of some confusion.\n", "annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 19},

Conciatori, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, L.L.P., New York City, for MP3.Com, Inc.\n\nOPINION\n\nRAKOFF, District Judge.\n\nThe complex marvels of cyberspatial communication may create difficult legal issues; but not in this case. Defendant's infringement of plaintiffs' copyrights is clear. Accordingly, on April 28, 2000, the Court granted defendant's motion for partial summary judgment holding defendant liable for copyright infringement. This opinion will state the reasons why.\n\nThe pertinent facts, either undisputed or, where disputed, taken most favorably to defendant, are as follows:\n\nThe technology known as \"MP3\" permits rapid and efficient conversion of compact disc recordings (\"CDs\") to computer files easily accessed over the Internet. See generally Recording Industry Ass'n of America v. Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc., 180 F.3d 1072, 1073-74 (9th Cir. 1999). Utilizing this technology, defendant MP3.com, on or around January 12, 2000, launched its \"My.MP3.com\" service, which is advertised as permitting subscribers to store, customize and listen to the recordings contained on their CDs from any place where they have an Internet connection. To make good on this offer, defendant purchased tens of thousands of popular CDs in which plaintiffs held the copyrights, and, without authorization, copied their recordings onto its computer servers so as to be able to replay the recordings for its subscribers.\n\nSpecifically, in order to first access such a recording, a subscriber to MP3.com must either \"prove\" that he already owns the CD version of the recording by inserting his copy of the commercial CD into his computer CD-Rom drive for a few seconds (the \"Beam-it Service\") or must purchase the CD from one of defendant's cooperating online retailers (the \"instant Listening Service\"). Thereafter, however, the subscriber can access via the Internet from a computer anywhere in the world the copy of plaintiffs' recording made by defendant. Thus, although defendant seeks to portray its service as the \"functional equivalent\" of storing its subscribers' CDs, in actuality defendant is re-playing for the subscribers converted versions of the recordings it copied, without authorization, from plaintiffs' copyrighted CDs. On its face, this makes out a presumptive case of infringement under the Copyright Act of 1976 (\"Copyright Act\"), 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq. See, e.g., Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group, Inc., 150 F.3d 132, 137 (2d Cir.1998); Hasbro Bradley, Inc. v. Sparkle Toys, Inc., 780 F.2d 189, 192 (2d Cir.1985).[1]\n\nDefendant argues, however, that such copying is protected by the affirmative defense of \"fair use.\" See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. In analyzing such a defense, the Copyright Act specifies four factors that must be considered: \"(1) the purpose and *351 character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\" Id. Other relevant factors may also be considered, since fair use is an \"equitable rule of reason\" to be applied in light of the overall purposes of the Copyright Act. Sony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 448, 454, 104 S. Ct. 774, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1984); see Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 549, 105 S. Ct. 2218, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1985).\n\nRegarding the first factor \u0097 \"the purpose and character of the use\" \u0097 defendant does not dispute that its purpose is commercial, for while subscribers to My. MP3.com are not currently charged a fee, defendant seeks to attract a sufficiently large subscription base to draw advertising and otherwise make a profit. Consideration of the first factor, however, also involves inquiring into whether the new use essentially repeats the old or whether, instead, it \"transforms\" it by infusing it with new meaning, new understandings, or the like. See, e.g., Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569, 579, 114 S. Ct. 1164,  127 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1994); Castle Rock, 150 F.3d at 142; See also Pierre N. Leval, \"Toward a Fair Use Standard,\" 103 Harv. L.Rev. 1105, 111 (1990). Here, although defendant recites that My.MP3.com provides a transformative \"space shift\" by which subscribers can enjoy the sound recordings contained on their CDs without lugging around the physical discs themselves, this is simply another way of saying that the unauthorized copies are being retransmitted in another medium \u0097 an insufficient basis for any legitimate claim of transformation, See, e.g., Infinity Broadcast Corp. v. Kirkwood, 150 F.3d 104, 108 (2d Cir.1998) (rejecting the fair use defense by operator of a service that retransmitted copyrighted radio broadcasts over telephone lines); Los Angeles News Serv. v. Reuters Television Int'l Ltd., 149 F.3d 987 (9th Cir.1998) (rejecting the fair use defense where television news agencies copied copyrighted news footage and retransmitted it to news organizations), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1141, 119 S. Ct. 1032, 143 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1999); see also American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913, 923 (2d Cir.), cert. dismissed, 516 U.S. 1005, 116 S. Ct. 592, 133 L. Ed. 2d 486 (1995); Basic Books, Inc. v. Kinko's Graphics Corp., 758 F. Supp. 1522, 1530-31 (S.D.N.Y.1991); see generally Leval, supra, at 1111 (repetition of copyrighted material that \"merely repackages or republishes the original\" is unlikely to be deemed a fair use).\n\nHere, defendant adds no new \"new aesthetics, new insights and understandings\" to the original music recordings it copies, see Castle Rock, 150 F.3d at 142 (internal quotation marks omitted), but simply repackages those recordings to facilitate their transmission through another medium. While such services may be innovative, they are not transformative.[2]\n\nRegarding the second factor \u0097 \"the nature of the copyrighted work\" \u0097 the creative recordings here being copied are \"close[ ] to the core of intended copyright protection,\" Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586, 114 S. Ct. 1164, and, conversely, far removed from the more factual or descriptive work more amenable to \"fair use,\" see Nihon *352 Keizai Shimbun, Inc. v. Comline Business Data, Inc., 166 F.3d 65, 72-73 (2d Cir. 1999); see also Castle Rock, 150 F.3d at 143-44.\n\nRegarding the third factor \u0097 \"the amount and substantiality of the portion [of the copyrighted work] used [by the copier] in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole\" \u0097 it is undisputed that defendant copies, and replays, the entirety of the copyrighted works here in issue, thus again negating any claim of fair use. See Infinity Broadcast, 150 F.3d at 109 (\"[T]he more of a copyrighted work that is taken, the less likely the use is to be fair ....\"); see generally Leval, supra, at 1122 (\"[T]he larger the volume ... of what is taken, the greater the affront to the interests of the copyright owner, and the less likely that a taking will qualify as a fair use\").\n\nRegarding the fourth factor \u0097 \"the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work\" \u0097 defendant's activities on their face invade plaintiffs' statutory right to license their copyrighted sound recordings to others for reproduction. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106. Defendant, however, argues that, so far as the derivative market here involves is concerned, plaintiffs have not shown that such licensing is \"traditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed.\" American Geophysical, 60 F.3d at 930 & n. 17. Moreover, defendant argues, its activities can only enhance plaintiffs' sales, since subscribers cannot gain access to particular recordings made available by MP3.com unless they have already \"purchased\" (actually or purportedly), or agreed to purchase, their own CD copies of those recordings.\n\nSuch arguments \u0097 though dressed in the garb of an expert's \"opinion\" (that, on inspection, consists almost entirely of speculative and conclusory statements) \u0097 are unpersuasive. Any allegedly positive impact of defendant's activities on plaintiffs' prior market in no way frees defendant to usurp a further market that directly derives from reproduction of the plaintiffs' copyrighted works. See Infinity Broadcast, 150 F.3d at 111. This would be so even if the copyrightholder had not yet entered the new market in issue, for a copyrighterholder's \"exclusive\" rights, derived from the Constitution and the Copyright Act, include the right, within broad limits, to curb the development of such a derivative market by refusing to license a copyrighted work or by doing so only on terms the copyright owner finds acceptable. See Castle Rock, 150 F.3d at 145-46; Salinger v. Random House, Inc., 811 F.2d 90, 99 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 890,  108 S. Ct. 213, 98 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1987). Here, moreover, plaintiffs have adduced substantial evidence that they have in fact taken steps to enter that market by entering into various licensing agreements. See, e.g., Forrest R. Aff., Ex. F., Vidich Dep. at 61-63; id., Ex. N; Goodman R. Aff., Ex. B., Silver Dep. at 64-65; id., Ex. D, Eisenberg Dep. at 130-32; id., Ex. E., Evans Dep. 145-48.\n\nFinally, regarding defendant's purported reliance on other factors, see Campbell, 510 U.S. at 577, 114 S. Ct. 1164, this essentially reduces to the claim that My. MP3.com provides a useful service to consumers that, in its absence, will be served by \"pirates.\" Copyright, however, is not designed to afford consumer protection or convenience but, rather, to protect the copyrightholders' property interests. Moreover, as a practical matter, plaintiffs have indicated no objection in principle to licensing their recordings to companies like MP3.com; they simply want to make sure they get the remuneration the law reserves for them as holders of copyrights on creative works. Stripped to its essence, defendant's \"consumer protection\" argument amounts to nothing more than a bald claim that defendant should be able to misappropriate plaintiffs' property simply because there is a consumer demand for it. This hardly appeals to the conscience of equity.\n\nIn sum, on any view, defendant's \"fair use\" defense is indefensible and must be denied as a matter of law. Defendant's *353 other affirmative defenses, such as copyright misuse, abandonment, unclean hands, and estoppel, are essentially frivolous and may be disposed of briefly. While defendant contends, under the rubric of copyright misuse, that plaintiffs are misusing their \"dominant market position to selectively prosecute only certain online music technology companies,\" Def.'s Consolidated Opp. to Pls.' Motions for Summ.J. at 21, the admissible evidence of records shows only that plaintiffs have reasonably exercised their right to determine which infringers to pursue, and in which order to pursue them, cf. Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Peppermint Club, Inc., 1985 WL 6141, at *4 (N.D.Ohio Dec.16, 1985). The abandonment defense must also fall since defendant has failed to adduce any competent evidence of an overt act indicating that plaintiffs, who filed suit against MP3.com shortly after MP3.com launched its infringing My.MP3.com service, intentionally abandoned their copyrights. See Richard Feiner & Co., Inc. v. H.R. Indus., Inc., 10 F. Supp. 2d 310, 313 (S.D.N.Y.1998). Similarly, defendant's estoppel defense must be rejected because defendant has failed to provide any competent evidence that it relied on any action by plaintiffs with respect to defendant's My.MP3.com service. Finally, the Court must reject defendant's unclean hands defense given defendant's failure to come forth with any admissible evidence showing bad faith or misconduct on the part of plaintiffs. See generally Dunlop-McCullen v. Local 1-S, AFL-CIO-CLC, 149 F.3d 85, 90 (2d Cir.1998); A.H. Emery Co. v. Marcan Prods. Corp., 389 F.2d 11, 18 n. 4 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 835, 89 S. Ct. 109, 21 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1968).[3]\n\nThe Court has also considered defendant's other points and arguments and finds them sufficiently without merit as not to warrant any further comment.\n\nAccordingly, the Court, for the foregoing reasons, has determined that plaintiffs are entitled to partial summary judgment holding defendant to have infringed plaintiffs' copyrights.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] Defendant's only challenge to plaintiffs' prima facie case of infringement is the suggestion, buried in a footnote in its opposition papers, that its music computer files are not in fact \"reproductions\" of plaintiffs' copyrighted works within the meaning of the Copyright Act. See, e.g., 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 114(b). Specifically, defendant claims that the simulated sounds on MP3-based music files are not physically identical to the sounds on the original CD recordings. See Def.'s Consolidated Opp. to Pls.' Motions for Partial Summ.J. at 13-14 n. 9. Defendant concedes, however, that the human ear cannot detect a difference between the two. Id. Moreover, defendant admits that a goal of its copying is to create a music file that is sonically as identical to the original CD as possible. See Goodman Reply Aff., Robertson Dep., Ex. A, at 85. In such circumstances, some slight, humanly undetectable difference between the original and the copy does not qualify for exclusion from the coverage of the Act.\n\n[2] Defendant's reliance on the Ninth Circuit's \"reverse engineering\" cases, see Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corp., 203 F.3d 596 (9th Cir.2000); Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510, 1527 (9th Cir.1992), is misplaced, because, among other relevant distinctions, those cases involved the copying of software in order to develop a new product, see Sony Computer Entertainment, 203 F.3d at 606; Sega Enterprises, 977 F.2d at 1522, whereas here defendant copied CDs onto its servers not to create any new form of expression but rather to retransmit the same expression in a different medium.\n\n[3] The Court also finds no reason to alter or postpone its determination simply because of the recent filing of the complaint in Lester Chambers et al. v. Time Warner, Inc., et al., 00 Civ. 2839 (S.D.N.Y. filed Apr. 12, 2000) (JSR), the allegations of which, according to the defendant here, call into question the exclusivity of plaintiffs' copyrights.

The facts, as seen in the light most favorable to the government, are these. The defendant, David LaMacchia, is a twenty-one year old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). LaMacchia, a computer hacker, used MIT's computer network to gain entree to the Internet. Using pseudonyms and an encrypted address, LaMacchia set up an electronic bulletin board which he named Cynosure.[1] He encouraged his correspondents to upload popular software applications (Excel 5.0 and WordPerfect 6.0) and computer games (Sim City 2000). These he transferred to a second encrypted address (Cynosure II) where they could be downloaded by other users with access to the Cynosure password. Although LaMacchia was at pains to impress the need for circumspection on the part of his subscribers, the worldwide traffic generated by the offer of free software attracted the notice of university and federal authorities.\n\nOn April 7, 1994, a federal grand jury returned a one count indictment charging LaMacchia with conspiring with \"persons unknown\" to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, the wire fraud statute. According to the indictment, LaMacchia devised a scheme to defraud that had as its object the facilitation \"on an international scale\" of the \"illegal copying and distribution of copyrighted software\" without payment of licensing fees and royalties to software manufacturers and vendors. The indictment alleges that LaMacchia's scheme *537 caused losses of more than one million dollars to software copyright holders. The indictment does not allege that LaMacchia sought or derived any personal benefit from the scheme to defraud.\n\nOn September 30, 1994, the defendant brought a motion to dismiss, arguing that the government had improperly resorted to the wire fraud statute as a copyright enforcement tool in defiance of the Supreme Court's decision in Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 105 S. Ct. 3127,  87 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1985). The government argues that Dowling is a narrower case than LaMacchia would have it, and holds only that copyright infringement does not satisfy the physical \"taking\" requirement of the National Stolen Property Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314.\n\nTHE DOWLING DECISION\n\nPaul Edmond Dowling was convicted of conspiracy, interstate transportation of stolen property [ITSP], copyright violations and mail fraud in the Central District of California. Dowling and his co-conspirators sold bootleg Elvis Presley recordings by soliciting catalogue orders from post office boxes in Glendale, California. The infringing recordings were shipped in interstate commerce to Maryland and Florida. The eight ITSP counts on which Dowling was convicted involved thousands of phonograph albums. \"[E]ach album contained performances of copyrighted musical compositions for the use of which no licenses had been obtained nor royalties paid....\" Dowling, supra at 212, 105 S.Ct. at 3130. Dowling appealed his convictions (except those involving copyright infringement). The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \"[T]he [Ninth Circuit] reasoned that the rights of copyright owners in their protected property were indistinguishable from ownership interests in other types of property and were equally deserving of protection under the [stolen property] statute.\" Id.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted certiorari only as to Dowling's convictions for interstate transportation of stolen property.[2] The Court, in an opinion by Justice Blackmun, held that a copyrighted musical composition impressed on a bootleg phonograph record is not property that is \"stolen, converted, or taken by fraud\" within the meaning of the Stolen Property Act. Justice Blackmun emphasized that cases prosecuted under \u00a7 2314 had traditionally involved \"physical `goods, wares [or] merchandise.'\" The statute \"seems clearly to contemplate a physical identity between the items unlawfully obtained and those eventually transported, and hence some prior physical taking of the subject goods\" Id. at 216, 105 S.Ct. at 3133. In Dowling's case there was no evidence \"that Dowling wrongfully came by the phonorecords actually shipped or the physical materials from which they were made.\" Dowling, supra at 214, 105 S.Ct. at 3132.\n\nJustice Blackmun felt compelled, however, to answer the government's argument that the unauthorized use of the underlying musical compositions was itself sufficient to render the offending phonorecords property \"stolen, converted or taken by fraud.\"\n\n[T]he Government's theory here would make theft, conversion, or fraud equivalent to wrongful appropriation of statutorily protected rights in copyright. The copyright owner, however, holds no ordinary chattel. A copyright, like other intellectual property, comprises a series of carefully defined and carefully delimited interests to which the law affords correspondingly exact protections. Id. at 216, 105 S.Ct. at 3133.\nA copyright, as Justice Blackmun explained, is unlike an ordinary chattel because the holder does not acquire exclusive dominion over the thing owned. The limited nature of the property interest conferred by copyright stems from an overriding First Amendment concern for the free dissemination of ideas. \"The primary objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of authors, but `[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.' Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8.\" Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340, 349, 111 S. Ct. 1282, 1294, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1991). Data General *538 Corp. v. Grumman Systems Support, 36 F.3d 1147, 1187 (1st Cir.1994) (same). Justice Blackmun offered the \"fair use\" doctrine (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107) and the statutory scheme of compulsory licensing of musical compositions (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 115) as examples of ways in which the property rights of a copyright holder are circumscribed by the Copyright Act.[3]Dowling, supra, 473 U.S. at 217, 105 S.Ct. at 3133.\n\nIt follows that interference with copyright does not easily equate with theft, conversion or fraud. The Copyright Act even employs a separate term of art to define one who misappropriates a copyright: \"Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner,\" that is, anyone who trespasses into his exclusive domain by using or authorizing the use of the copyrighted work in one of the five ways set forth in the statute, \"is an infringer of the copyright.\" There is no dispute in this case that Dowling's unauthorized inclusion on his bootleg albums of performances of copyrighted compositions constituted infringement of those copyrights. It is less clear, however, that the taking that occurs when an infringer arrogates the use of another's protected work comfortably fits the terms associated with physical removal employed by \u00a7 2314. The infringer invades a statutorily defined province guaranteed to the copyright holder alone. But he does not assume physical control over the copyright; nor does he wholly deprive its owner of its use. While one may colloquially like infringement with some general notion of wrongful appropriation, infringement plainly implicates a more complex set of property interests than does run-of-the-mill theft, conversion, or fraud. As a result, it fits but awkwardly with the language Congress chose \u0097 \"stolen, converted or taken by fraud\" \u0097 to describe the sorts of goods whose interstate shipment \u00a7 2314 makes criminal. Id. at 217-218, 105 S.Ct. at 3133 (citations omitted).\nThe ITSP statute, Justice Blackmun observed, had its roots in efforts by Congress to supplement the efforts of state authorities frustrated by jurisdictional problems arising from the transportation of stolen property across state lines. Id. at 219-220, 105 S.Ct. at 3134-3135.\n\nNo such need for supplemental federal action has ever existed, however, with respect to copyright infringement, for the obvious reason that Congress always has had the bestowed authority to legislate directly in this area.... Given that power, it is implausible to suppose that Congress intended to combat the problem of copyright infringement by the circuitous route hypothesized by the government.... In sum, the premise of \u00a7 2314 \u0097 the need to fill with federal action an enforcement chasm created by limited state jurisdiction \u0097 simply does not apply to the conduct the Government seeks to reach here. Id. at 220-221, 105 S.Ct. at 3135.\nA review of the evolution of criminal penalties in the Copyright Act led Justice Blackmun to observe that:\n\n\"[T]he history of the criminal infringement provisions of the Copyright Act reveals a good deal of care on Congress' part before subjecting copyright infringement to serious criminal penalties.... In stark contrast, the Government's theory of this case presupposes a congressional decision to bring the felony provisions of \u00a7 2314, which make available the comparatively light fine of not more than $10,000 but the relatively harsh term of imprisonment of up to 10 years, to bear on the distribution of a sufficient quantity of any infringing goods simply because of the presence here of a factor \u0097 interstate transportation \u0097 not otherwise though relevant to copyright law. The Government thereby presumes congressional adoption of an indirect but blunderbuss solution to a problem treated with precision when considered directly. Id. at 225-226, 105 S.Ct. at 3137.\nFinally, noting that the government's expansive reading of the Stolen Property Act would have the unsettling effect of criminalizing a broad range of conduct involving copyright and other intellectual property that had been historically regulated by the civil laws, *539 Justice Blackmun concluded that \"the deliberation with which Congress over the last decade has addressed the problem of copyright infringement for profit, as well as the precision with which it has chosen to apply criminal penalties in this area, demonstrates anew the wisdom of leaving it to the legislature to define crime and prescribe penalties. Here, the language of \u00a7 2314 does not `plainly and unmistakably' cover petitioner Dowling's conduct.\" Id. at 228, 105 S.Ct. at 3138-3139 (footnote omitted). Dowling's ITSP convictions were reversed.\n\nTHE COPYRIGHT LAW\n\nArticle I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power \"[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective writings and Discoveries.\" Thus \"[t]he remedies for infringement `are only those prescribed by Congress.'\" Sony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 431, 104 S. Ct. 774, 783, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1984) (quoting Thompson v. Hubbard, 131 U.S. 123, 151, 9 S. Ct. 710, 720, 33 L. Ed. 76 (1889)). Since 1897, when criminal copyright infringement was first introduced into U.S. copyright law,[4] the concept differentiating criminal from civil copyright violations has been that the infringement must be pursued for purposes of commercial exploitation.\n\nUntil 1909, \"[t]he crime of copyright infringement was ... limited to unlawful performances and representation of copyrighted dramatic and musical compositions.\" Saunders, Criminal Copyright Infringement and the Copyright Felony Act, 71 Denv.U.L.Rev. 671, 673 (1994). The 1897 Act defined the mens rea of criminal copyright infringement as conduct that is \"willfull\" and undertaken \"for profit,\" a definition that remained unaltered until the general revision of the Copyright Act in 1976.\n\nIn 1909, the Copyright Act was revised to extend misdemeanor criminal sanctions to infringement of all copyrighted material with the exception of sound recordings. Copyright Act of 1909, ch. 320, 33 Stat. 1075-1082. The 1909 amendments also made criminal the knowing and willful aiding and abetting of another's infringing activities. Performers and producers of musical recordings were not protected under the 1909 Act, and composers were given the exclusive rights to license only the first recording of their musical works. After that, a compulsory licensing provision allowed anyone to record and distribute the work so long as a two cent per copy royalty was paid to the original composer. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1(e), 25(e).\n\nThe framework set out by the 1909 Act remained in effect until 1971, when the growth of the recording industry following the musical revolution of the 1960's brought the problem of unauthorized reproduction and sale of musical works to Congress' attention. See H.R.Rep. No. 487, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1971). In response, Congress passed the Sound Recording Act of 1971, which addressed the perceived flaw in the 1909 Act by granting sound recordings full copyright protection, including criminal penalties for profit motivated infringement. In 1976, Congress revamped the Copyright Act by eliminating the crime of aiding and abetting copyright infringement. It also eased the mens rea requirement for criminal copyright infringement by eliminating the burden of proving that an infringer acted \"for profit,\" requiring instead only that the infringement be conducted \"willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a). Criminal infringement under the 1976 Act was a misdemeanor except in the case of repeat offenders (who could be sentenced to a maximum of two years and a fine of $50,000).\n\nAfter lobbying by the Motion Picture Association and the Recording Industry Association, Congress increased the penalties for criminal infringement in 1982. Act of May 24, 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-180, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., 96 Stat. 91. Certain types of first-time criminal infringement were punishable as felonies depending on the time period involved and the number of copies reproduced or distributed.[5]*540 See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2319. The mens rea element, however, remained unchanged, requiring proof of \"commercial advantage or private financial gain.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a). Most criminal infringements remained misdemeanor offenses despite the new penalty structure.\n\nIn the decade following the 1982 revisions to the Copyright Act, the home computing and software industry underwent a period of explosive growth paralleling the expansion in the 1960's and 1970's of the recording and motion picture industries. In 1992, the Software Publishers Association reported in testimony to the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration of the House Committee on the Judiciary that software manufacturers were losing $2.4 billion in revenues annually as a result of software piracy. \"Rather than adopting a piecemeal approach to copyright legislation and simply adding computer programs to audiovisual works, and sound recordings to the list of works whose infringement can give rise to felony penalties under [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2319,\" Congress passed the Copyright Felony Act.[6] Saunders, supra, at 680. The Act amended \u00a7 2319 by extending its felony provisions to the criminal infringement of all copyrighted works including computer software.[7] The mens rea for criminal infringement remained unchanged, requiring prosecutors to prove that the defendant infringed a copyright \"willfully and for purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain.\" 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a).[8]\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 was enacted in 1952. In its entirety, the statute reads as follows:\n\nWhoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. If the violation affects a financial institution, such person shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.\nThe wire fraud statute was enacted to cure a jurisdictional defect that Congress perceived was created by the growth of radio and television as commercial media. In its report to the House of Representatives, the Committee on the Judiciary explained:\n\n[T]he measure in amended form ... creates a new, but relatively isolated area of criminal conduct consisting of the execution of a scheme to defraud or to obtain money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises transmitted in writings, signs, pictures, or sounds via interstate wire or radio communications (which includes the medium of television).... The rapid growth of interstate communications facilities, *541 particularly those of radio and television, has given rise to a variety of fraudulent activities on the part of unscrupulous persons which are not within the reach of existing mail fraud laws, but which are carried out in complete reliance upon the use of wire and radio facilities and without resort to the mails.... Even in those cases of radio fraud where the mails have played a role, it is sometimes difficult to prove the use of the mails to the satisfaction of the court, and so prosecutions often fail. Because of the greater facility in proving the use of radio, this bill if enacted might often rescue a prosecution which would otherwise be defeated on technicalities.\nH.R.Rep. No. 388, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 102 (1951).\n\nAs the legislative history makes clear, the wire fraud statute was intended to complement the mail fraud statute by giving federal prosecutors jurisdiction over frauds involving the use of interstate (or foreign) wire transmissions.[9] Thus what can be prosecuted as a scheme to defraud under the mail fraud statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) is equally susceptible to punishment under \u00a7 1343 so long as the jurisdictional element is met. Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 25 n. 6, 108 S. Ct. 316, 320 n. 6, 98 L. Ed. 2d 275 (1987). McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. v. Heritage Travel, Inc., 904 F.2d 786, 791 n. 8 (1st Cir.1990). The concomitancy of the two statutes underlies the government's argument that significance should be read into the fact that the limited grant of certiorari in Dowling left Dowling's convictions for mail fraud undisturbed.\n\nA scheme to defraud is the defining concept of the mail and wire fraud statutes. Because of the conjunctive use of the word \"or\" in the statutory phrase \"any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises,\" the federal courts (encouraged by prosecutors) have essentially bifurcated mail and wire fraud into two separate offenses; the first, the devising of a scheme to defraud, the second, the devising of a scheme to obtain money or property by false pretenses. While the latter crime comports with common law notions of fraud, \"[t]he phrase, `a scheme to defraud' came to prohibit a plan, that is, to forbid a state of mind, rather than physical conduct.\" Moohr, Mail Fraud and the Intangible Rights Doctrine: Someone to Watch Over Us, 31 Harv.J. on Legis. 153, 161 (1994).\n\nThe incarnation of mail fraud as an inchoate crime has its most celebrated expression in federal prosecutions of state and local public officials accused of depriving citizens of their intangible right to honest public service in violation of their fiduciary duty to disclose conflicts of interest.[10] See United States v. Mandel, 591 F.2d 1347, 1360-1362 (4th Cir.1979). Because of the so-called \"intangible rights doctrine,\" mail fraud and its sister offense, wire fraud, have become the federal prosecutor's weapon of choice. \"Mail fraud ... has been expanded to the point that a fiduciary, agent, or employee commits an offense when, through a material deception or a failure to disclose a beneficiary, principal or employer suffers even an intangible, constructed detriment.\" Moohr, supra, 31 Harv.J. On Legis. at 163. Wire fraud offers an especially pleasing feature from the government's perspective that is particularly relevant to LaMacchia's case. Unlike the criminal copyright statute, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a), the mail and wire fraud statutes do not require that a defendant be shown to *542 have sought to personally profit from the scheme to defraud. See United States v. Silvano, 812 F.2d 754, 759-760 (1st Cir.1987).\n\nWhile it is true, as LaMacchia contends, that the denial of a writ of certiorari \"imports no expression upon the merits of the case,\" United States v. Carver, 260 U.S. 482, 490, 43 S. Ct. 181, 182, 67 L. Ed. 361 (1923), the more interesting issue is whether the Ninth Circuit's mail fraud analysis (the significant portions of which the Supreme Court left intact) is applicable to the facts of his case.\n\nDowling brought himself within the orbit of the mail fraud statute by mailing catalogues advertising his bootleg phonograph records. So, too, the government argues, LaMacchia subjected himself to the wire fraud statute by advertising infringing software via computer transmissions. The government in Dowling (as here) did not argue any more than jurisdictional significance for Dowling's mailings, that is, the mailings themselves did not make any false or misleading representations. They did, however, serve as an obvious means of furthering Dowling's scheme to defraud. See Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 710-711, 109 S. Ct. 1443, 1447-1448, 103 L. Ed. 2d 734 (1989).\n\nThe Ninth Circuit nonetheless focused on the fact that Dowling had \"concealed his activities from the copyright holders with the intent to deprive them of their royalties.\" United States v. Dowling, 739 F.2d 1445, 1449 (9th Cir.1984). \"It is settled in this Circuit that a scheme to defraud need not be an active misrepresentation. A nondisclosure or concealment may serve as a basis for the fraudulent scheme.\" Id. at 1448. See also United States v. Silvano, supra, 812 F.2d at 759 (same). The Ninth Circuit rejected Dowling's argument that non-disclosure can serve as the basis of a scheme to defraud only when a defendant has a fiduciary duty to make an affirmative disclosure. It also rejected the government's contention that \"the presence of illegal conduct alone may constitute the basis of the `fraud' element.\" 739 F.2d at 1449. \"Rather, we conclude that a non-disclosure can only serve as a basis for a fraudulent scheme when there exists an independent duty that has been breached by the person so charged.\" Id. This duty, the Ninth Circuit noted, could be fiduciary in nature, or it could \"derive from an independent explicit statutory duty created by legislative enactment.\" Id. In Dowling's case, the duty located by the Ninth Circuit was the duty implicit in the compulsory licensing scheme of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 115, which requires vendors to notify copyright owners of the intention to manufacture and distribute infringing records.\n\nIn conclusion, we stress that the narrowness of our holding permits nondisclosures to form the basis of a scheme to defraud only when there exists an independent duty (either fiduciary or derived from an explicit and independent statutory requirement) and such a duty has been breached. To hold otherwise that illegal conduct alone may constitute the basis of the fraud element of a mail fraud conviction would have the potential of bringing almost any illegal act within the province of the mail fraud statute.\n739 F.2d at 1450.\n\nThe difficulties in applying the Ninth Circuit's Dowling analysis to support a wire fraud prosecution in LaMacchia's case are three. First, no fiduciary relationship existed between LaMacchia and the manufacturers whose software copyrights he allegedly infringed. Second, there is no independent statutory duty of disclosure like the one that snared Dowling because there is no software equivalent to the compulsory licensing scheme.[11] Third, even were I to accept the argument made by the government in Dowling, that illegal conduct alone may suffice to satisfy the fraud element of [\u00a7 1343], the holding would not cover LaMacchia's case for the simple reason that what LaMacchia is *543 alleged to have done is not criminal conduct under \u00a7 506(a) of the Copyright Act.[12]\n\nThe government's second and more plausible argument relies on the unobjectionable proposition \"that [the] enactment of particularized federal interest statutes does not oust a more general interstate commerce statute from application.\" Government's Memorandum at 11. The government cites a number of areas of specialized federal law where the mail and wire fraud statutes have been held to remain viable enforcement tools. This same argument, however, did not impress Justice Blackmun in Dowling, as none of the cases cited there (as here) \"involved copyright law specifically or intellectual property in general.\" Dowling, supra, 473 U.S. at 218 n. 8, 105 S.Ct. at 3134 n. 8.[13] The government also points to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2319(a), which provides that \"[w]hoever violates section 506(a) ... of title 17 shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section and such penalties shall be in addition to any other provisions of title 17 or any other law.\" The government emphasizes the last four words of the statute without apparently noticing the first four. LaMacchia is not alleged to have violated section 506(a). See also Dowling, supra at 225 n. 18, 105 S.Ct. at 3137 n. 18 (\"In the absence of any such indication [that Congress intended to approve the use of \u00a7 2314 in a copyright prosecution], we decline to read the general language appended to \u00a7 2319(a) impliedly to validate extension of \u00a7 2314 in a manner otherwise unsupported by its language and purpose\"). Finally, the government cites Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19,  108 S. Ct. 316, 98 L. Ed. 2d 275 (1987), which holds that intangible as well as tangible property interests are protected by the mail and wire fraud statutes. \"Absolutely nothing in [Carpenter],\" the government argues, \"distinguishes intangible rights to copy, distribute and license computer software from other intangible property interests....\" Government's Memorandum at 13. But see United States v. Riggs, 739 F. Supp. 414, 422-423 (N.D.Ill.1990) (\"As Dowling ... recognized, the copyright holder owns only a bundle of intangible rights which can be infringed, but not stolen or converted. The owner of confidential, proprietary business information, in contrast, possesses something which has clearly been recognized as an item of property\").\n\nThe issue thus is whether the \"bundle of rights\" conferred by copyright is unique and distinguishable from the indisputably broad range of property interests protected by the mail and wire fraud statutes. I find it difficult, if not impossible, to read Dowling as saying anything but that it is.[14] \"A copyright, like other intellectual property, comprises a series of carefully defined and carefully delimited interests to which the law affords correspondingly exact protections.\" Dowling, supra 473 U.S. at 216, 105 S.Ct. at 3133. If, as the government contends, Dowling stands for nothing more than the proposition that one cannot equate copyright infringement with a \"physical taking\" for purposes of the Stolen Property Act,[15] it is difficult to explain why Justice Blackmun devoted *544 the bulk of his opinion to the issue of \"whether the history and purpose of \u00a7 2314 evince a plain congressional intention to reach interstate shipments of goods infringing copyrights.\" Dowling, supra at 218, 105 S.Ct. at 3134.[16] Nor can one explain why the same analysis should not be applied to the mail and wire fraud statutes, which like the Stolen Property Act, were enacted to fill enforcement gaps in state and federal law. Why is it not true of mail and wire fraud, as it is of ITSP, that \"[n]o such need for supplemental federal action has ever existed ..., for the obvious reason that Congress always has had the bestowed authority to legislate directly in this area [of copyright infringement]\"? Dowling, supra at 220, 105 S.Ct. at 3135. Finally, why would not the government's position here produce the same pernicious result that Justice Blackmun warned of in Dowling, of permitting the government to subvert the carefully calculated penalties of the Copyright Act by selectively bringing some prosecutions under the more generous penalties of the mail and wire fraud statutes?[17]\n\nWhat the government is seeking to do is to punish conduct that reasonable people might agree deserves the sanctions of the criminal law. But as Justice Blackmun observed in Dowling, copyright is an area in which Congress has chosen to tread cautiously, relying \"chiefly ... on an array of civil remedies to provide copyright holders protection against infringement,\" while mandating \"studiously graded penalties\" in those instances where Congress has concluded that the deterrent effect of criminal sanctions are required. Dowling, supra at 221, 225, 105 S.Ct. at 3135, 3137. \"This step-by-step, carefully considered approach is consistent with Congress' traditional sensitivity to the special concerns implicated by the copyright laws.\" Id. at 225, 105 S.Ct. at 3137. Indeed, the responsiveness of Congress to the impact of new technology on the law of copyright, limned earlier in this opinion, confirms Justice Blackmun's conviction of \"the wisdom of leaving it to the legislature to define crime and prescribe penalties.\" Dowling, supra at 228, 105 S.Ct. at 3138.\n\n\"The judiciary's reluctance to expand the protections afforded by the copyright without explicit legislative guidance is a recurring theme. Sound policy, as well as history, supports our consistent deference to Congress when major technological innovations alter the market for copyrighted materials. Congress has the institutional authority and the institutional ability to accommodate fully the varied permutations of competing interests that are inevitably implicated by such new technology.\"\nSony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 431, 104 S. Ct. 774, 783, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574 (1984) (citations omitted).\n\nWhile the government's objective is a laudable one, particularly when the facts alleged in this case are considered, its interpretation of the wire fraud statute would serve to criminalize the conduct of not only persons like LaMacchia, but also the myriad of home computer users who succumb to the temptation to copy even a single software program for private use. It is not clear that making criminals of a large number of consumers of computer software is a result that even the software industry would consider desirable.[18]\n\n*545 In sum, I agree with Professor Nimmer that:\n\nThe Dowling decision establishes that Congress has finely calibrated the reach of criminal liability [in the Copyright Act], and therefore absent clear indication of Congressional intent, the criminal laws of the United States do not reach copyright-related conduct. Thus copyright prosecutions should be limited to Section 506 of the Act, and other incidental statutes that explicitly refer to copyright and copyrighted works.\n3 Nimmer on Copyright, \u00a7 15.05 at 15-20 (1993). See also 2 Goldstein, Copyright, \u00a7 11.4.2.2, at 304 n. 67 (1989) (\"[A]lthough the Court did not directly rule on whether the mail fraud statute encompassed the infringing conduct, its reasoning with respect to the Stolen Property Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314, suggests that it would have treated the mail fraud statute similarly.\")\n\nAccordingly, I rule that the decision of the Supreme Court in Dowling v. United States precludes LaMacchia's prosecution for criminal copyright infringement under the wire fraud statute.[19]\n\nThis is not, of course, to suggest that there is anything edifying about what LaMacchia is alleged to have done. If the indictment is to be believed, one might at best describe his actions as heedlessly irresponsible, and at worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking in any fundamental sense of values. Criminal as well as civil penalties should probably attach to willful, multiple infringements of copyrighted software even absent a commercial motive on the part of the infringer. One can envision ways that the copyright law could be modified to permit such prosecution. But, \"`[i]t is the legislature, not the Court which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment.'\" Dowling, supra, 473 U.S. at 214, 105 S.Ct. at 3131 (quoting United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95, 5 L. Ed. 37 (1820)).\n\nORDER\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, defendant LaMacchia's motion to dismiss is ALLOWED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] The allusion is presumably to the North Star, a faithful astronomical reference point for mariners.\n\n[2] The Court observed a split among the Circuits concerning the applicability of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 to the interstate transportation of infringing articles.\n\n[3] Another example is the finite duration of a copyright. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 302.\n\n[4] Act of January 6, 1897, ch. 4, 29 Stat. 481-482.\n\n[5] While the offense of criminal copyright infringement remained defined by 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a), the penalties were moved to a new freestanding statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2319.\n\n[6] Pub.L. No. 102-561 [S. 893] (October 28, 1992) (enacted after amendment). This is not to say that Congress had been inattentive to the needs of the emerging software industry. In 1980, Congress added \"computer program\" to the list of definitions of works protected under the copyright statute. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. The Computer Software Rental Amendments Act of 1990 gave further protection to holders of software copyrights, although declining to subject violators to the criminal penalties of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 506 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2319. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 109(b)(4).\n\n[7] The Report that accompanied the Senate version of the bill declared that \"[t]he only defense against [software] piracy is the copyright law.\" S.Rep. No. 268, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992) (emphasis added).\n\n[8] As Senator Hatch, the Senate sponsor of the Act noted, \"the copying must be undertaken to make money, and even incidental financial benefits that might accrue as a result of the copying should not contravene the law where the achievement of those benefits [was] not the motivation behind the copying.\" 138 Cong.Rec. S. 17958-17959 (October 8, 1992).\n\n[9] The \"interstate\" limitation was inserted into the statute both out of jurisdictional concerns and to \"avoid intrusion on the police power of the States.\" H.R.Rep. No. 388, supra, at 3. The police power of the States, of course, does not extend to the regulation of copyright, leading one to doubt, as defendant points out, that the statute was enacted to supplement state efforts to police copyright infringement. Defendant's Memorandum, at 18.\n\n[10] The origins and contours of the intangible rights doctrine (and the short-lived effort of the Supreme Court to reground the mail fraud statute in traditional concepts of property, see McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292 (1987)) are capably portrayed in Moohr, supra, 31 Harv.J. on Legis. at 158-170. The doctrine has been applied with similar effect to schemes arising in a commercial context. See United States v. George, 477 F.2d 508 (7th Cir.1973) (commercial kickbacks, employee's duty to disclose).\n\n[11] In Cooper v. United States, 639 F. Supp. 176, 180 (M.D.Fla.1986), cited by the government, the petitioners did not raise the sufficiency of the allegation of a scheme to defraud, but rather the possibility that the jury might have perceived the interstate transportation of the pirated cassette tapes as the gravamen of the scheme, a theory indisputably precluded by the Supreme Court's Dowling decision.\n\n[12] I do not believe that the Ninth Circuit's mail fraud analysis survives Dowling in any event, as I will explain. Dowling, I note, did not contest his conviction for criminal violations of \u00a7 506(a) of the Copyright Act.\n\n[13] The suggestion that the felony provisions of the wire fraud statute were enacted with the punishment of copyright infringement in mind is somewhat difficult to accept when one remembers that in 1952 the Copyright Act authorized only misdemeanor prosecutions, a circumstance that continued until 1982. Equally difficult to accept is the idea that Congress has in some fashion acquiesced by silence to the utilization of mail and wire fraud as copyright enforcement tools. One need only contrast the infrequent and, with exception of the Congressional reaction to McNally, technical amendments to the mail and wire fraud statutes with Congress' exhaustive attention to developments affecting copyright law.\n\n[14] The government strenuously disagrees with me on this point. However, even the dissenters in Dowling (Justice Powell and White) saw the issue framed by the majority no differently than I do. As Justice Powell characterizes the opinion: \"The Court holds today that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 does not apply to this case because the rights of a copyright holder are `different' from the rights of owners of other kinds of property.\" Dowling, supra at 229, 105 S.Ct. at 3139 (Powell, J., dissenting).\n\n[15] See Government's Memorandum at 8.\n\n[16] The government's suggestion \"that the legislative history of copyright protection serves only to provide `additional reason to hesitate before extending \u00a7 2314 to cover the interstate shipments in this case',\" and that Dowling simply held that \"`Congress has not spoken with the requisite clarity,'\" seem to me equally applicable to the analysis of \u00a7 1343. Government's Memorandum at 8 (quoting Dowling, supra at 221, 229, 105 S.Ct. at 3135, 3139).\n\n[17] For example, a first offender who reproduces fewer than ten copies of a computer software program in a one hundred and eighty day period is subject to a maximum punishment of one year imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314(b)(3). The same prosecution under the wire fraud statute would entail a maximum prison sentence of five years. As defendant also notes, use of the wire fraud statute to punish criminal copyright infringement would override the shorter three year statute of limitations of the Copyright Act.\n\n[18] In 1992, in hearings before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration, the Vice-President and General Counsel of the Computer & Communications Industry Association testified as follows: \"There are millions of people with personal computers to make copies. That is exactly one of the reasons I think you want to be very careful. You do not want to be accidentally taking a large percentage of the American people, either small business or citizens, into the gray area of criminal law.\" Hearing on S. 893 (August 12, 1992) at p. 65.\n\n[19] The issue presented in this case is one of infringement only. Infringement is a technical concept describing interference with the statutorily defined rights of a copyright holder. A scheme or artifice to defraud, the object of which was to fraudulently obtain possession of the copyright itself would, I believe, be clearly punishable under the mail and wire fraud statutes. See Dowling, supra, 473 U.S. at 217, 105 S.Ct. at 3133 (\"[The infringer] does not assume physical control over the copyright, nor does he wholly deprive the owner of its use\").", "annotations":

v. TAM, (2017)\nNo. 15-1293\nArgued: January 18, 2017    Decided: June 19, 2017\nSimon Tam, lead singer of the rock group \"The Slants,\" chose this moniker in order to \"reclaim\" the term and drain its denigrating force as a derogatory term for Asian persons. Tam sought federal registration of the mark \"THE SLANTS.\" The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) denied the application under a Lanham Act provision prohibiting the registration of trademarks that may \"disparage . . . or bring . . . into contemp[t] or disrepute\" any \"persons, living or dead.\" 15 U. S. C. \u00a71052(a). Tam contested the denial of registration through the administrative appeals process, to no avail. He then took the case to federal court, where the en banc Federal Circuit ultimately found the disparagement clause facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause.\n\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n\n808 F. 3d 1321, affirmed.\n\n     JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III-A, concluding:\n\n     1. The disparagement clause applies to marks that disparage the members of a racial or ethnic group. Tam's view, that the clause applies only to natural or juristic persons, is refuted by the plain terms of the clause, which uses the word \"persons.\" A mark that disparages a \"substantial\" percentage of the members of a racial or ethnic group necessarily disparages many \"persons,\" namely, members of that group. Tam's narrow reading also clashes with the breadth of the disparagement clause, which by its terms applies not just to \"persons,\" but also to \"institutions\" and \"beliefs.\" \u00a71052(a). Had Congress wanted to confine the reach of the clause, it could have used the phrase \"particular living individual,\" which it used in neighboring \u00a71052(c). Tam contends that his interpretation is supported by legislative history and by the PTO's practice for many years of registering marks that plainly denigrated certain groups. But an inquiry into the meaning of the statute's text ceases when, as here, \"the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.\" Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 450 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even if resort to legislative history and early enforcement practice were appropriate, Tam has presented nothing showing a congressional intent to adopt his interpretation, and the PTO's practice in the years following the disparagement clause's enactment is unenlightening. Pp. 8-12.\n\n     2. The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. Contrary to the Government's contention, trademarks are private, not government speech. Because the \"Free Speech Clause . . . does not regulate government speech,\" Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460, 467, the government is not required to maintain viewpoint neutrality on its own speech. This Court exercises great caution in extending its government-speech precedents, for if private speech could be passed off as government speech by simply affixing a government seal of approval, government could silence or muffle the expression of disfavored viewpoints.\n\n     The Federal Government does not dream up the trademarks registered by the PTO. Except as required by \u00a71052(a), an examiner may not reject a mark based on the viewpoint that it appears to express. If the mark meets the Lanham Act's viewpoint-neutral requirements, registration is mandatory. And once a mark is registered, the PTO is not authorized to remove it from the register unless a party moves for cancellation, the registration expires, or the Federal Trade Commission initiates proceedings based on certain grounds. It is thus far-fetched to suggest that the content of a registered mark is government speech, especially given the fact that if trademarks become government speech when they are registered, the Federal Government is babbling prodigiously and incoherently. And none of this Court's government-speech cases supports the idea that registered trademarks are government speech. Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn., 544 U. S. 550; Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460; and Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., 576 U. S. ___, distinguished. Holding that the registration of a trademark converts the mark into government speech would constitute a huge and dangerous extension of the government-speech doctrine, for other systems of government registration (such as copyright) could easily be characterized in the same way. Pp. 12-18.\n\n     JUSTICE ALITO, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE BREYER, concluded in Parts III-B, III-C, and IV:\n\n     (a) The Government's argument that this case is governed by the Court's subsidized-speech cases is unpersuasive. Those cases all involved cash subsidies or their equivalent, e.g., funds to private parties for family planning services in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, and cash grants to artists in National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569. The federal registration of a trademark is nothing like these programs. The PTO does not pay money to parties seeking registration of a mark; it requires the payment of fees to file an application and to maintain the registration once it is granted. The Government responds that registration provides valuable non-monetary benefits traceable to the Government's resources devoted to registering the marks, but nearly every government service requires the expenditure of government funds. This is true of services that benefit everyone, like police and fire protection, as well as services that are utilized by only some, e.g., the adjudication of private lawsuits and the use of public parks and highways. Pp. 18-20.\n\n     (b) Also unpersuasive is the Government's claim that the disparagement clause is constitutional under a \"government-program\" doctrine, an argument which is based on a merger of this Court's government-speech cases and subsidy cases. It points to two cases involving a public employer's collection of union dues from its employees, Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177, and Ysursa v. Pocatello Ed. Assn., 555 U. S. 353, but these cases occupy a special area of First Amendment case law that is far removed from the registration of trademarks. Cases in which government creates a limited public forum for private speech, thus allowing for some content- and speaker-based restrictions, see, e.g., Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106-107; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 831, are potentially more analogous. But even in those cases, viewpoint discrimination is forbidden. The disparagement clause denies registration to any mark that is offensive to a substantial percentage of the members of any group. That is viewpoint discrimination in the sense relevant here: Giving offense is a viewpoint. The \"public expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers.\" Street v. New York, 394 U. S. 576, 592. Pp. 20-23.\n\n     (c) The dispute between the parties over whether trademarks are commercial speech subject to the relaxed scrutiny outlined in Central Hudson Gas & Elect. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, need not be resolved here because the disparagement clause cannot withstand even Central Hudson review. Under Central Hudson, a restriction of speech must serve \"a substantial interest\" and be \"narrowly drawn.\" Id., at 564-565 (internal quotation marks omitted). One purported interest is in preventing speech expressing ideas that offend, but that idea strikes at the heart of the First Amendment. The second interest asserted is protecting the orderly flow of commerce from disruption caused by trademarks that support invidious discrimination; but the clause, which reaches any trademark that disparages any person, group, or institution, is not narrowly drawn. Pp.  23-26.\n\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN, agreed that 15 U. S. C. \u00a71052(a) constitutes viewpoint discrimination, concluding:\n\n     (a) With few narrow exceptions, a fundamental principle of the First Amendment is that the government may not punish or suppress speech based on disapproval of the ideas or perspectives the speech conveys. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 828-829. The test for viewpoint discrimination is whether--within the relevant subject category--the government has singled out a subset of messages for disfavor based on the views expressed. Here, the disparagement clause identifies the relevant subject as \"persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols,\" \u00a71052(a); and within that category, an applicant may register a positive or benign mark but not a derogatory one. The law thus reflects the Government's disapproval of a subset of messages it finds offensive, the essence of viewpoint discrimination. The Government's arguments in defense of the statute are unpersuasive. Pp. 2-5.\n\n     (b) Regardless of whether trademarks are commercial speech, the viewpoint based discrimination here necessarily invokes heightened scrutiny. See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U. S. 552, 566. To the extent trademarks qualify as commercial speech, they are an example of why that category does not serve as a blanket exemption from the First Amendment's requirement of viewpoint neutrality. In the realm of trademarks, the metaphorical marketplace of ideas becomes a tangible, powerful reality. To permit viewpoint discrimination in this context is to permit Government censorship.

SIMON SHIAO TAM\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n[June 19, 2017]\n\n     JUSTICE ALITO announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III-A, and an opinion with respect to Parts III-B, III-C, and IV, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE THOMAS, and JUSTICE BREYER join.\n\n     This case concerns a dance-rock band's application for federal trademark registration of the band's name, \"The Slants.\" \"Slants\" is a derogatory term for persons of Asian descent, and members of the band are Asian-Americans. But the band members believe that by taking that slur as the name of their group, they will help to \"reclaim\" the term and drain its denigrating force.\n\n     The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) denied the application based on a provision of federal law prohibiting the registration of trademarks that may \"disparage . . . or bring . . . into contemp[t] or disrepute\" any \"persons, living or dead.\" 15 U. S. C. \u00a71052(a). We now hold that this provision violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. It offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend.\n\nI\n\nA\n\n     \"The principle underlying trademark protection is that distinctive marks--words, names, symbols, and the like--can help distinguish a particular artisan's goods from those of others.\" B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 3); see also Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers, Inc., 529 U. S. 205, 212 (2000). A trademark \"designate[s] the goods as the product of a particular trader\" and \"protect[s] his good will against the sale of another's product as his.\" United Drug Co. v. Theodore Rectanus Co., 248 U. S. 90, 97 (1918); see also Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, 240 U. S. 403, 412-413 (1916). It helps consumers identify goods and services that they wish to purchase, as well as those they want to avoid. See Wal-Mart Stores, supra, at 212-213; Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U. S. 189, 198 (1985).\n\n     \"[F]ederal law does not create trademarks.\" B&B Hardware, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3). Trademarks and their precursors have ancient origins, and trademarks were protected at common law and in equity at the time of the founding of our country. 3 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a719:8 (4th ed. 2017) (hereinafter McCarthy); 1 id., \u00a7\u00a75:1, 5:2, 5:3; Pattishal, The Constitutional Foundations of American Trademark Law, 78 Trademark Rep. 456, 457-458 (1988); Pattishall, Two Hundred Years of American Trademark Law, 68 Trademark Rep. 121, 121-123 (1978); see Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 92 (1879). For most of the 19th century, trademark protection was the province of the States. See Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U. S. 763, 780-782 (1992) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 785 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). Eventually, Congress stepped in to provide a degree of national uniformity, passing the first federal legislation protecting trademarks in 1870. See Act of July 8, 1870, \u00a7\u00a777-84, 16 Stat. 210-212. The foundation of current federal trademark law is the Lanham Act, enacted in 1946. See Act of July 5, 1946, ch. 540, 60 Stat. 427. By that time, trademark had expanded far beyond phrases that do no more than identify a good or service. Then, as now, trademarks often consisted of catchy phrases that convey a message.\n\n     Under the Lanham Act, trademarks that are \"used in commerce\" may be placed on the \"principal register,\" that is, they may be federally registered. 15 U. S. C. \u00a71051(a)(1). And some marks \"capable of distinguishing [an] applicant's goods or services and not registrable on the principal register . . . which are in lawful use in commerce by the owner thereof\" may instead be placed on a different federal register: the supplemental register. \u00a71091(a). There are now more than two million marks that have active federal certificates of registration. PTO Performance and Accountability Report, Fiscal Year 2016, p. 192 (Table 15), https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/ documents/USPTOFY16PAR.pdf (all Internet materials as last visited June 16, 2017). This system of federal registration helps to ensure that trademarks are fully protected and supports the free flow of commerce. \"[N]ational protection of trademarks is desirable,\" we have explained, \"because trademarks foster competition and the maintenance of quality by securing to the producer the benefits of good reputation.\" San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U. S. 522, 531 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Park 'N Fly, Inc., supra, at 198 (\"The Lanham Act provides national protection of trademarks in order to secure to the owner of the mark the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers\").\n\nB\n\n     Without federal registration, a valid trademark may still be used in commerce. See 3 McCarthy \u00a719:8. And an unregistered trademark can be enforced against would-be infringers in several ways. Most important, even if a trademark is not federally registered, it may still be enforceable under \u00a743(a) of the Lanham Act, which creates a federal cause of action for trademark infringement. See Two Pesos, supra, at 768 (\"Section 43(a) prohibits a broader range of practices than does \u00a732, which applies to registered marks, but it is common ground that \u00a743(a) protects qualifying unregistered trademarks\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).1 Unregistered trademarks may also be entitled to protection under other federal statutes, such as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71125(d). See 5 McCarthy \u00a725A:49, at 25A-198 (\"[T]here is no requirement [in the Anticybersquatting Act] that the protected 'mark' be registered: unregistered common law marks are protected by the Act\"). And an unregistered trademark can be enforced under state common law, or if it has been registered in a State, under that State's registration system. See 3 id., \u00a719:3, at 19-23 (explaining that \"[t]he federal system of registration and protection does not preempt parallel state law protection, either by state common law or state registration\" and \"[i]n the vast majority of situations, federal and state trademark law peacefully coexist\"); id., \u00a722:1 (discussing state trademark registration systems).\n\n     Federal registration, however, \"confers important legal rights and benefits on trademark owners who register their marks.\" B&B Hardware, 575 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). Registration on the principal register (1) \"serves as 'constructive notice of the registrant's claim of ownership' of the mark,\" ibid. (quoting 15 U. S. C. \u00a71072); (2) \"is 'prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of the owner's ownership of the mark, and of the owner's exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services specified in the certificate,' \" B & B Hardware, 575 U. S. ___ (slip op., at 3) (quoting \u00a71057(b)); and (3) can make a mark \" 'incontestable' \" once a mark has been registered for five years,\" ibid. (quoting \u00a7\u00a71065, 1115(b)); see Park 'N Fly, 469 U. S., at 193. Registration also enables the trademark holder \"to stop the importation into the United States of articles bearing an infringing mark.\" 3 McCarthy \u00a719:9, at 19-38; see 15 U. S. C. \u00a71124.\n\nC\n\n     The Lanham Act contains provisions that bar certain trademarks from the principal register. For example, a trademark cannot be registered if it is \"merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive\" of goods, \u00a71052(e)(1), or if it is so similar to an already registered trademark or trade name that it is \"likely . . . to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive,\" \u00a71052(d).\n\n     At issue in this case is one such provision, which we will call \"the disparagement clause.\" This provision prohibits the registration of a trademark \"which may disparage . . . persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute.\" \u00a71052(a).2 This clause appeared in the original Lanham Act and has remained the same to this day. See \u00a72(a), 60 Stat. 428.\n\n     When deciding whether a trademark is disparaging, an examiner at the PTO generally applies a \"two-part test.\" The examiner first considers \"the likely meaning of the matter in question, taking into account not only dictionary definitions, but also the relationship of the matter to the other elements in the mark, the nature of the goods or services, and the manner in which the mark is used in the marketplace in connection with the goods or services.\" Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure \u00a71203.03(b)(i) (Apr. 2017), p. 1200-150, http://tmep.uspto.gov. \"If that meaning is found to refer to identifiable persons, institutions, beliefs or national symbols,\" the examiner moves to the second step, asking \"whether that meaning may be disparaging to a substantial composite3 of the referenced group.\" Ibid. If the examiner finds that a \"substantial composite, although not necessarily a majority, of the referenced group would find the proposed mark . . . to be disparaging in the context of contemporary attitudes,\" a prima facie case of disparagement is made out, and the burden shifts to the applicant to prove that the trademark is not disparaging. Ibid. What is more, the PTO has specified that \"[t]he fact that an applicant may be a member of that group or has good intentions underlying its use of a term does not obviate the fact that a substantial composite of the referenced group would find the term objectionable.\" Ibid.\n\nD\n\n     Simon Tam is the lead singer of \"The Slants.\" In re Tam, 808 F. 3d 1321, 1331 (CA Fed. 2015) (en banc), as corrected (Feb. 11, 2016). He chose this moniker in order to \"reclaim\" and \"take ownership\" of stereotypes about people of Asian ethnicity. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The group \"draws inspiration for its lyrics from childhood slurs and mocking nursery rhymes\" and has given its albums names such as \"The Yellow Album\" and \"Slanted Eyes, Slanted Hearts.\" Ibid.\n\n     Tam sought federal registration of \"THE SLANTS,\" on the principal register, App. 17, but an examining attorney at the PTO rejected the request, applying the PTO's two-part framework and finding that \"there is . . . a substantial composite of persons who find the term in the applied-for mark offensive.\" Id., at 30. The examining attorney relied in part on the fact that \"numerous dictionaries define 'slants' or 'slant-eyes' as a derogatory or offensive term.\" Id., at 29. The examining attorney also relied on a finding that \"the band's name has been found offensive numerous times\"--citing a performance that was canceled because of the band's moniker and the fact that \"several bloggers and commenters to articles on the band have indicated that they find the term and the applied-for mark offensive.\" Id., at 29-30.\n\n     Tam contested the denial of registration before the examining attorney and before the PTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) but to no avail. Eventually, he took the case to federal court, where the en banc Federal Circuit ultimately found the disparagement clause facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. The majority found that the clause engages in viewpoint-based discrimination, that the clause regulates the expressive component of trademarks and consequently cannot be treated as commercial speech, and that the clause is subject to and cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. See 808 F. 3d, at 1334-1339. The majority also rejected the Government's argument that registered trademarks constitute government speech, as well as the Government's contention that federal registration is a form of government subsidy. See id., at 1339-1355. And the majority opined that even if the disparagement clause were analyzed under this Court's commercial speech cases, the clause would fail the \"intermediate scrutiny\" that those cases prescribe. See id., at 1355-1357.\n\n     Several judges wrote separately, advancing an assortment of theories. Concurring, Judge O'Malley agreed with the majority's reasoning but added that the disparagement clause is unconstitutionally vague. See id., at 1358-1363. Judge Dyk concurred in part and dissented in part. He argued that trademark registration is a government subsidy and that the disparagement clause is facially constitutional, but he found the clause unconstitutional as applied to THE SLANTS because that mark constitutes \"core expression\" and was not adopted for the purpose of disparaging Asian-Americans. See id., at 1363-1374. In dissent, Judge Lourie agreed with Judge Dyk that the clause is facially constitutional but concluded for a variety of reasons that it is also constitutional as applied in this case. See id., at 1374-1376. Judge Reyna also dissented, maintaining that trademarks are commercial speech and that the disparagement clause survives intermediate scrutiny because it \"directly advances the government's substantial interest in the orderly flow of commerce.\" See id., at 1376-1382.\n\n     The Government filed a petition for certiorari, which we granted in order to decide whether the disparagement clause \"is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.\" Pet. for Cert. i; see sub. nom. Lee v. Tam, 579 U. S. ___ (2016).\n\nII\n\n     Before reaching the question whether the disparagement clause violates the First Amendment, we consider Tam's argument that the clause does not reach marks that disparage racial or ethnic groups. The clause prohibits the registration of marks that disparage \"persons,\" and Tam claims that the term \"persons\" \"includes only natural and juristic persons,\" not \"non-juristic entities such as racial and ethnic groups.\" Brief for Respondent 46.\n\n     Tam never raised this argument before the PTO or the Federal Circuit, and we declined to grant certiorari on this question when Tam asked us to do so, see Brief Responding to Petition for Certiorari, pp. i, 17-21. Normally, that would be the end of the matter in this Court. See, e.g., Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 534-538 (1992); Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 894-895 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n\n      But as the Government pointed out in connection with its petition for certiorari, accepting Tam's statutory interpretation would resolve this case and leave the First Amendment question for another day. See Reply Brief 9. \"[W]e have often stressed\" that it is \"importan[t] [to] avoid[d] the premature adjudication of constitutional questions,\" Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 690 (1997), and that \"we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality . . . unless such adjudication is unavoidable,\" Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin, 323 U. S. 101, 105 (1944). See also Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U. S. 450, 461 (1945); Burton v. United States, 196 U. S. 283, 295 (1905). We thus begin by explaining why Tam's argument about the definition of \"persons\" in the Lanham Act is meritless.\n\n     As noted, the disparagement clause prohibits the registration of trademarks \"which may disparage . . . persons, living or dead.\" 15 U. S. C. \u00a71052(a). Tam points to a definition of \"person\" in the Lanham Act, which provides that \"[i]n the construction of this chapter, unless the contrary is plainly apparent from the context . . . [t]he term 'person' and any other word or term used to designate the applicant or other entitled to a benefit or privilege or rendered liable under the provisions of this chapter includes a juristic person as well as a natural person.\" \u00a71127. Because racial and ethnic groups are neither natural nor \"juristic\" persons, Tam asserts, these groups fall outside this definition. Brief for Respondent 46-48.\n\n     Tam's argument is refuted by the plain terms of the disparagement clause. The clause applies to marks that disparage \"persons.\" A mark that disparages a \"substantial\" percentage of the members of a racial or ethnic group, Trademark Manual \u00a71203.03(b)(i), at 1200-150, necessarily disparages many \"persons,\" namely, members of that group. Tam's argument would fail even if the clause used the singular term \"person,\" but Congress' use of the plural \"persons\" makes the point doubly clear.4\n\n     Tam's narrow reading of the term \"persons\" also clashes with the breadth of the disparagement clause. By its terms, the clause applies to marks that disparage, not just \"persons,\" but also \"institutions\" and \"beliefs.\" 15 U. S. C. \u00a71052(a). It thus applies to the members of any group whose members share particular \"beliefs,\" such as political, ideological, and religious groups. It applies to marks that denigrate \"institutions,\" and on Tam's reading, it also reaches \"juristic\" persons such as corporations, unions, and other unincorporated associations. See \u00a71127. Thus, the clause is not limited to marks that disparage a particular natural person. If Congress had wanted to confine the reach of the disparagement clause in the way that Tam suggests, it would have been easy to do so. A neighboring provision of the Lanham Act denies registration to any trademark that \"[c]onsists of or comprises a name, portrait, or signature identifying a particular living individual except by his written consent.\" \u00a71052(c) (emphasis added).\n\n     Tam contends that his interpretation of the disparagement clause is supported by its legislative history and by the PTO's willingness for many years to register marks that plainly denigrated African-Americans and Native Americans. These arguments are unpersuasive. As always, our inquiry into the meaning of the statute's text ceases when \"the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.\" Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 450 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, it is clear that the prohibition against registering trademarks \"which may disparage . . . persons,\" \u00a71052(a), prohibits registration of terms that disparage persons who share a common race or ethnicity.\n\n     Even if resort to legislative history and early enforcement practice were appropriate, we would find Tam's arguments unconvincing. Tam has not brought to our attention any evidence in the legislative history showing that Congress meant to adopt his interpretation. And the practice of the PTO in the years following the enactment of the disparagement clause is unenlightening. The admitted vagueness of the disparagement test5 and the huge volume of applications have produced a haphazard record of enforcement. (Even today, the principal register is replete with marks that many would regard as disparaging to racial and ethnic groups.6) Registration of the offensive marks that Tam cites is likely attributable not to the acceptance of his interpretation of the clause but to other factors--most likely the regrettable attitudes and sensibilities of the time in question.\n\nIII\n\n     Because the disparagement clause applies to marks that disparage the members of a racial or ethnic group, we must decide whether the clause violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. And at the outset, we must consider three arguments that would either eliminate any First Amendment protection or result in highly permissive rational-basis review. Specifically, the Government contends (1) that trademarks are government speech, not private speech, (2) that trademarks are a form of government subsidy, and (3) that the constitutionality of the disparagement clause should be tested under a new \"government-program\" doctrine. We address each of these arguments below.\n\nA\n\n     The First Amendment prohibits Congress and other government entities and actors from \"abridging the freedom of speech\"; the First Amendment does not say that Congress and other government entities must abridge their own ability to speak freely. And our cases recognize that \"[t]he Free Speech Clause . . . does not regulate government speech.\" Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460, 467 (2009); see Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn., 544 U. S. 550, 553 (2005) (\"[T]he Government's own speech . . . is exempt from First Amendment scrutiny\"); Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 235 (2000).\n\n     As we have said, \"it is not easy to imagine how government could function\" if it were subject to the restrictions that the First Amendment imposes on private speech. Summum, supra, at 468; see Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., 576 U. S. ___, ___-___ (2015) (slip op., at 5-7). \" '[T]he First Amendment forbids the government to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas at the expense of others,' \" Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 394 (1993), but imposing a requirement of viewpoint-neutrality on government speech would be paralyzing. When a government entity embarks on a course of action, it necessarily takes a particular viewpoint and rejects others. The Free Speech Clause does not require government to maintain viewpoint neutrality when its officers and employees speak about that venture.\n\n     Here is a simple example. During the Second World War, the Federal Government produced and distributed millions of posters to promote the war effort.7 There were posters urging enlistment, the purchase of war bonds, and the conservation of scarce resources.8 These posters expressed a viewpoint, but the First Amendment did not demand that the Government balance the message of these posters by producing and distributing posters encouraging Americans to refrain from engaging in these activities.\n\n     But while the government-speech doctrine is important--indeed, essential--it is a doctrine that is susceptible to dangerous misuse. If private speech could be passed off as government speech by simply affixing a government seal of approval, government could silence or muffle the expression of disfavored viewpoints. For this reason, we must exercise great caution before extending our government-speech precedents.\n\n     At issue here is the content of trademarks that are registered by the PTO, an arm of the Federal Government. The Federal Government does not dream up these marks, and it does not edit marks submitted for registration. Except as required by the statute involved here, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71052(a), an examiner may not reject a mark based on the viewpoint that it appears to express. Thus, unless that section is thought to apply, an examiner does not inquire whether any viewpoint conveyed by a mark is consistent with Government policy or whether any such viewpoint is consistent with that expressed by other marks already on the principal register. Instead, if the mark meets the Lanham Act's viewpoint-neutral requirements, registration is mandatory. Ibid. (requiring that \"[n]o trademark . . . shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless\" it falls within an enumerated statutory exception). And if an examiner finds that a mark is eligible for placement on the principal register, that decision is not reviewed by any higher official unless the registration is challenged. See \u00a7\u00a71062(a), 1071; 37 CFR \u00a741.31(a) (2016). Moreover, once a mark is registered, the PTO is not authorized to remove it from the register unless a party moves for cancellation, the registration expires, or the Federal Trade Commission initiates proceedings based on certain grounds. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71058(a), 1059, 1064; 37 CFR \u00a7\u00a72.111(b), 2.160.\n\n     In light of all this, it is far-fetched to suggest that the content of a registered mark is government speech. If the federal registration of a trademark makes the mark government speech, the Federal Government is babbling prodigiously and incoherently. It is saying many unseemly things. See App. to Brief for Pro-Football, Inc., as Amicus Curiae. It is expressing contradictory views.9 It is unashamedly endorsing a vast array of commercial products and services. And it is providing Delphic advice to the consuming public.\n\n     For example, if trademarks represent government speech, what does the Government have in mind when it advises Americans to \"make.believe\" (Sony),10 \"Think different\" (Apple),11 \"Just do it\" (Nike),12 or \"Have it your way\" (Burger King)13? Was the Government warning about a coming disaster when it registered the mark \"EndTime Ministries\"14?\n\n     The PTO has made it clear that registration does not constitute approval of a mark. See In re Old Glory Condom Corp., 26 USPQ 2d 1216, 1220, n. 3 (TTAB 1993) (\"[I]ssuance of a trademark registration . . . is not a government imprimatur\"). And it is unlikely that more than a tiny fraction of the public has any idea what federal registration of a trademark means. See Application of National Distillers & Chemical Corp., 49 C. C. P. A. (Pat.) 854, 863, 297 F. 2d 941, 949 (1962) (Rich, J., concurring) (\"The purchasing public knows no more about trademark registrations than a man walking down the street in a strange city knows about legal title to the land and buildings he passes\" (emphasis deleted)).\n\n     None of our government speech cases even remotely supports the idea that registered trademarks are government speech. In Johanns, we considered advertisements promoting the sale of beef products. A federal statute called for the creation of a program of paid advertising \" 'to advance the image and desirability of beef and beef products.' \" 544 U. S., at 561 (quoting 7 U. S. C. \u00a7 2902(13)). Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture provided guidelines for the content of the ads, Department of Agriculture officials attended the meetings at which the content of specific ads was discussed, and the Secretary could edit or reject any proposed ad. 544 U. S., at 561. Noting that \"[t]he message set out in the beef promotions [was] from beginning to end the message established by the Federal Government,\" we held that the ads were government speech. Id., at 560. The Government's involvement in the creation of these beef ads bears no resemblance to anything that occurs when a trademark is registered.\n\n     Our decision in Summum is similarly far afield. A small city park contained 15 monuments. 555 U. S., at 464. Eleven had been donated by private groups, and one of these displayed the Ten Commandments. Id., at 464-465. A religious group claimed that the city, by accepting donated monuments, had created a limited public forum for private speech and was therefore obligated to place in the park a monument expressing the group's religious beliefs.\n\n     Holding that the monuments in the park represented government speech, we cited many factors. Governments have used monuments to speak to the public since ancient times; parks have traditionally been selective in accepting and displaying donated monuments; parks would be overrun if they were obligated to accept all monuments offered by private groups; \"[p]ublic parks are often closely identified in the public mind with the government unit that owns the land\"; and \"[t]he monuments that are accepted . . . are meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a government message.\" Id., at 472.\n\n     Trademarks share none of these characteristics. Trademarks have not traditionally been used to convey a Government message. With the exception of the enforcement of 15 U. S. C. \u00a71052(a), the viewpoint expressed by a mark has not played a role in the decision whether to place it on the principal register. And there is no evidence that the public associates the contents of trademarks with the Federal Government.\n\n     This brings us to the case on which the Government relies most heavily, Walker, which likely marks the outer bounds of the government-speech doctrine. Holding that the messages on Texas specialty license plates are government speech, the Walker Court cited three factors distilled from Summum. 576 U. S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 7-8). First, license plates have long been used by the States to convey state messages. Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 9-10). Second, license plates \"are often closely identified in the public mind\" with the State, since they are manufactured and owned by the State, generally designed by the State, and serve as a form of \"government ID.\" Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted). Third, Texas \"maintain[ed] direct control over the messages conveyed on its specialty plates.\" Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11). As explained above, none of these factors are present in this case.\n\n     In sum, the federal registration of trademarks is vastly different from the beef ads in Johanns, the monuments in Summum, and even the specialty license plates in Walker. Holding that the registration of a trademark converts the mark into government speech would constitute a huge and dangerous extension of the government-speech doctrine. For if the registration of trademarks constituted government speech, other systems of government registration could easily be characterized in the same way.\n\n     Perhaps the most worrisome implication of the Government's argument concerns the system of copyright registration. If federal registration makes a trademark government speech and thus eliminates all First Amendment protection, would the registration of the copyright for a book produce a similar transformation? See 808 F. 3d, at 1346 (explaining that if trademark registration amounts to government speech, \"then copyright registration\" which \"has identical accoutrements\" would \"likewise amount to government speech\").\n\n     The Government attempts to distinguish copyright on the ground that it is \" 'the engine of free expression,' \" Brief for Petitioner 47 (quoting Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U. S. 186, 219 (2003)), but as this case illustrates, trademarks often have an expressive content. Companies spend huge amounts to create and publicize trademarks that convey a message. It is true that the necessary brevity of trademarks limits what they can say. But powerful messages can sometimes be conveyed in just a few words.\n\n     Trademarks are private, not government, speech.\n\nB\n\n     We next address the Government's argument that this case is governed by cases in which this Court has upheld the constitutionality of government programs that subsidized speech expressing a particular viewpoint. These cases implicate a notoriously tricky question of constitutional law. \"[W]e have held that the Government 'may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected . . . freedom of speech even if he has no entitlement to that benefit.' \" Agency for Int'l Development v. Alliance for Open Society Int'l, Inc., 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8) (some internal quotation marks omitted). But at the same time, government is not required to subsidize activities that it does not wish to promote. Ibid. Determining which of these principles applies in a particular case \"is not always self-evident,\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 11), but no difficult question is presented here.\n\n     Unlike the present case, the decisions on which the Government relies all involved cash subsidies or their equivalent. In Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173 (1991), a federal law provided funds to private parties for family planning services. In National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S. 569 (1998), cash grants were awarded to artists. And federal funding for public libraries was at issue in United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194 (2003). In other cases, we have regarded tax benefits as comparable to cash subsidies. See Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540 (1983); Cammarano v. United States, 358 U. S 498 (1959).\n\n     The federal registration of a trademark is nothing like the programs at issue in these cases. The PTO does not pay money to parties seeking registration of a mark. Quite the contrary is true: An applicant for registration must pay the PTO a filing fee of $225-$600. 37 CFR \u00a72.6(a)(1). (Tam submitted a fee of $275 as part of his application to register THE SLANTS. App. 18.) And to maintain federal registration, the holder of a mark must pay a fee of $300-$500 every 10 years. \u00a72.6(a)(5); see also 15 U. S. C. \u00a71059(a). The Federal Circuit concluded that these fees have fully supported the registration system for the past 27 years. 808 F. 3d, at 1353.\n\n     The Government responds that registration provides valuable non-monetary benefits that \"are directly traceable to the resources devoted by the federal government to examining, publishing, and issuing certificates of registration for those marks.\" Brief for Petitioner 27. But just about every government service requires the expenditure of government funds. This is true of services that benefit everyone, like police and fire protection, as well as services that are utilized by only some, e.g., the adjudication of private lawsuits and the use of public parks and highways.\n\n     Trademark registration is not the only government registration scheme. For example, the Federal Government registers copyrights and patents. State governments and their subdivisions register the title to real property and security interests; they issue driver's licenses, motor vehicle registrations, and hunting, fishing, and boating licenses or permits.\n\n     Cases like Rust and Finley are not instructive in analyzing the constitutionality of restrictions on speech imposed in connection with such services.\n\nC\n\n     Finally, the Government urges us to sustain the disparagement clause under a new doctrine that would apply to \"government-program\" cases. For the most part, this argument simply merges our government-speech cases and the previously discussed subsidy cases in an attempt to construct a broader doctrine that can be applied to the registration of trademarks. The only new element in this construct consists of two cases involving a public employer's collection of union dues from its employees. But those cases occupy a special area of First Amendment case law, and they are far removed from the registration of trademarks.\n\n     In Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U. S. 177, 181-182 (2007), a Washington law permitted a public employer automatically to deduct from the wages of employees who chose not to join the union the portion of union dues used for activities related to collective bargaining. But unless these employees affirmatively consented, the law did not allow the employer to collect the portion of union dues that would be used in election activities. Id., at 180-182. A public employee union argued that this law unconstitutionally restricted its speech based on its content; that is, the law permitted the employer to assist union speech on matters relating to collective bargaining but made it harder for the union to collect money to support its election activities. Id., at 188. Upholding this law, we characterized it as imposing a \"modest limitation\" on an \"extraordinary benefit,\" namely, taking money from the wages of non-union members and turning it over to the union free of charge. Id., at 184. Refusing to confer an even greater benefit, we held, did not upset the marketplace of ideas and did not abridge the union's free speech rights. Id., at 189-190.\n\n     Ysursa v. Pocatello Ed. Assn., 555 U. S. 353 (2009), is similar. There, we considered an Idaho law that allowed public employees to elect to have union dues deducted from their wages but did not allow such a deduction for money remitted to the union's political action committee. Id., at 355. We reasoned that the \"the government . . . [was] not required to assist others in funding the expression of particular ideas.\" Id., at 358; see also id., at 355 (\"The First Amendment . . . does not confer an affirmative right to use government payroll mechanisms for the purpose of obtaining funds for expression\").\n\n     Davenport and Ysursa are akin to our subsidy cases. Although the laws at issue in Davenport and Ysursa did not provide cash subsidies to the unions, they conferred a very valuable benefit--the right to negotiate a collective-bargaining agreement under which non-members would be obligated to pay an agency fee that the public employer would collect and turn over to the union free of charge. As in the cash subsidy cases, the laws conferred this benefit because it was thought that this arrangement served important government interests. See Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209, 224-226 (1977). But the challenged laws did not go further and provide convenient collection mechanisms for money to be used in political activities. In essence, the Washington and Idaho lawmakers chose to confer a substantial non-cash benefit for the purpose of furthering activities that they particularly desired to promote but not to provide a similar benefit for the purpose of furthering other activities. Thus, Davenport and Ysursa are no more relevant for present purposes than the subsidy cases previously discussed.15\n\n     Potentially more analogous are cases in which a unit of government creates a limited public forum for private speech. See, e.g., Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 106-107 (2001); Rosenberger v. Rec-tor and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 831 (1995); Lamb's Chapel, 508 U. S., at 392-393. See also Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 541-544 (2001). When government creates such a forum, in either a literal or \"metaphysical\" sense, see Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 830, some content- and speaker-based restrictions may be allowed, see id., at 830-831. However, even in such cases, what we have termed \"viewpoint discrimination\" is forbidden. Id., at 831.\n\n     Our cases use the term \"viewpoint\" discrimination in a broad sense, see ibid., and in that sense, the disparagement clause discriminates on the bases of \"viewpoint.\" To be sure, the clause evenhandedly prohibits disparagement of all groups. It applies equally to marks that damn Democrats and Republicans, capitalists and socialists, and those arrayed on both sides of every possible issue. It denies registration to any mark that is offensive to a substantial percentage of the members of any group. But in the sense relevant here, that is viewpoint discrimination: Giving offense is a viewpoint.\n\n     We have said time and again that \"the public expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers.\" Street v. New York, 394 U. S. 576, 592 (1969). See also Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 414 (1989) (\"If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable\"); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 55-56 (1988); Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U. S. 611, 615 (1971); Bachellar v. Maryland, 397 U. S. 564, 567 (1970); Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.

S. 353, 365 (1937).\n\n     For this reason, the disparagement clause cannot be saved by analyzing it as a type of government program in which some content- and speaker-based restrictions are permitted.16\n\nIV\n\n     Having concluded that the disparagement clause cannot be sustained under our government-speech or subsidy cases or under the Government's proposed \"government-program\" doctrine, we must confront a dispute between the parties on the question whether trademarks are commercial speech and are thus subject to the relaxed scrutiny outlined in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980). The Government and amici supporting its position argue that all trademarks are commercial speech. They note that the central purposes of trademarks are commercial and that federal law regulates trademarks to promote fair and orderly interstate commerce. Tam and his amici, on the other hand, contend that many, if not all, trademarks have an expressive component. In other words, these trademarks do not simply identify the source of a product or service but go on to say something more, either about the product or service or some broader issue. The trademark in this case illustrates this point. The name \"The Slants\" not only identifies the band but expresses a view about social issues.\n\n     We need not resolve this debate between the parties because the disparagement clause cannot withstand even Central Hudson review.17 Under Central Hudson, a restriction of speech must serve \"a substantial interest,\" and it must be \"narrowly drawn.\" Id., at 564-565 (internal quotation marks omitted). This means, among other things, that \"[t]he regulatory technique may extend only as far as the interest it serves.\" Id., at 565. The disparagement clause fails this requirement.\n\n     It is claimed that the disparagement clause serves two interests. The first is phrased in a variety of ways in the briefs. Echoing language in one of the opinions below, the Government asserts an interest in preventing \" 'underrepresented groups' \" from being \" 'bombarded with demeaning messages in commercial advertising.' \" Brief for Petitioner 48 (quoting 808 F. 3d, at 1364 (Dyk, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). An amicus supporting the Government refers to \"encouraging racial tolerance and protecting the privacy and welfare of individuals.\" Brief for Native American Organizations as Amici Curiae 21. But no matter how the point is phrased, its unmistakable thrust is this: The Government has an interest in preventing speech expressing ideas that offend. And, as we have explained, that idea strikes at the heart of the First Amendment.  Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express \"the thought that we hate.\" United States v. Schwimmer, 279 U. S. 644, 655 (1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting).\n\n     The second interest asserted is protecting the orderly flow of commerce. See 808 F. 3d, at 1379-1381 (Reyna, J., dissenting); Brief for Petitioner 49; Brief for Native American Organizations as Amicus Curiae 18-21. Commerce, we are told, is disrupted by trademarks that \"involv[e] disparagement of race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and similar demographic classification.\" 808 F. 3d, at 1380-1381 (opinion of Reyna, J.). Such trademarks are analogized to discriminatory conduct, which has been recognized to have an adverse effect on commerce. See ibid.; Brief for Petitioner 49; Brief for Native American Organizations as Amici Curiae 18-20.\n\n     A simple answer to this argument is that the disparagement clause is not \"narrowly drawn\" to drive out trademarks that support invidious discrimination. The clause reaches any trademark that disparages any person, group, or institution. It applies to trademarks like the following: \"Down with racists,\" \"Down with sexists,\" \"Down with homophobes.\" It is not an anti-discrimination clause; it is a happy-talk clause. In this way, it goes much further than is necessary to serve the interest asserted.\n\n     The clause is far too broad in other ways as well. The clause protects every person living or dead as well as every institution. Is it conceivable that commerce would be disrupted by a trademark saying: \"James Buchanan was a disastrous president\" or \"Slavery is an evil institution\"?\n\n     There is also a deeper problem with the argument that commercial speech may be cleansed of any expression likely to cause offense. The commercial market is well stocked with merchandise that disparages prominent figures and groups, and the line between commercial and non-commercial speech is not always clear, as this case illustrates. If affixing the commercial label permits the suppression of any speech that may lead to political or social \"volatility,\" free speech would be endangered.\n\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n     For these reasons, we hold that the disparagement clause violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. The judgment of the Federal Circuit is affirmed.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n     JUSTICE GORSUCH took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nOpinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n\u2002582 U. S. ____ (2017)\n\nNo. 15-1293\n\nJOSEPH MATAL, INTERIM DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE, PETITIONER v. SIMON SHIAO TAM\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n[June 19, 2017]\n\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n\n     The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has denied the substantial benefits of federal trademark registration to the mark THE SLANTS. The PTO did so under the mandate of the disparagement clause in 15 U. S. C. \u00a71052(a), which prohibits the registration of marks that may \"disparage . . . or bring . . . into contemp[t] or disrepute\" any \"persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols.\"\n\n     As the Court is correct to hold, \u00a71052(a) constitutes viewpoint discrimination--a form of speech suppression so potent that it must be subject to rigorous constitutional scrutiny. The Government's action and the statute on which it is based cannot survive this scrutiny.\n\n     The Court is correct in its judgment, and I join Parts I, II, and III-A of its opinion. This separate writing explains in greater detail why the First Amendment's protections against viewpoint discrimination apply to the trademark here. It submits further that the viewpoint discrimination rationale renders unnecessary any extended treatment of other questions raised by the parties.\n\nI\n\n     Those few categories of speech that the government can regulate or punish--for instance, fraud, defamation, or incitement--are well established within our constitutional tradition. See United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. 460, 468 (2010). Aside from these and a few other narrow exceptions, it is a fundamental principle of the First Amendment that the government may not punish or suppress speech based on disapproval of the ideas or perspectives the speech conveys. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 828-829 (1995).\n\n     The First Amendment guards against laws \"targeted at specific subject matter,\" a form of speech suppression known as content based discrimination. Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 12). This category includes a subtype of laws that go further, aimed at the suppression of \"particular views . . . on a subject.\" Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 829. A law found to discriminate based on viewpoint is an \"egregious form of content discrimination,\" which is \"presumptively unconstitutional.\" Id., at 829-830.\n\n     At its most basic, the test for viewpoint discrimination is whether--within the relevant subject category--the government has singled out a subset of messages for disfavor based on the views expressed. See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806 (1985) (\"[T]he government violates the First Amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject\"). In the instant case, the disparagement clause the Government now seeks to implement and enforce identifies the relevant subject as \"persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols.\" 15 U. S. C. \u00a71052(a). Within that category, an applicant may register a positive or benign mark but not a derogatory one. The law thus reflects the Government's disapproval of a subset of messages it finds offensive. This is the essence of viewpoint discrimination.\n\n     The Government disputes this conclusion. It argues, to begin with, that the law is viewpoint neutral because it applies in equal measure to any trademark that demeans or offends. This misses the point. A subject that is first defined by content and then regulated or censored by mandating only one sort of comment is not viewpoint neutral. To prohibit all sides from criticizing their opponents makes a law more viewpoint based, not less so. Cf. Rosenberger, supra, at 831-832 (\"The . . . declaration that debate is not skewed so long as multiple voices are silenced is simply wrong; the debate is skewed in multiple ways\"). The logic of the Government's rule is that a law would be viewpoint neutral even if it provided that public officials could be praised but not condemned. The First Amendment's viewpoint neutrality principle protects more than the right to identify with a particular side. It protects the right to create and present arguments for particular positions in particular ways, as the speaker chooses. By mandating positivity, the law here might silence dissent and distort the marketplace of ideas.\n\n     The Government next suggests that the statute is viewpoint neutral because the disparagement clause applies to trademarks regardless of the applicant's personal views or reasons for using the mark. Instead, registration is denied based on the expected reaction of the applicant's audience. In this way, the argument goes, it cannot be said that Government is acting with hostility toward a particular point of view. For example, the Government does not dispute that respondent seeks to use his mark in a positive way. Indeed, respondent endeavors to use The Slants to supplant a racial epithet, using new insights, musical talents, and wry humor to make it a badge of pride. Respondent's application was denied not because the Government thought his object was to demean or offend but because the Government thought his trademark would have that effect on at least some Asian-Americans.\n\n     The Government may not insulate a law from charges of viewpoint discrimination by tying censorship to the reaction of the speaker's audience. The Court has suggested that viewpoint discrimination occurs when the government intends to suppress a speaker's beliefs, Reed, supra, at ___-___ (slip op., at 11-12), but viewpoint discrimination need not take that form in every instance. The danger of viewpoint discrimination is that the government is attempting to remove certain ideas or perspectives from a broader debate. That danger is all the greater if the ideas or perspectives are ones a particular audience might think offensive, at least at first hearing. An initial reaction may prompt further reflection, leading to a more reasoned, more tolerant position.\n\n     Indeed, a speech burden based on audience reactions is simply government hostility and intervention in a different guise. The speech is targeted, after all, based on the government's disapproval of the speaker's choice of message. And it is the government itself that is attempting in this case to decide whether the relevant audience would find the speech offensive. For reasons like these, the Court's cases have long prohibited the government from justifying a First Amendment burden by pointing to the offensiveness of the speech to be suppressed. See ante, at 23 (collecting examples).\n\n     The Government's argument in defense of the statute assumes that respondent's mark is a negative comment. In addressing that argument on its own terms, this opinion is not intended to imply that the Government's interpretation is accurate. From respondent's submissions, it is evident he would disagree that his mark means what the Government says it does. The trademark will have the effect, respondent urges, of reclaiming an offensive term for the positive purpose of celebrating all that Asian-Americans can and do contribute to our diverse Nation. Brief for Respondent 1-4, 42-43. While thoughtful persons can agree or disagree with this approach, the dissonance between the trademark's potential to teach and the Government's insistence on its own, opposite, and negative interpretation confirms the constitutional vice of the statute.\n\nII\n\n     The parties dispute whether trademarks are commercial speech and whether trademark registration should be considered a federal subsidy. The former issue may turn on whether certain commercial concerns for the protection of trademarks might, as a general matter, be the basis for regulation. However that issue is resolved, the viewpoint based discrimination at issue here necessarily invokes heightened scrutiny.\n\n     \"Commercial speech is no exception,\" the Court has explained, to the principle that the First Amendment \"requires heightened scrutiny whenever the government creates a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.\" Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U. S. 552, 566 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike content based discrimination, discrimination based on viewpoint, including a regulation that targets speech for its offensiveness, remains of serious concern in the commercial context. See Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 65, 71-72 (1983).\n\n     To the extent trademarks qualify as commercial speech, they are an example of why that term or category does not serve as a blanket exemption from the First Amendment's requirement of viewpoint neutrality. Justice Holmes' reference to the \"free trade in ideas\" and the \"power of . . . thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,\" Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 630 (1919) (dissenting opinion), was a metaphor. In the realm of trademarks, the metaphorical marketplace of ideas becomes a tangible, powerful reality. Here that real marketplace exists as a matter of state law and our common-law tradition, quite without regard to the Federal Government. See ante, at 2. These marks make up part of the expression of everyday life, as with the names of entertainment groups, broadcast networks, designer clothing, newspapers, automobiles, candy bars, toys, and so on. See Brief for Pro-Football, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 8 (collecting examples). Nonprofit organizations--ranging from medical-research charities and other humanitarian causes to political advocacy groups--also have trademarks, which they use to compete in a real economic sense for funding and other resources as they seek to persuade others to join their cause. See id., at 8-9 (collecting examples). To permit viewpoint discrimination in this context is to permit Government censorship.\n\n     This case does not present the question of how other provisions of the Lanham Act should be analyzed under the First Amendment. It is well settled, for instance, that to the extent a trademark is confusing or misleading the law can protect consumers and trademark owners. See, e.g., FTC v. Winstead Hosiery Co., 285 U. S. 483, 493 (1922) (\"The labels in question are literally false, and . . . palpably so. All are, as the Commission found, calculated to deceive and do in fact deceive a substantial portion of the purchasing public\"). This case also does not involve laws related to product labeling or otherwise designed to protect consumers. See Sorrell, supra, at 579 (\"[T]he government's legitimate interest in protecting consumers from commercial harms explains why commercial speech can be subject to greater governmental regulation than noncommercial speech\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). These considerations, however, do not alter the speech principles that bar the viewpoint discrimination embodied in the statutory provision at issue here.\n\n     It is telling that the Court's precedents have recognized just one narrow situation in which viewpoint discrimination is permissible: where the government itself is speaking or recruiting others to communicate a message on its behalf. See Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U. S. 533, 540-542 (2001); Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U. S. 217, 229, 235 (2000); Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 833. The exception is necessary to allow the government to stake out positions and pursue policies. See Southworth, supra, at 235; see also ante, at 13-14. But it is also narrow, to prevent the government from claiming that every government program is exempt from the First Amendment. These cases have identified a number of factors that, if present, suggest the government is speaking on its own behalf; but none are present here. See ante, at 14-18.\n\n     There may be situations where private speakers are selected for a government program to assist the government in advancing a particular message. That is not this case either. The central purpose of trademark registration is to facilitate source identification. To serve that broad purpose, the Government has provided the benefits of federal registration to millions of marks identifying every type of product and cause. Registered trademarks do so by means of a wide diversity of words, symbols, and messages. Whether a mark is disparaging bears no plausible relation to that goal. While defining the purpose and scope of a federal program for these purposes can be complex, see, e.g., Agency for Int'l Development v. Alliance for Open Society Int'l, Inc., 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8), our cases are clear that viewpoint discrimination is not permitted where, as here, the Government \"expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers,\" Velazquez, supra, at 542 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\n     A law that can be directed against speech found offensive to some portion of the public can be turned against minority and dissenting views to the detriment of all. The First Amendment does not entrust that power to the government's benevolence. Instead, our reliance must be on the substantial safeguards of free and open discussion in a democratic society.\n\n     For these reasons, I join the Court's opinion in part and concur in the judgment.\n\nTHOMAS, J., concurring\n\n\u2002582 U. S. ____ (2017)\n\nNo. 15-1293\n\nJOSEPH MATAL, INTERIM DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE, PETITIONER v. SIMON SHIAO TAM\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n[June 19, 2017]\n\n     JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n\n     I join the opinion of JUSTICE ALITO, except for Part II. Respondent failed to present his statutory argument either to the Patent and Trademark Office or to the Court of Appeals, and we declined respondent's invitation to grant certiorari on this question. Ante, at 9. I see no reason to address this legal question in the first instance. See Star Athletica, L. L. C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6).\n\n     I also write separately because \"I continue to believe that when the government seeks to restrict truthful speech in order to suppress the ideas it conveys, strict scrutiny is appropriate, whether or not the speech in question may be characterized as 'commercial.' \" Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, 572 (2001) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also, e.g., 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 518 (1996) (same). I nonetheless join Part IV of JUSTICE ALITO's opinion because it correctly concludes that the disparagement clause, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71052(a), is unconstitutional even under the less stringent test announced in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980).\n\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\nFootnote 1\n In the opinion below, the Federal Circuit opined that although \"Section 43(a) allows for a federal suit to protect an unregistered trademark,\" \"it is not at all clear\" that respondent could bring suit under \u00a743(a) because \"there is no authority extending \u00a743(a) to marks denied under \u00a72(a)'s disparagement provision.\" In re Tam, 808 F. 3d 1321, 1344-1345, n.11 (en banc), as corrected (Feb. 11, 2016). When drawing this conclusion, the Federal Circuit relied in part on our statement in Two Pesos that \"the general principles qualifying a mark for registration under \u00a72 of the Lanham Act are for the most part applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under \u00a743(a).\" 505 U. S., at 768. We need not decide today whether respondent could bring suit under \u00a743(a) if his application for federal registration had been lawfully denied under the disparagement clause.\n\n\nFootnote 2\n The disparagement clause also prevents a trademark from being registered on the supplemental register. \u00a71091(a).\n\n\nFootnote 3\n By \"composite,\" we assume the PTO means component.\n\n\nFootnote 4\n Tam advances a convoluted textual argument that goes as follows. The definition of a \"person\" in 15 U. S. C. \u00a71127 does not include a \"non-juristic person,\" i.e., a group that cannot sue or be sued in its own right. Brief for Respondent 46-47. Such groups consist of multiple natural persons. Therefore, the members of such groups are not \"persons\" under the disparagement clause. Id., at 46-48.\n\n     This argument leads to the absurd result that no person is a \"person\" within the meaning of the disparagement clause. This is so because every person is a member of a \"non-juristic\" group, e.g., right-handers, left-handers, women, men, people born on odd-numbered days, people born on even-numbered days.\n\n\nFootnote 5\n The PTO has acknowledged that the guidelines \"for determining whether a mark is scandalous or disparaging are somewhat vague and the determination of whether a mark is scandalous or disparaging is necessarily a highly subjective one.\" In re In Over Our Heads, Inc., 16 USPQ 2d 1653, 1654 (TTAB 1990) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). The PTO has similarly observed that whether a mark is disparaging \"is highly subjective and, thus, general rules are difficult to postulate.\" Harjo v. Pro-Football Inc., 50 USPQ 2d 1705, 1737 (TTAB 1999), rev'd, 284 F.

Altai, Inc.\nU.S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit\nJune 22, 1992\n982 F.2d 693, 23 USPQ2d 1241\n[Editor's note: This case is discussed in Legal Protection of Digital Information in:\nChapter 2, Section III.

(Using a Clean Room).]\n\nWalker, J.\n\nIn recent years, the growth of computer science has spawned a number of challenging legal questions, particularly in the field of copyright law. As scientific knowledge advances, courts endeavor to keep pace, and sometimes \u2013 as in the area of computer technology \u2013 they are required to venture into less than familiar waters. This is not a new development, though. \u201cFrom its beginning, the law of copyright has developed in response to significant changes in technology.\u201d Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417, 430 [220 USPQ 665] (1984).\nArticle I, section 8 of the Constitution authorizes Congress \u201c[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\u201d The Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[t]he economic philosophy behind the clause . . . is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare.\u201d Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 219 [100 USPQ 325] (1954). The author\u2019s benefit, however, is clearly a \u201csecondary\u201d consideration. SeeUnited States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 158 [77 USPQ 243] (1948). \u201c[T]he ultimate aim is, by this incentive, to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.\u201d Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151, 156 [186 USPQ 65] (1975).\nThus, the copyright law seeks to establish a delicate equilibrium. On the one hand, it affords protection to authors as an incentive to create, and, on the other, it must appropriately limit the extent of that protection so as to avoid the effects of monopolistic stagnation. In applying the federal act to new types of cases, courts must always keep this symmetry in mind. Id .\nAmong other things, this case deals with the challenging question of whether and to what extent the \u201cnon-literal\u201d aspects of a computer program, that is, those aspects that are not reduced to a written code, are protected by copyright. While a few other courts have already grappled with this issue, this case is one of first impression in this circuit. As we shall discuss, we find the results <23 USPQ2d 1245> reached by other courts to be less than satisfactory. Drawing upon long-standing doctrines of copyright law, we take an approach that we think better addresses the practical difficulties embedded in these types of cases. In so doing, we have kept in mind the necessary balance between creative incentive and industrial competition.\nThis appeal comes to us from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the Honorable George C. Pratt, Circuit Judge, sitting by designation. By Memorandum and Order entered August 12, 1991, Judge Pratt found that defendant Altai, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cAltai\u201d), OSCAR 3.4 computer program had infringed plaintiff Computer Associates\u2019 (\u201cCA\u201d), copyrighted computer program entitled CA-SCHEDULER. Accordingly, the district court awarded CA $364,444 in actual damages and apportioned profits. Altai has <982 F.2d 697> abandoned its appeal from this award. With respect to CA\u2019s second claim for copyright infringement, Judge Pratt found that Altai\u2019s OSCAR 3.5 program was not substantially similar to a portion of CA-SCHEDULER called ADAPTER, and thus denied relief. Finally, the district court concluded that CA\u2019s state law trade secret misappropriation claim against Altai had been preempted by the federal copyright act. CA appealed from these findings.\nBecause we are in full agreement with Judge Pratt\u2019s decision and in substantial agreement with his careful reasoning, we affirm the judgment of the district court in its entirety.\nBackground\n\nWe assume familiarity with the facts set forth in the district court\u2019s comprehensive and scholarly opinion. See Computer Associates Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 775 F.Supp.544, 549-55 [20 USPQ2d 1641] (E.D.N.Y. 1991). Thus, we summarize only those facts necessary to resolve this appeal.\nI. Computer Program Design\n\nCertain elementary facts concerning the nature of computer programs are vital to the following discussion. The Copyright Act defines a computer program as \u201ca set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.\u201d 17 U.S.C. Section 101 . In writing these directions, the programmer works \u201cfrom the general to the specific.\u201d Whelan Associates, Inc. v. Jaslow Dental Laboratory, Inc., 797 F.2d 1222, 1229 [230 USPQ 481] (3d Cir. 1986), cert. denied,479 U.S. 1031 (1987). See generally, Steven R. Englund, Note,Idea, Process, or Protected Expression?: Determining the Scope of Copyright Protection of the Structure of Computer Programs, 88 MICH. L. REV. 866, 867-73 (1990) (hereinafter \u201cEnglund\u201d); Peter S. Menell, An Analysis of the Scope of Copyright Protection for Application Programs, 41 STAN. L. REV. 1045, 1051-57 (1989) (hereinafter \u201cMenell\u201d); Mark T. Kretschmer, Note, Copyright Protection For Software Architecture: Just Say No!, 1988 COLUM. BUS. L. REV. 823, 824-27 (1988) (hereinafter \u201cKretschmer\u201d); Peter G. Spivack, Comment, Does Form Follow Function? The Idea/Expression Dichotomy In Copyright Protection of Computer Software, 35 U.C.L.A. L. REV. 723, 729-31 (1988) (hereinafter \u201cSpivack\u201d).\nThe first step in this procedure is to identify a program\u2019s ultimate function or purpose. An example of such an ultimate purpose might be the creation and maintenance of a business ledger. Once this goal has been achieved, a programmer breaks down or \u201cdecomposes\u201d the program\u2019s ultimate function into \u201csimpler constituent problems or \u2018subtasks,\u2019 \u201c Englund, at 870 , which are also known as subroutines or modules. SeeSpivack, at 729 . In the context of a business ledger program, a module or subroutine might be responsible for the task of updating a list of outstanding accounts receivable. Sometimes, depending upon the complexity of its task, a subroutine may be broken down further into sub-subroutines.\nHaving sufficiently decomposed the program\u2019s ultimate function into its component elements, a programmer will then arrange the subroutines or modules into what are known as organizational or flow charts. Flow charts map the interactions between modules that achieve the program\u2019s end goal. See Kretschmer, at 826.\nIn order to accomplish these intra-program interactions, a programmer must carefully design each module\u2019s parameter list. A parameter list, according to the expert appointed and fully credited by the district court, Dr. Randall Davis, is \u201cthe information sent to and received from a subroutine.\u201d See Report of Dr. Randall Davis, at 12 . The term \u201cparameter list\u201d refers to the form in which information is passed between modules (e.g.for accounts receivable, the designated time frame and particular customer identifying number) and the information\u2019s actual content <982 F.2d 698> (e.g. 8/91-7/92; customer No. 3). Id . With respect to form, interacting modules must share similar parameter lists so that they are capable of exchanging information.<23 USPQ2d 1246>\n\u201cThe functions of the modules in a program together with each module\u2019s relationships to other modules constitute the \u2018structure\u2019 of the program.\u201d Englund, at 871 . Additionally, the term structure may include the category of modules referred to as \u201cmacros.\u201d A macro is a single instruction that initiates a sequence of operations or module interactions within the program. Very often the user will accompany a macro with an instruction from the parameter list to refine the instruction (e.g. current total of accounts receivable (macro), but limited to those for 8/91 to 7/92 from customer No. 3 (parameters)).\nIn fashioning the structure, a programmer will normally attempt to maximize the program\u2019s speed, efficiency, as well as simplicity for user operation, while taking into consideration certain externalities such as the memory constraints of the computer upon which the program will be run. See id.; Kretschmer, at 826; Menell, at 1052. \u201cThis stage of program design often requires the most time and investment.\u201d Kretschmer, at 826 .\nOnce each necessary module has been identified, designed, and its relationship to the other modules has been laid out conceptually, the resulting program structure must be embodied in a written language that the computer can read. This process is called \u201ccoding,\u201d and requires two steps. Whelan,797 F.2d at 1230 . First, the programmer must transpose the program\u2019s structural blue-print into a source code. This step has been described as \u201ccomparable to the novelist fleshing out the broad outline of his plot by crafting from words and sentences the paragraphs that convey the ideas.\u201d Kretschmer, at 826 . The source code may be written in any one of several computer languages, such as COBAL, FORTRAN, BASIC, EDL, etc., depending upon the type of computer for which the program is intended. Whelan, 797 F.2d at 1230 . Once the source code has been completed, the second step is to translate or \u201ccompile\u201d it into object code. Object code is the binary language comprised of zeros and ones through which the computer directly receives its instructions. Id.,at 1230-31 ; Englund, at 868 & n.13 .\nAfter the coding is finished, the programmer will run the program on the computer in order to find and correct any logical and syntactical errors. This is known as \u201cdebugging\u201d and, once done, the program is complete. See Kretschemer,at 826-27 .\nII. Facts\n\nCA is a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business in Garden City, New York. Altai is a Texas corporation, doing business primarily in Arlington, Texas. Both companies are in the computer software industry \u2013 designing, developing and marketing various types of computer programs.\nThe subject of this litigation originates with one of CA\u2019s marketed programs entitled CA-SCHEDULER. CA-SCHEDULER is a job scheduling program designed for IBM mainframe computers. Its primary functions are straightforward: to create a schedule specifying when the computer should run various tasks, and then to control the computer as it executes the schedule. CA-SCHEDULER contains a sub-program entitled ADAPTER, also developed by CA. ADAPTER is not an independently marketed product of CA; it is a wholly integrated component of CA-SCHEDULER and has no capacity for independent use.\nNevertheless, ADAPTER plays an extremely important role. It is an \u201coperating system compatibility component,\u201d which means, roughly speaking, it serves as a translator. An \u201coperating system\u201d is itself a program that manages the resources of the computer, allocating those resources to other programs as needed. The IBM\u2019s System 370 family of computers, for which CA-SCHEDULER was created, is, depending upon the computer\u2019s size, designed to contain one of three operating systems: DOS/VSE, MVS, or CMS. As the district court noted, the general rule is that \u201ca <982 F.2d 699> program written for one operating system, e.g., DOS/VSE, will not, without modification, run under another operating system such as MVS.\u201d Computer Associates, 775 F. Supp. at 550 . ADAPTER\u2019s function is to translate the language of a given program into the particular language that the computer\u2019s own operating system can understand.\nThe district court succinctly outlined the manner in which ADAPTER works within the context of the larger program. In order to enable CA-SCHEDULER to function on different operating systems, CA divided the CA-SCHEDULER into two components:\n\u2013 a first component that contains only the task-specific portions of the program, independent of all operating system issues, and\n\u2013 a second component that contains all the interconnections between the first component and the operating system.<23 USPQ2d 1247>\nIn a program constructed in this way, whenever the first, task-specific, component needs to ask the operating system for some resource through a \u201csystem call\u201d, it calls the second component instead of calling the operating system directly.\nThe second component serves as an \u201cinterface\u201d or \u201ccompatibility component\u201d between the task-specific portion of the program and the operating system. It receives the request from the first component and translates it into the appropriate system call that will be recognized by whatever operating system is installed on the computer, e.g., DOS/VSE, MVS, or CMS. Since the first, task-specific component calls the adapter component rather than the operating system, the first component need not be customized to use any specific operating system. The second interface component insures that all the system calls are performed properly for the particular operating system in use. Id.at 551 .\nADAPTER serves as the second, \u201ccommon system interface\u201d component referred to above.\nA program like ADAPTER, which allows a computer user to change or use multiple operating systems while maintaining the same software, is highly desirable. It saves the user the costs, both in time and money, that otherwise would be expended in purchasing new programs, modifying existing systems to run them, and gaining familiarity with their operation. The benefits run both ways. The increased compatibility afforded by an ADAPTER-like component, and its resulting popularity among consumers, makes whatever software in which it is incorporated significantly more marketable.\nStarting in 1982, Altai began marketing its own job scheduling program entitled ZEKE. The original version of ZEKE was designed for use in conjunction with a VSE operating system. By late 1983, in response to customer demand, Altai decided to rewrite ZEKE so that it could be run in conjunction with an MVS operating system.\nAt that time, James P. Williams (\u201cWilliams\u201d), then an employee of Altai and now its President, approached Claude F. Arney, III (\u201cArney\u201d), a computer programmer who worked for CA. Williams and Arney were longstanding friends, and had in fact been co-workers at CA for some time before Williams left CA to work for Altai\u2019s predecessor. Williams wanted to recruit Arney to assist Altai in designing an MVS version of ZEKE.\nAt the time he first spoke with Arney, Williams was aware of both the CA-SCHEDULER and ADAPTER programs. However, Williams was not involved in their development and had never seen the codes of either program. When he asked Arney to come work for Altai, Williams did not know that ADAPTER was a component of CA-SCHEDULER.\nArney, on the other hand, was intimately familiar with various aspects of ADAPTER. While working for CA, he helped improve the VSE version of ADAPTER, and was permitted to take home a copy of ADAPTER\u2019s source code. This apparently developed into an irresistible habit, for when Arney left CA to work for Altai in January, 1984, he took with him copies of <982 F.2d 700> the source code for both the VSE and MVS versions of ADAPTER. He did this in knowing violation of the CA employee agreements that he had signed.\nOnce at Altai, Arney and Williams discussed design possibilities for adapting ZEKE to run on MVS operating systems. Williams, who had created the VSE version of ZEKE, thought that approximately 30% of his original program would have to be modified in order to accommodate MVS. Arney persuaded Williams that the best way to make the needed modifications was to introduce a \u201ccommon system interface\u201d component into ZEKE. He did not tell Williams that his idea stemmed from his familiarity with ADAPTER. They decided to name this new component-program OSCAR.\nArney went to work creating OSCAR. No one at Altai, including Williams, knew that he had the ADAPTER code, and no one knew that he was using it to design OSCAR/VSE. In three months, Arney successfully completed the OSCAR/VSE project. In an additional month he developed an OSCAR/MVS version. When the dust finally settled, Arney had copied approximately 30% of OSCAR\u2019s code from CA\u2019s ADAPTER program.\nThe first generation of OSCAR programs was known as OSCAR 3.4. From 1985 to August 1988, Altai used OSCAR 3.4 in its ZEKE product, as well as in programs entitled ZACK and ZEBB. In late July 1988, CA first learned that Altai may have appropriated parts of ADAPTER. After confirming its suspicions, CA secured copyrights on its 2.1 and 7.0 versions of CA-SCHEDULER. CA then brought this copyright and trade secret misappropriation action against Altai.\nApparently, it was upon receipt of the summons and complaint that Altai first learned that Arney had copied much of the OSCAR code from ADAPTER. After Arney confirmed to Williams that CA\u2019s accusations of copying were true, Williams <23 USPQ2d 1248> immediately set out to survey the damage. Without ever looking at the ADAPTER code himself, Williams learned from Arney exactly which sections of code Arney had taken from ADAPTER.\nUpon advice of counsel, Williams initiated OSCAR\u2019s rewrite. The project\u2019s goal was to save as much of OSCAR 3.4 as legitimately could be used, and to excise those portions which had been copied from ADAPTER. Arney was entirely excluded from the process, and his copy of the ADAPTER code was locked away. Williams put eight other programmers on the project, none of whom had been involved in any way in the development of OSCAR 3.4. Williams provided the programmers with a description of the ZEKE operating system services so that they could rewrite the appropriate code. The rewrite project took about six months to complete and was finished in mid-November 1989. The resulting program was entitled OSCAR 3.5.\nFrom that point on, Altai shipped only OSCAR 3.5 to its new customers. Altai also shipped OSCAR 3.5 as a \u201cfree upgrade\u201d to all customers that had previously purchased OSCAR 3.4. While Altai and Williams acted responsibly to correct what Arney had wrought, the damage was done. CA\u2019s lawsuit remained.\nAfter CA originally instituted this action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, the parties stipulated its transfer in March, 1989, to the Eastern District of New York where it was assigned to Judge Jacob Mishler. On October 26, 1989, Judge Mishler transferred the case to Judge Pratt who was sitting in the district court by designation. Judge Pratt conducted a six day trial from March 28 through April 6, 1990.He entered judgment on August 12, 1991,and this appeal followed.<982 F.2d 701>\nDiscussion\n\nWhile both parties originally appealed from different aspects of the district court\u2019s judgment, Altai has now abandoned its appellate claims. In particular, Altai has conceded liability for the copying of ADAPTER into OSCAR 3.4 and raises no challenge to the award of $364,444 in damages on that score. Thus, we address only CA\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s rulings that: (1) Altai was not liable for copyright infringement in developing OSCAR 3.5; and (2) in developing both OSCAR 3.4 and 3.5, Altai was not liable for misappropriating CA\u2019s trade secrets.\nCA makes two arguments. First, CA contends that the district court applied an erroneous method for determining whether there exists substantial similarity between computer programs, and thus, erred in determining that OSCAR 3.5 did not infringe the copyrights held on the different versions of its CA-SCHEDULER program. CA asserts that the test applied by the district court failed to account sufficiently for a computer program\u2019s non-literal elements. Second, CA maintains that the district court erroneously concluded that its state law trade secret claims had been preempted by the federal copyright act, see 17 U.S.C. Section 301(a) . We shall address each argument in turn.\nI. Copyright Infringement\n\nIn any suit for copyright infringement, the plaintiff must establish its ownership of a valid copyright, and that the defendant copied the copyrighted work. See Novelty Textile Mills, Inc. v. Joan Fabrics Corp., 558 F.2d 1090, 1092 [195 USPQ 1] (2d Cir. 1977); see also 3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright Section 13.01, at 13-4 (1991) (hereinafter \u201cNimmer\u201d). The plaintiff may prove defendant\u2019s copying either by direct evidence or, as is most often the case, by showing that (1) the defendant had access to the plaintiff\u2019s copyrighted work and (2) that defendant\u2019s work is substantially similar to the plaintiff\u2019s copyrightable material. See Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc., 784 F.2d 44, 48 [228 USPQ 505] (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159 (1986).\nFor the purpose of analysis, the district court assumed that Altai had access to the ADAPTER code when creating OSCAR 3.5. See Computer Associates, 775 F. Supp. at 558 . Thus, in determining whether Altai had unlawfully copied protected aspects of CA\u2019s ADAPTER, the district court narrowed its focus of inquiry to ascertaining whether Altai\u2019s OSCAR 3.5 was substantially similar to ADAPTER. Because we approve Judge Pratt\u2019s conclusions regarding substantial similarity, our analysis will proceed along the same assumption.\nAs a general matter, and to varying degrees, copyright protection extends beyond a literary work\u2019s strictly textual form to its non-literal components. As we have said, \u201c[i]t is of course essential to any protection of literary property . . . that the right cannot be limited literally to the text, else a plagiarist would escape by immaterial variations.\u201d Nichols v. Universal Pictures Co., 45 F.2d 119, 121 [7 USPQ 84] (2d Cir. 1930) (L. Hand, J.), cert. denied, 282 U.S. 902 (1931). Thus, where \u201cthe fundamental essence or structure of one work is duplicated in an <23 USPQ2d 1249> other,\u201d 3 Nimmer, Section 13.03 [A] [1], at 13-24 , courts have found copyright infringement. See, e.g., Horgan v. Macmillan, 789 F.2d 157, 162 [229 USPQ 684] (2d Cir. 1986) (recognizing that a book of photographs might infringe ballet choreography); Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. MCA, Inc., 715 F.2d 1327, 1329 [217 USPQ 611] (9th Cir. 1983) (motion picture and television series); Sid & Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., 562 F.2d 1157, 1167 [196 USPQ 97] (9th Cir. 1977) (television commercial and television series); Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 81 F.2d 49, 55 [28 USPQ 330] (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 298 U.S. 669 (1936) (play and motion picture); accord Stewart v. Abend,495 U.S. 207, 238 [14 USPQ2d 1614] (1990) (recognizing that motion picture may infringe copyright in book by using its \u201cunique setting, characters, plot, and sequence of events\u201d). This black letter proposition is the springboard for our discussion. <982 F.2d 702>\nA. Copyright Protection for the Non-literal Elements of Computer Programs\n\nIt is now well settled that the literal elements of computer programs, i.e., their source and object codes, are the subject of copyright protection. See Whelan, 797 F.2d at 1233 (source and object code); CMS Software Design Sys., Inc. v. Info Designs, Inc., 785 F.2d 1246, 1249 [229 USPQ 311] (5th Cir. 1986) (source code); Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F.2d 1240, 1249 [219 USPQ 113] (3d Cir. 1983), cert. dismissed, 464 U.S. 1033 (1984) (source and object code);Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Artic Int\u2019l, Inc., 685 F.2d 870, 876-77 [215 USPQ 405] (3d Cir. 1982) (object code). Here, as noted earlier, Altai admits having copied approximately 30% of the OSCAR 3.4 program from CA\u2019s ADAPTER source code, and does not challenge the district court\u2019s related finding of infringement.\nIn this case, the hotly contested issues surround OSCAR 3.5. As recounted above, OSCAR 3.5 is the product of Altai\u2019s carefully orchestrated rewrite of OSCAR 3.4. After the purge, none of the ADAPTER source code remained in the 3.5 version; thus, Altai made sure that the literal elements of its revamped OSCAR program were no longer substantially similar to the literal elements of CA\u2019s ADAPTER.\nAccording to CA, the district court erroneously concluded that Altai\u2019s OSCAR 3.5 was not substantially similar to its own ADAPTER program. CA argues that this occurred because the district court \u201ccommitted legal error in analyzing [its] claims of copyright infringement by failing to find that copyright protects expression contained in the non-literal elements of computer software.\u201d We disagree.\nCA argues that, despite Altai\u2019s rewrite of the OSCAR code, the resulting program remained substantially similar to the structure of its ADAPTER program. As discussed above, a program\u2019s structure includes its non-literal components such as general flow charts as well as the more specific organization of inter-modular relationships, parameter lists, and macros. In addition to these aspects, CA contends that OSCAR 3.5 is also substantially similar to ADAPTER with respect to the list of services that both ADAPTER and OSCAR obtain from their respective operating systems. We must decide whether and to what extent these elements of computer programs are protected by copyright law.\nThe statutory terrain in this area has been well explored. See Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Paperback Software Int\u2019l, 740 F. Supp. 37, 47-51 [15 USPQ2d 1577] (D. Mass. 1990); see also Whelan, 797 F.2d at 1240-42 ; Englund, at 885-90 ; Spivack, at 731-37 . The Copyright Act affords protection to \u201coriginal works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.\u201d 17 U.S.C. Section 102(a) . This broad category of protected \u201cworks\u201d includes \u201cliterary works,\u201d id., which are defined by the act as\nworks, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords, film tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied.\n17 U.S.C. Section 101. While computer programs are not specifically listed as part of the above statutory definition, the legislative history leaves no doubt that Congress intended them to be considered literary works. See H.R.Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 54, reprinted in 1976 U.S. C. C. A. N. 5659, 5667 (hereinafter \u201cHouse Report\u201d); Whelan,797 F.2d at 1234 ; Apple Computer, 714 F.2d at 1247 .\nThe syllogism that follows from the foregoing premises is a powerful one: if the non-literal structures of literary works are protected by copyright; and if computer programs are literary works, as we are told by the legislature; then the non-literal structures of computer programs are protected by copyright. See Whelan, 797 F.2d at 1234 (\u201cBy analogy to other literary works, it would thus appear that the copyrights of computer programs can be infringed even absent copying of the literal elements of the <23 USPQ2d 1250> program.\u201d). We have no reservation in joining the company of those courts that have already ascribed to this logic. See, e.g., Johnson Controls, Inc. v. <982 F.2d 703> Phoenix Control Sys., Inc., 886 F.2d 1173, 1175 [12 USPQ2d 1566] (9th Cir. 1989); Lotus Dev. Corp., 740 F. Supp. at 54 ; Digital Communications Assocs., Inc. v. Softklone Distrib. Corp., 659 F. Supp. 449, 455-56 [2 USPQ2d 1385] (N.D.Ga. 1987); Q-Co Indus., Inc. v. Hoffman, 625 F. Supp. 608, 615 [228 USPQ 554] (S.D.N.Y. 1985); SAS Institute, Inc. v. S & H Computer Sys., Inc., 605 F. Supp. 816, 829-30 [225 USPQ 916] (M.D.Tenn. 1985). However, that conclusion does not end our analysis. We must determine the scope of copyright protection that extends to a computer program\u2019s non-literal structure.\nAs a caveat, we note that our decision here does not control infringement actions regarding categorically distinct works, such as certain types of screen displays. These items represent products of computer programs, rather than the programs themselves, and fall under the copyright rubric of audiovisual works. If a computer audiovisual display is copyrighted separately as an audiovisual work, apart from the literary work that generates it (i.e., the program), the display may be protectable regardless of the underlying program\u2019s copyright status. See Stern Electronics, Inc. v. Kaufman, 669 F.2d 852, 855 [213 USPQ 443] (2d Cir. 1982) (explaining that an audiovisual works copyright, rather than a copyright on the underlying program, extended greater protection to the sights and sounds generated by a computer video game because the same audiovisual display could be generated by different programs). Of course, the copyright protection that these displays enjoy extends only so far as their expression is protectable. Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc., 862 F.2d 204, 209 [9 USPQ2d 1322] (9th Cir. 1988). In this case, however, we are concerned not with a program\u2019s display, but the program itself, and then with only its non-literal components. In considering the copyrightability of these components, we must refer to venerable doctrines of copyright law.\n1) Idea vs. Expression Dichotomy\n\nIt is a fundamental principle of copyright law that a copyright does not protect an idea, but only the expression of the idea. See Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99 (1879); Mazer v. Stein, 347U.S. 201, 217 [100 USPQ 325] (1954). This axiom of common law has been incorporated into the governing statute. Section 102(b) of the act provides:\nIn no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\n17 U.S.C. Section 102(b) . See also House Report, at 5670 (\u201cCopyright does not preclude others from using ideas or information revealed by the author\u2019s work.\u201d).\nCongress made no special exception for computer programs. To the contrary, the legislative history explicitly states that copyright protects computer programs only \u201cto the extent that they incorporate authorship in programmer\u2019s expression of original ideas, as distinguished from the ideas themselves.\u201d Id. at 5667; see also id. at 5670 (\u201cSection 102(b) is intended . . . to make clear that the expression adopted by the programmer is the copyrightable element in a computer program, and that the actual processes or methods embodied in the program are not within the scope of copyright law.\u201d).\nSimilarly, the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (\u201cCONTU\u201d) established by Congress to survey the issues generated by the interrelationship of advancing technology and copyright law, seePub.L.93-573, Section 201, 88 Stat. 1873 (1974), recommended, inter alia, that the 1976 Copyright Act \u201cbeamended . . . to make it explicit that computer programs, to the extent that they embody the author\u2019s original creation, are proper subject matter for copyright.\u201d See National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works, Final Report 1 (1979) (hereinafter \u201cCONTU Report \u201c). To that end, Congress adopted CONTU\u2019s suggestions and amended the Copyright Act by adding, among other things, a provision to 17 U.S.C. Section 101 which defined the term \u201ccomputer program.\u201d SeePub.L. No. 96-517, Section 10(a), 94 Stat. <982 F.2d 704> 3028 (1980) . CONTU also \u201cconcluded that the idea-expression distinction should be used to determine which aspects of computer programs are copyrightable.\u201d Lotus Dev. Corp., 740 F.Supp. at 54 (citing CONTU Report, at 44) .\nDrawing the line between idea and expression is a tricky business. Judge Learned Hand noted that \u201c[n]obody has ever been able to fix that boundary, and nobody ever can.\u201d Nichols, 45 F.2d at 121 . Thirty years later his convictions remained firm. \u201cObviously, no principle can be stated as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the \u2018idea,\u2019 and has borrowed its \u2018expression,\u2019 \u201c Judge Hand concluded. \u201cDecisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc.\u201d Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 <23 USPQ2d 1251> F.2d 487, 489 [124 USPQ 154] (2d Cir. 1960).\nThe essentially utilitarian nature of a computer program further complicates the task of distilling its idea from its expression. See SAS Institute, 605 F. Supp. at 829 ; cf. Englund, at 893 . In order to describe both computational processes and abstract ideas, its content \u201ccombines creative and technical expression.\u201d See Spivack, at 755 . The variations of expression found in purely creative compositions, as opposed to those contained in utilitarian works, are not directed towards practical application. For example, a narration of Humpty Dumpty\u2019s demise, which would clearly be a creative composition, does not serve the same ends as, say, a recipe for scrambled eggs \u2013 which is a more process oriented text. Thus, compared to aesthetic works, computer programs hover even more closely to the elusive boundary line described in Section 102(b).\nThe doctrinal starting point in analyses of utilitarian works, is the seminal case of Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99 (1879) . In Baker,the Supreme Court faced the question of \u201cwhether the exclusive property in a system of bookkeeping can be claimed, under the law of copyright, by means of a book in which that system is explained?\u201d Id. at 101 . Selden had copyrighted a book that expounded a particular method of bookkeeping. The book contained lined pages with headings intended to illustrate the manner in which the system operated. Baker\u2019s accounting publication included ledger sheets that employed \u201csubstantially the same ruled lines and headings.\u201d Id .Selden\u2019s testator sued Baker for copyright infringement on the theory that the ledger sheets were protected by Selden\u2019s copyright.\nThe Supreme Court found nothing copyrightable in Selden\u2019s Bookkeeping system, and rejected his infringement claim regarding the ledger sheets. The Court held that:\nThe fact that the art described in the book by illustrations of lines and figures which are reproduced in practice in the application of the art, makes no difference. Those illustrations are the mere language employed by the author to convey his ideas more clearly. Had he used words of description instead of diagrams (which merely stand in the place of words), there could not be the slightest doubt that others, applying the art to practical use, might lawfully draw the lines and diagrams which were in the author\u2019s mind, and which he thus described by words in his book.\nThe copyright of a work on mathematical science cannot give to the author an exclusive right to the methods of operation which he propounds, or to the diagrams which he employs to explain them, so as to prevent an engineer from using them whenever occasion requires. Id. at 103 .\nTo the extent that an accounting text and a computer program are both \u201ca set of statements or instructions . . . to bring about a certain result,\u201d 17 U.S.C. Section 101 , they are roughly analogous. In the former case, the processes are ultimately conducted by human agency; in the latter, by electronic means. In either case, as already stated, the processes themselves are not protectable. But the holding in Baker goes farther. The Court concluded that those aspects of a work, which \u201cmust necessarily be used as incident to\u201d the idea, system or process that the work describes, are also not copyrightable. 101 U.S. at 104 . Selden\u2019s ledger sheets, therefore, enjoyed <982 F.2d 705> no copyright protection because they were \u201cnecessary incidents to\u201d the system of accounting that he described. Id.at 103 . From this reasoning, we conclude that those elements of a computer program that are necessarily incidental to its function are similarly unprotectable.\nWhile Baker v. Selden provides a sound analytical foundation, it offers scant guidance on how to separate idea or process from expression, and moreover, on how to further distinguish protectable expression from that expression which \u201cmust necessarily be used as incident to\u201d the work\u2019s underlying concept. In the context of computer programs, the Third Circuit\u2019s noted decision in Whelan has, thus far, been the most thoughtful attempt to accomplish these ends.\nThe court in Whelan faced substantially the same problem as is presented by this case. There, the defendant was accused of making off with the non-literal structure of the plaintiff\u2019s copyrighted dental lab management program, and employing it to create its own competitive version. In assessing whether there had been an infringement, the court had to determine which aspects of the programs involved were ideas, and which were expression. In separating the two, the court settled upon the following conceptual approach:\n[T]he line between idea and expression may be drawn with reference to the end sought to be achieved by the work in question. In other words, the purpose or function of a utilitarian work would be the work\u2019s idea, and everything that is not necessary to that purpose or function would be part of the expression of the idea . . . . Where there are various means of achieving the desired purpose, then the <23 USPQ2d 1252> particular means chosen is not necessary to the purpose; hence, there is expression, not idea. 797 F.2d at 1236 (citations omitted).\nThe \u201cidea\u201d of the program at issue in Whelan was identified by the court as simply \u201cthe efficient management of a dental laboratory.\u201d Id. at n. 28.\nSo far, in the courts, the Whelan rule has received a mixed reception. While some decisions have adopted its reasoning, see, e.g., Bull HN Information Sys., Inc. v. American Express Bank, Ltd., 1990 Copyright Law Dec. (CCH) Para. 26,555 at 23,278 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) ; Dynamic Solutions, Inc. v. Planning & Control, Inc., 1987 Copyright Law Dec. (CCH) Para. 26,062 at 20,912 (S.D.N.Y. 1987); Broderbund Software Inc. v. Unison World, Inc., 648 F. Supp. 1127, 1133 [231 USPQ 700] (N.D.Cal.1986), others have rejected it. See Plains Cotton Co-op v. Goodpasture Computer Service, Inc., 807 F.2d 1256, 1262 [1 USPQ2d 1635] (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 821 (1987); cf. Synercom Technology, Inc. v. University Computing Co., 462F.Supp. 1003, 1014 [199 USPQ 537] (N.D.Tex. 1978) (concluding that order and sequence of data on computer input formats was idea not expression).\nWhelan has fared even more poorly in the academic community, where its standard for distinguishing idea from expression has been widely criticized for being conceptually overbroad. See, e.g., Englund, at 881; Menell, at 1074, 1082 ; Kretschmer, at 837-39 ; Spivack, at 747-55 ; Thomas M. Gage, Note, Whelan Associates v. Jaslow Dental Laboratories: Copyright Protection for Computer Software Structure \u2013 What\u2019s the Purpose?, 1987 Wis. L. Rev. 859, 860-61 (1987). The leading commentator in the field has stated that, \u201c[t]he crucial flaw in [Whelan\u2019s] reasoning is that it assumes that only one \u2018idea,\u2019 in copyright law terms, underlies any computer program, and that once a separable idea can be identified, everything else must be expression.\u201d 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [F], at 13-62.34 . This criticism focuses not upon the program\u2019s ultimate purpose but upon the reality of its structural design. As we have already noted, a computer program\u2019s ultimate function or purpose is the composite result of interacting subroutines. Since each subroutine is itself a program, and thus, may be said to have its own \u201cidea,\u201d Whelan\u2019s general formulation that a program\u2019s overall purpose equates with the program\u2019s idea is descriptively inadequate.\nAccordingly, we think that Judge Pratt wisely declined to follow Whelan. See <982 F.2d 706> Computer Associates, 775 F.Supp. at 558-60 . In addition to noting the weakness in the Whelan definition of \u201cprogram-idea,\u201d mentioned above, Judge Pratt found that Whelan\u2019ssynonymous use of the terms \u201cstructure, sequence, and organization,\u201d see Whelan, 797 F.2d at 1224 n.1 , demonstrated a flawed understanding of a computer program\u2019s method of operation. See Computer Associates, 775 F.Supp. at 559-60 (discussing the distinction between a program\u2019s \u201cstatic structure\u201d and \u201cdynamic structure\u201d). Rightly, the district court found Whelan \u2018s rationale suspect because it is so closely tied to what can now be seen \u2013 with the passage of time \u2013 as the opinion\u2019s somewhat outdated appreciation of computer science.\n2) Substantial Similarity Test for Computer Program Structure: Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison\n\nWe think that Whelan\u2019s approach to separating idea from expression in computer programs relies too heavily on metaphysical distinctions and does not place enough emphasis on practical considerations. Cf. Apple Computer, 714 F.2d at 1253 (rejecting certain commercial constraints on programming as a helpful means of distinguishing idea from expression because they did \u201cnot enter into the somewhat metaphysical issue of whether particular ideas and expressions have merged\u201d). As the cases that we shall discuss demonstrate, a satisfactory answer to this problem cannot be reached by resorting, a priori, to philosophical first principals.\nAs discussed herein, we think that district courts would be well-advised to undertake a three-step procedure, based on the abstractions test utilized by the district court, in order to determine whether the non-literal elements of two or more computer programs are substantially similar. This approach breaks no new ground; rather, it draws on such familiar copyright doctrines as merger, scenes a faire, and public domain. In taking this approach, however, we are cognizant that computer technology is a dynamic field which can quickly outpace judicial decisionmaking. Thus, in cases where the technology in question does not allow for a literal application of the procedure we outline below, our opinion, should not be read to foreclose the district courts of our circuit from utilizing a modified version.\nIn ascertaining substantial similarity under this approach, a court would first break down the allegedly infringed program into its constituent structural parts. Then, by examining each of these parts for such things as incorporated ideas, expression that is necessarily incidental to those ideas, and elements that are taken from the public domain, a court would then be able to sift out <23 USPQ2d 1253> all non-protectable material. Left with a kernel, or possibly kernels, of creative expression after following this process of elimination, the court\u2019s last step would be to compare this material with the structure of an allegedly infringing program. The result of this comparison will determine whether the protectable elements of the programs at issue are substantially similar so as to warrant a finding of infringement. It will be helpful to elaborate a bit further.\nStep One: Abstraction\nAs the district court appreciated, see Computer Associates, 775 F. Supp. at 560 , the theoretic framework for analyzing substantial similarity expounded by Learned Hand in the Nichols case is helpful in the present context. In Nichols,we enunciated what has now become known as the \u201cabstractions\u201d test for separating idea from expression:\nUpon any work . . . a great number of patterns of increasing generality will fit equally well, as more and more of the incident is left out. The last may perhaps be no more than the most general statement of what the [work] is about, and at times might consist only of its title; but there is a point in this series of abstractions where they are no longer protected, since otherwise the [author] could prevent the use of his \u201cideas,\u201d to which, apart from their expression, his property is never extended.\nNichols, 45 F.2d at 121 .\nWhile the abstractions test was originally applied in relation to literary works such <982 F.2d 707> as novels and plays, it is adaptable to computer programs. In contrast to the Whelanapproach, the abstractions test \u201cimplicitly recognizes that any given work may consist of a mixture of numerous ideas and expressions.\u201d 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [F] at 13-62.34-63 .\nAs applied to computer programs, the abstractions test will comprise the first step in the examination for substantial similarity. Initially, in a manner that resembles reverse engineering on a theoretical plane, a court should dissect the allegedly copied program\u2019s structure and isolate each level of abstraction contained within it. This process begins with the code and ends with an articulation of the program\u2019s ultimate function. Along the way, it is necessary essentially to retrace and map each of the designer\u2019s steps \u2013 in the opposite order in which they were taken during the program\u2019s creation. See Background: Computer Program Design, supra.\nAs an anatomical guide to this procedure, the following description is helpful:\nAt the lowest level of abstraction, a computer program may be thought of in its entirety as a set of individual instructions organized into a hierarchy of modules. At a higher level of abstraction, the instructions in the lowest-level modules may be replaced conceptually by the functions of those modules. At progressively higher levels of abstraction, the functions of higher-level modules conceptually replace the implementations of those modules in terms of lower-level modules and instructions, until finally, one is left with nothing but the ultimate function of the program. . . . A program has structure at every level of abstraction at which it is viewed. At low levels of abstraction, a program\u2019s structure may be quite complex; at the highest level it is trivial.\nEnglund, at 897-98. Cf. Spivack, at 774.\nStep Two: Filtration\nOnce the program\u2019s abstraction levels have been discovered, the substantial similarity inquiry moves from the conceptual to the concrete. Professor Nimmer suggests, and we endorse, a \u201csuccessive filtering method\u201d for separating protectable expression from non-protectable material. See generally 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [F] . This process entails examining the structural components at each level of abstraction to determine whether their particular inclusion at that level was \u201cidea\u201d or was dictated by considerations of efficiency, so as to be necessarily incidental to that idea; required by factors external to the program itself; or taken from the public domain and hence is non-protectable expression. See also Kretschmer, at 844-45 (arguing that program features dictated by market externalities or efficiency concerns are unprotectable). The structure of any given program may reflect some, all, or none of these considerations. Each case requires its own fact specific investigation.\nStrictly speaking, this filtration serves \u201cthe purpose of defining the scope of plaintiff\u2019s copyright.\u201d Brown Bag Software v. Symantec Corp., No. 89-16239, slip op. 3719, 3738 [22 USPQ2d 1429] (9th Cir. April 7, 1992) (endorsing \u201canalytic dissection\u201d of computer programs in order to isolate protectable expression). By applying well developed doctrines of copyright law, it may ultimately leave behind a \u201ccore of protectable material.\u201d 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [F] [5], at 13-72 . Further explication of this second step may be helpful.\n(a) Elements Dictated by Efficiency.\n<23 USPQ2d 1254> The portion of Baker v. Selden, discussed earlier, which denies copyright protection to expression necessarily incidental to the idea being expressed, appears to be the cornerstone for what has developed into the doctrine of merger. See Morrissey v. Procter & Gamble Co., 379 F.2d 675, 678-79 [154 USPQ 193] (1st Cir. 1967) (relying on Baker for the proposition that expression embodying the rules of a sweepstakes contest was inseparable from the idea of the contest itself, and therefore were not protectable by copyright); see also Digital Communications, 659 F. Supp. at 457 . The doctrine\u2019s underlying principle is that \u201c[w]hen there is essentially only one way to express an idea, the idea and its expression are inseparable <982 F.2d 708> and copyright is no bar to copying that expression.\u201dConcrete Machinery Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc., 843 F.2d 600, 606 [6 USPQ 1357] (1st Cir. 1988). Under these circumstances, the expression is said to have \u201cmerged\u201d with the idea itself. In order not to confer a monopoly of the idea upon the copyright owner, such expression should not be protected. See Herbert Rosenthal <982 F.2d 709> Jewelry Corp. v. Kalpakian, 446 F.2d 738, 742 [170 USPQ 557] (9th Cir. 1971).\nCONTU recognized the applicability of the merger doctrine to computer programs. In its report to Congress it stated that:\n[C]opyrighted language may be copied without infringing when there is but a limited number of ways to express a given idea. . . . In the computer context, this means that when specific instructions, even though previously copyrighted, are the only and essential means of accomplishing a given task, their later use by another will not amount to infringement.\nCONTU Report at 20 . While this statement directly concerns only the application of merger to program code, that is, the textual aspect of the program, it reasonably suggests that the doctrine fits comfortably within the general context of computer programs.\nFurthermore, when one considers the fact that programmers generally strive to create programs \u201cthat meet the user\u2019s needs in the most efficient manner,\u201d Menell, at 1052 , the applicability of the merger doctrine to computer programs becomes compelling. In the context of computer program design, the concept of efficiency is akin to deriving the most concise logical proof or formulating the most succinct mathematical computation. Thus, the more efficient a set of modules are, the more closely they approximate the idea or process embodied in that particular aspect of the program\u2019s structure.\nWhile, hypothetically, there might be a myriad of ways in which a programmer may effectuate certain functions within a program, \u2013 i.e., express the idea embodied in a given subroutine \u2013 efficiency concerns may so narrow the practical range of choice as to make only one or two forms of expression workable options. See3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [F] [2], at 13-63 ; see also Whelan, 797 F.2d at 1243 n.43 (\u201cIt is true that for certain tasks there are only a very limited number of file structures available, and in such cases the structures might not be copyrightable . . .\u201d). Of course, not all program structure is informed by efficiency concerns. See Menell, at 1052 (besides efficiency, simplicity related to user accommodation has become a programming priority). It follows that in order to determine whether the merger doctrine precludes copyright protection to an aspect of a program\u2019s structure that is so oriented, a court must inquire \u201cwhether the use of this particular set of modules is necessary efficiently to implement that part of the program\u2019s process\u201d being implemented. Englund, at 902 . If the answer is yes, then the expression represented by the programmer\u2019s choice of a specific module or group of modules has merged with their underlying idea and is unprotected. Id.at 902-03 .\nAnother justification for linking structural economy with the application of the merger doctrine stems from a program\u2019s essentially utilitarian nature and the competitive forces that exist in the software marketplace. See Kretschmer, at 842. Working in tandem, these factors give rise to a problem of proof which merger helps to eliminate.\nEfficiency is an industry-wide goal. Since, as we have already noted, there may be only a limited number of efficient implementations for any given program task, it is quite possible that multiple programmers, working independently, will design the identical method employed in the allegedly infringed work. Of course, if this is the case, there is no copyright infringement. See Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co., 429 F.2d 1106, 1110 [166 USPQ 291] (9th Cir. 1970); Sheldon, 81 F.2d at 54 .\nUnder these circumstances, the fact that two programs contain the same efficient structure may as likely lead to an inference of independent creation as it does to one of copying. See 3 Nimmer Section 13.03[F] [2], at 13-65 ; cf. Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp., 446 F.2d at 741 (evidence of independent creation may stem from defendant\u2019s standing as a designer of previous similar works). Thus, since evidence of similarly efficient structure is not particularly probative of copying, it should be disregarded in the over <23 USPQ2d 1255> all substantial similarity analysis. See 3 Nimmer Section 13.03[F][2], at 13-65.\nWe find support for applying the merger doctrine in cases that have already addressed the question of substantial similarity in the context of computer program structure. Most recently, in Lotus Dev. Corp., 740 F. Supp. at 66 , the district court had before it a claim of copyright infringement relating to the structure of a computer spreadsheet program. The court observed that \u201cthe basic spreadsheet screen display that resembles a rotated \u2018L\u2019 . . ., if not present in every expression of such a program, is present in most expressions.\u201d Id . Similarly, the court found that \u201can essential detail present in most if not all expressions of an electronic spreadsheet \u2013 is the designation of a particular key that, when pressed, will invoke the menu command system.\u201d Id . Applying the merger doctrine, the court denied copyright protection to both program elements.\nIn Manufacturers Technologies, Inc. v. Cams, Inc., 706 F. Supp. 984, 995-99 [10 USPQ2d 1321] (D. Conn. 1989), the infringement claims stemmed from various alleged program similarities \u201cas indicated in their screen displays.\u201d Id. at 990 . Stressing efficiency concerns in the context of a merger analysis, the court determined that the program\u2019s method of allowing the user to navigate within the screen displays was not protectable because, in part, \u201cthe process or manner of navigating internally on any specific screen displays . . . is limited in the number of ways it may be simply achieved to facilitate user comfort.\u201d Id. at 995 . The court also found that expression contained in various screen displays (in the form of alphabetical and numerical columns), was not the proper subject of copyright protection because it was \u201cnecessarily incident to the idea [s]\u201d embodied in the displays. Id. at 996, 998 . Cf. Digital Communications, 659 F. Supp. at 460 (finding no merger and affording copyright protection to program\u2019s status screen display because \u201cmodes of expression chosen . . . are clearly not necessary to the idea of the status screen\u201d).\nWe agree with the approach taken in these decisions, and conclude that application of the merger doctrine in this setting is an effective way to eliminate non-protectable expression contained in computer programs.\n(b) Elements Dictated By External Factors\nWe have stated that where \u201cit is virtually impossible to write about a particular historical era or fictional theme without employing certain \u2018stock\u2019 or standard literary devices,\u201d such expression is not copyrightable. Hoehling v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 618 F.2d 972, 979 [205 USPQ 681] (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 841 [207 USPQ 1064] (1980). For example, the Hoehling case was an infringement suit stemming from several works on the Hindenberg disaster. There we concluded that similarities in representations of German beer halls, scenes depicting German greetings such as \u201cHeil Hitler,\u201d or the singing of certain German songs would not lead to a finding of infringement because they were \u201c \u2018indispensable, or at least standard, in the treatment of\u2019 \u201c life in Nazi Germany. Id . (quotingAlexander v. Haley, 460 F. Supp. 40, 45 [200 USPQ 239] (S.D.N.Y. 1978)). This is known as the scenes a faire doctrine, and like \u201cmerger,\u201d it has its analogous application to computer programs. Cf. Data East USA, 862 F.2d at 208 (applying scenes a faire to a home computer video game).\nProfessor Nimmer points out that \u201cin many instances it is virtually impossible to write a program to perform particular functions in a specific computing environment without employing standard techniques.\u201d 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [F] [3], at 13-65 . This is a result of the fact that a programmer\u2019s freedom of design choice is often circumscribed by extrinsic considerations such as (1) the mechanical specifications of the computer on which a particular program <982 F.2d 710> is intended to run; (2) compatibility requirements of other programs with which a program is designated to operate in conjunction; (3) computer manufacturers\u2019 design standards; (4) demands of the industry being serviced; and (5) widely accepted programming practices within the computer industry. Id. at 13-66-71 .\nCourts have already considered some of these factors in denying copyright protection to various elements of computer programs. In the Plains Cotton case, the Fifth Circuit refused to reverse the district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction against an alleged program infringer because, in part, \u201cmany of the similarities between the . . . programs [were] dictated by the externalities of the cotton market.\u201d 807 F.2d at 1262 .\nIn Manufacturers Technologies, the district court noted that the program\u2019s method of screen navigation \u201cis influenced by the type of hardware that the software is designed to be used on.\u201d 706 F.Supp. at 995 . Because, in part, \u201cthe functioning of the hardware package impact[ed]and constrain [ed] the type of navigational tools used in plaintiff\u2019s screen displays,\u201d the court denied copyright protection to that aspect of the program.Cf. Data East USA, 862 F.2d at 209 (reversing a district court\u2019s finding of audio-visual work infringement because, inter <23 USPQ2d 1256> alia, \u201cthe use of the Commodore computer for a karate game intended for home consumption is subject to various constraints inherent in the use of that computer\u201d).\nFinally, the district court in Q-Co Industries rested its holding on what, perhaps, most closely approximates a traditional scenes a fairerationale. There, the court denied copyright protection to four program modules employed in a teleprompter program. This decision was ultimately based upon the court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe same modules would be an inherent part of any prompting program.\u201d 625 F.Supp. at 616 .\nBuilding upon this existing case law, we conclude that a court must also examine the structural content of an allegedly infringed program for elements that might have been dictated by external factors.\n(c) Elements taken From the Public Domain\nClosely related to the non-protectability of scenes a faire, is material found in the public domain. Such material is free for the taking and cannot be appropriated by a single author even though it is included in a copyrighted work. See E.F. Johnson Co. v. Uniden Corp. of America,623 F.Supp. 1485, 1499 [228 USPQ 891] (D. Minn. 1985); see also Sheldon,81 F.2d at 54 . We see no reason to make an exception to this rule for elements of a computer program that have entered the public domain by virtue of freely accessible program exchanges and the like. See 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [F] ; see also Brown Bag Software, slip op. at 3732 (affirming the district court\u2019s finding that \u201c\u2018[p]laintiffs may not claim copyright protection of an . . . expression that is, if not standard, then commonplace in the computer software industry.\u2019\u201c). Thus, a court must also filter out this material from the allegedly infringed program before it makes the final inquiry in its substantial similarity analysis.\nStep Three: Comparison\nThe third and final step of the test for substantial similarity that we believe appropriate for non-literal program components entails a comparison. Once a court has sifted out all elements of the allegedly infringed program which are \u201cideas\u201d or are dictated by efficiency or external factors, or taken from the public domain, there may remain a core of protectable expression. In terms of a work\u2019s copyright value, this is the golden nugget. See Brown Bag Software, slip op. at 3738 . At this point, the court\u2019s substantial similarity inquiry focuses on whether the defendant copied any aspect of this protected expression, as well as an assessment of the copied portion\u2019s relative importance with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s overall program. See 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [F] ; Data East USA, 862 F.2d at 208 (\u201cTo determine whether similarities result from unprotectable expression, analytic dissection of similarities may be <982 F.2d 711> performed. If . . . all similarities in expression arise from use of common ideas, then no substantial similarity can be found.\u201d)\n3) Policy Considerations\n\nWe are satisfied that the three step approach we have just outlined not only comports with, but advances the constitutional policies underlying the copyright act. Since any method that tries to distinguish idea from expression ultimately impacts on the scope of copyright protection afforded to a particular type of work, \u201cthe line [it draws] must be a pragmatic one, which also keeps in consideration \u2018the preservation of the balance between competition and protection.\u2019 \u201c Apple Computer, 714 F.2d at 1253 (citation omitted).\nCA and some amici argue against the type of approach that we have set forth on the grounds that it will be a disincentive for future computer program research and development. At bottom, they claim that if programmers are not guaranteed broad copyright protection for their work, they will not invest the extensive time, energy and funds required to design and improve program structures. While they have a point, their argument cannot carry the day. The interest of the copyright law is not in simply conferring a monopoly on industrious persons, but in advancing the public welfare through rewarding artistic creativity, in a manner that permits the free use and development of non-protectable ideas and processes.\nIn this respect, our conclusion is informed by Justice Stewart\u2019s concise discussion of the principles that correctly govern the adaptation of the copyright law to new circumstances. In Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, he wrote:\nThe limited scope of the copyright holder\u2019s statutory monopoly, like the limited copyright duration required by the Constitution, reflects a balance of competing claims upon the public interest: Creative work is to be encouraged and rewarded, but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts.\nThe immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an \u201cauthor\u2019s <23 USPQ2d 1257> \u201d creative labor. But the ultimate aim is, by this incentive, to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good. . . . When technological change has rendered its literal terms ambiguous, the Copyright Act must be construed in light of this basic purpose.\n422 U.S. 151, 156 [186 USPQ 65] (1975) (citations and footnotes omitted).\nRecently, the Supreme Court has emphatically reiterated that \u201c[t]he primary objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of authors. . . .\u201dFeist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., 111 S. Ct. 1282, 1290 [18 USPQ2d 1275] (1991) (emphasis added). While the Feist decision deals primarily with the copyrightability of purely factual compilations, its underlying tenets apply to much of the work involved in computer programming. Feist put to rest the \u201csweat of the brow\u201d doctrine in copyright law. Id. at 1295 . The rationale of that doctrine \u201cwas that copyright was a reward for the hard work that went into compiling facts.\u201d Id. at 1291 . The Court flatly rejected this justification for extending copyright protection, noting that it \u201ceschewed the most fundamental axiom of copyright law \u2013 that no one may copyright facts or ideas.\u201d Id .\nFeist teaches that substantial effort alone cannot confer copyright status on an otherwise uncopyrightable work. As we have discussed, despite the fact that significant labor and expense often goes into computer program flow-charting and debugging, that process does not always result in inherently protectable expression. Thus, Feist implicitly undercuts the Whelan rationale, \u201cwhich allow [ed] copyright protection beyond the literal computer code . . . [in order to] provide the proper incentive for programmers by protecting their most valuable efforts.\u201d Whelan, 797 F.2d at 1237 (footnote omitted). We note that Whelan was decided prior to Feist when the \u201csweat of the brow\u201d doctrine still had vitality. In view of the Supreme <982 F.2d 712> Court\u2019s recent holding, however, we must reject the legal basis of CA\u2019s disincentive argument.\nFurthermore, we are unpersuaded that the test we approve today will lead to the dire consequences for the computer program industry that plaintiff and some amici predict. To the contrary, serious students of the industry have been highly critical of the sweeping scope of copyright protection engendered by the Whelan rule, in that it \u201cenables first comers to \u2018lock up\u2019 basic programming techniques as implemented in programs to perform particular tasks.\u201d Menell, at 1087 ; see also Spivack, at 765 (Whelan\u201cresults in an inhibition of creation by virtue of the copyright owner\u2019s quasi-monopoly power\u201d).\nTo be frank, the exact contours of copyright protection for non-literal program structure are not completely clear. We trust that as future cases are decided, those limits will become better defined. Indeed, it may well be that the Copyright Act serves as a relatively weak barrier against public access to the theoretical interstices behind a program\u2019s source and object codes. This results from the hybrid nature of a computer program, which, while it is literary expression, is also a highly functional, utilitarian component in the larger process of computing.\nGenerally, we think that copyright registration \u2013 with its indiscriminating availability \u2013 is not ideally suited to deal with the highly dynamic technology of computer science. Thus far, many of the decisions in this area reflect the courts\u2019 attempt to fit the proverbial square peg in a round hole. The district court, see Computer Associates, 775 F. Supp. at 560 , and at least one commentator has suggested that patent registration, with its exacting up-front novelty and non-obviousness requirements, might be the more appropriate rubric of protection for intellectual property of this kind. SeeRandell M. Whitmeyer, Comment, A Plea for Due Processes: Defining the Proper Scope of Patent Protection for Computer Software, 85 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1103, 1123-25 (1991) ; see also Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int\u2019l, Inc., 788 F. Supp. 78, ___ [22 USPQ2d 1641] (D. Mass. 1992) (discussing the potentially supplemental relationship between patent and copyright protection in the context of computer programs). In any event, now that more than 12 years have passed since CONTU issued its final report, the resolution of this specific issue could benefit from further legislative investigation \u2013 perhaps a CONTU II.\nIn the meantime, Congress has made clear that computer programs are literary works entitled to copyright protection. Of course, we shall abide by these instructions, but in so doing we must not impair the overall integrity of copyright law. While incentive based arguments in favor of broad copyright protection are perhaps attractive from a pure policy perspective, see Lotus Dev. Corp., 740 F. Supp. at 58 , ultimately, they have a corrosive effect on certain fundamental tenets of copyright doctrine. If the test we have outlined results in narrowing the scope of protection, as we expect it will, that result flows from applying, in accordance with Congressional intent, long-standing principles of copyright law to computer programs. Of course, our decision is also informed by our <23 USPQ2d 1258> concern that these fundamental principles remain undistorted.\nB. The District Court Decision\n\nWe turn now to our review of the district court\u2019s decision in this particular case. At the outset, we must address CA\u2019s claim that the district court erred by relying too heavily on the court appointed expert\u2019s \u201cpersonal opinions on the factual and legal issues before the court.\u201d\n1. Use of Expert Evidence in Determining Substantial Similarity Between Computer Programs\n\nPursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 706, and with the consent of both Altai and CA, Judge Pratt appointed and relied upon Dr. Randall Davis of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as the court\u2019s own expert witness on the issue of substantial similarity. Dr. Davis submitted a comprehensive written report that analyzed the various aspects of the computer programs <982 F.2d 713> at issue and evaluated the parties\u2019 expert evidence. At trial, Dr. Davis was extensively cross-examined by both CA and Altai.\nThe well-established general rule in this circuit has been to limit the use of expert opinion in determining whether works at issue are substantially similar. As a threshold matter, expert testimony may be used to assist the fact finder in ascertaining whether the defendant had copied any part of the plaintiff\u2019s work. See Arnstein v. Porter, 154 F.2d 464, 468 [68 USPQ 288] (2d Cir. 1946). To this end, \u201cthe two works are to be compared in their entirety . . . [and] in making such comparison resort may properly be made to expert analysis. . . .\u201d 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [E], at 13-62.16 .\nHowever, once some amount of copying has been established, it remains solely for the trier-of-fact to determine whether the copying was \u201cillicit,\u201d that is to say, whether the \u201cdefendant took from plaintiff\u2019s works so much of what is pleasing to [lay observers] who comprise the audience for whom such [works are] composed, that defendant wrongfully appropriated something which belongs to the plaintiff.\u201d Arnstein, 154 F.2d at 473 . Since the test for illicit copying is based upon the response of ordinary lay observers, expert testimony is thus \u201cirrelevant\u201d and not permitted. Id.at 468, 473 . We have subsequently described this method of inquiry as \u201cmerely an alternative way of formulating the issue of substantial similarity.\u201dIdeal Toy Corp. v. Fab-Lu Ltd. (Inc.), 360 F.2d 1021, 1023 n.2 [149 USPQ 800] (2d Cir. 1966).\nHistorically, Arnstein\u2019s ordinary observer standard had its roots in \u201can attempt to apply the \u2018reasonable person\u2019 doctrine as found in other areas of the law to copyright.\u201d 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [E] [2], at 13-62. 10-11 . That approach may well have served its purpose when the material under scrutiny was limited to art forms readily comprehensible and generally familiar to the average lay person. However, in considering the extension of the rule to the present case, we are reminded of Holmes\u2019 admonition that, \u201c[t]he life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.\u201d O. W. Holmes, Jr., THE COMMON LAW 1 (1881) .\nThus, in deciding the limits to which expert opinion may be employed in ascertaining the substantial similarity of computer programs, we cannot disregard the highly complicated and technical subject matter at the heart of these claims. Rather, we recognize the reality that computer programs are likely to be somewhat impenetrable by lay observers \u2013 whether they be judges or juries \u2013 and, thus, seem to fall outside the category of works contemplated by those who engineered the Arnstein test. Cf. Dawson v. Hinshaw Music, Inc., 905 F.2d 731, 737 [15 USPQ2d 1132] (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 111 S.Ct. 511 (1990) (\u201cdeparture from the lay characterization is warranted only where the intended audience possesses \u2018specialized expertise\u2019 \u201c). As Judge Pratt correctly observed:\nIn the context of computer programs, many of the familiar tests of similarity prove to be inadequate, for they were developed historically in the context of artistic and literary, rather than utilitarian, works.\nComputer Associates, 775 F.Supp. at 558 .\nIn making its finding on substantial similarity with respect to computer programs, we believe that the trier of fact need not be limited by the strictures of its own lay perspective. See Dawson, 905 F.2d at 735 ; Whelan, 797 F.2d at 1233 ; Broderbund, 648 F.Supp. at 1136 (stating in dictum : \u201can integrated test involving expert testimony and analytic dissection may well be the wave of the future in this area\u201d); Brown Bag Software, slip op. at 3743-44 (Sneed, J., concurring); see also 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [E] [4] ; but see Brown Bag Software, slip op. at 3736-37 (applying the \u201cordinary reasonable person\u201d standard in substantial similarity test for computer programs). Rather, we leave it to the discretion of the district court to decide to what extent, if any, expert opinion, regarding the highly technical nature of computer programs, is warranted in a given case.<23 USPQ2d 1259>\nIn so holding, we do not intend to disturb the traditional role of lay observers in judging <982 F.2d 714> substantial similarity in copyright cases that involve the aesthetic arts, such as music, visual works or literature.\nIn this case, Dr. Davis\u2019 opinion was instrumental in dismantling the intricacies of computer science so that the court could formulate and apply an appropriate rule of law. While Dr. Davis\u2019 report and testimony undoubtedly shed valuable light on the subject matter of the litigation, Judge Pratt remained, in the final analysis, the trier of fact. The district court\u2019s use of the expert\u2019s assistance, in the context of this case, was entirely appropriate.\n2. Evidentiary Analysis\n\nThe district court had to determine whether Altai\u2019s OSCAR 3.5 program was substantially similar to CA\u2019s ADAPTER. We note that Judge Pratt\u2019s method of analysis effectively served as a road map for our own, with one exception \u2013 Judge Pratt filtered out the non-copyrightable aspects of OSCAR 3.5 rather than those found in ADAPTER, the allegedly infringed program. We think that our approach \u2013 i.e., filtering out the unprotected aspects of an allegedly infringed program and then comparing the end product to the structure of the suspect program \u2013 is preferable, and therefore believe that district courts should proceed in this manner in future cases.\nWe opt for this strategy because, in some cases, the defendant\u2019s program structure might contain protectable expression and/or other elements that are not found in the plaintiff\u2019s program. Since it is extraneous to the allegedly copied work, this material would have no bearing on any potential substantial similarity between the two programs. Thus, its filtration would be wasteful and unnecessarily time consuming. Furthermore, by focusing the analysis on the infringing rather than on the infringed material, a court may mistakenly place too little emphasis on a quantitatively small misappropriation which is, in reality, a qualitatively vital aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s protectable expression.\nThe fact that the district court\u2019s analysis proceeded in the reverse order, however, had no material impact on the outcome of this case. Since Judge Pratt determined that OSCAR effectively contained no protectable expression whatsoever, the most serious charge that can be levelled against him is that he was overly thorough in his examination.\nThe district court took the first step in the analysis set forth in this opinion when it separated the program by levels of abstraction. The district court stated:\nAs applied to computer software programs, this abstractions test would progress in order of \u201cincreasing generality\u201d from object code, to source code, to parameter lists, to services required, to general outline. In discussing the particular similarities, therefore, we shall focus on these levels.\nComputer Associates, 775 F. Supp. at 560 . While the facts of a different case might require that a district court draw a more particularized blueprint of a program\u2019s overall structure, this description is a workable one for the case at hand.\nMoving to the district court\u2019s evaluation of OSCAR 3.5\u2019s structural components, we agree with Judge Pratt\u2019s systematic exclusion of non-protectable expression. With respect to code, the district court observed that after the rewrite of OSCAR 3.4 to OSCAR 3.5, \u201cthere remained virtually no lines of code that were identical to ADAPTER.\u201d Id. at 561. Accordingly, the court found that the code \u201cpresent [ed] no similarity at all.\u201d Id. at 562.\nNext, Judge Pratt addressed the issue of similarity between the two programs\u2019 parameter lists and macros. He concluded that, viewing the conflicting evidence most favorably to CA, it demonstrated that \u201conly a few of the lists and macros were similar to protected elements in ADAPTER; the others were either in the public domain or dictated by the functional demands of the program.\u201d Id. As discussed above, functional elements and elements taken from the public domain do not qualify for copyright protection. With respect to the few remaining parameter lists and macros, the district court could reasonably conclude that they did not warrant a <982 F.2d 715> finding of infringement given their relative contribution to the overall program. See Warner Bros., Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., Inc., 720 F.2d 231, 242 [222 USPQ 101] (2d Cir. 1983) (discussing de minimis exception which allows for literal copying of a small and usually insignificant portion of the plaintiff\u2019s work); 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [F] [5], at 13-74 . In any event, the district court reasonably found that, for lack of persuasive evidence, CA failed to meet its burden of proof on whether the macros and parameter lists at issue were substantially similar. See Computer Associates, 775 F. Supp. at 562 .\nThe district court also found that the overlap exhibited between the list of services required for both ADAPTER and OSCAR 3.5 was \u201cdeterminated by the demands of the operating system and of the applications program to which it [was] to be linked <23 USPQ2d 1260> through ADAPTER or OSCAR.\u201d Id . In other words, this aspect of the program\u2019s structure was dictated by the nature of other programs with which it was designed to interact and, thus, is not protected by copyright.\nFinally, in his infringement analysis, Judge Pratt accorded no weight to the similarities between the two programs\u2019 organizational charts, \u201cbecause [the charts were] so simple and obvious to anyone exposed to the operation of the program [s].\u201d Id . CA argues that the district court\u2019s action in this regard \u201cis not consistent with copyright law\u201d \u2013 that \u201cobvious\u201d expression is protected, and that the district court erroneously failed to realize this. However, to say that elements of a work are \u201cobvious,\u201d in the manner in which the district court used the word, is to say that they \u201cfollow naturally from the work\u2019s theme rather than from the author\u2019s creativity.\u201d 3 Nimmer Section 13.03 [F] [3], at 13-65 . This is but one formulation of the scenes a faire doctrine, which we have already endorsed as a means of weeding out unprotectable expression.\nCA argues, at some length, that many of the district court\u2019s factual conclusions regarding the creative nature of its program\u2019s components are simply wrong. Of course, we are limited in our review of factual findings to setting aside only those that we determine are clearly erroneous. See Fed. R. Civ.P. 52 . Upon a thorough review of the voluminous record in this case, which is comprised of conflicting testimony and other highly technical evidence, we discern no error on the part of Judge Pratt, let alone clear error.\nSince we accept Judge Pratt\u2019s factual conclusions and the results of his legal analysis, we affirm his dismissal of CA\u2019s copyright infringement claim based upon OSCAR 3.5. We emphasize that, like all copyright infringement cases, those that involve computer programs are highly fact specific. The amount of protection due structural elements, in any given case, will vary according to the protectable expression found to exist within the program at issue.\nII. Trade Secret Preemption\n\nAs part of its claim for relief, CA alleged that Altai had misappropriated the trade secrets contained in its ADAPTER program. Prior to trial, while the proceedings were still before Judge Mishler, Altai moved for summary judgment on CA\u2019s trade secret misappropriation claim. Altai argued that section 301 of the Copyright Act had preempted CA\u2019s state law cause of action as it applied in this case. Judge Mishler denied Altai\u2019s motion, reasoning that \u201c[t]he elements of the tort of appropriation of trade secrets through the breach of contract or confidence by an employee are not the same as the elements of a claim of copyright infringement.\u201d Computer Associates, 775 F. Supp. at 563. [Note: The Second Circuit, upon rehearing, replaced the text reported in 23 USPQ2d 1241 with the text below.]\nThe parties addressed the preemption issue again, both in pre-and post-trial briefs. Judge Pratt then reconsidered and reversed Judge Mishler\u2019s earlier ruling. The district court concluded that CA\u2019s trade secret claims were preempted because \u201cCA \u2013 which is the master of its own case \u2013 has pleaded and proven facts which establish that one act constituted both copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets [namely, the] copying <982 F.2d 716> of ADAPTER into OSCAR 3.4 . . .\u201d Computer Assocs., 775 F. Supp. at 565.\nIn our original opinion, Computer Assocs. Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 14305 (2d Cir. 1992), we affirmed Judge Pratt\u2019s decision. CA petitioned for rehearing on this issue. In its petition for rehearing, CA brought to our attention portions of the record below that were not included in the appendix on appeal. CA argued that these documents, along with Judge Mishler\u2019s disposition of Altai\u2019s motion to dismiss and for summary judgment, established that CA advanced non-preempted trade secret misappropriation claims before both Judge Mishler and Judge Pratt. CA further contended that Judge Pratt failed to consider its theory that Altai was liable for wrongful acquisition of CA\u2019s trade secrets through Arney. Upon reconsideration, we have granted the petition for rehearing, withdrawn our initial opinion, and conclude in this amended opinion that the district court\u2019s preemption ruling on CA\u2019s trade secret claims should be vacated. We accordingly vacate the judgment of the district court on this point and remand CA\u2019s trade secret claims for a determination on the merits.\nA. General Law of Copyright Preemption Regarding Trade Secrets and Computer Programs\n\nCongress carefully designed the statutory framework of federal copyright preemption. In order to insure that the enforcement of these rights remains solely within the federal domain, section 301(a) of the Copyright Act expressly preempts\nall legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section 106 in works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression and come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by sections 102 and 103 . . .\n17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(a). This sweeping displacement of state law is, however, limited by section 301(b), which provides, in relevant part, that\nnothing in this title annuls or limits any rights or remedies under the common law or statutes of any State with respect to . . . activities violating legal or equitable rights that are not equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by section 106. . . .\n17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(b)(3). Section 106, in turn, affords a copyright owner the exclusive right to: (1) reproduce the copyrighted work; (2) prepare derivative works; (3) distribute copies of the work by sale or otherwise; and, with respect to certain artistic works, (4) perform the work publicly; and (5) display the work publicly. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(1)-(5).\nSection 301 thus preempts only those state law rights that \u201cmay be abridged by an act which, in and of itself, would infringe one of the exclusive rights\u201d provided by federal copyright law. See Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 723 F.2d 195, 200 (2d Cir. 1983), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 471 U.S. 539, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588, 105 S. Ct. 2218 (1985). But if an \u201cextra element\u201d is \u201crequired instead of or in addition to the acts of reproduction, performance, distribution or display, in order to constitute a state-created cause of action, then the right does not lie \u2018within the general scope of copyright,\u2019 and there is no preemption.\u201d 1 Nimmer \u00a7 1.01[B], at 1-14-15; see also Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc., 723 F.2d at 200 (where state law right \u201cis predicated upon an act incorporating elements beyond mere reproduction or the like, the [federal and state] rights are not equivalent\u201d and there is no preemption).\nA state law claim is not preempted if the \u201cextra element\u201d changes the \u201cnature of the action so that it is qualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim.\u201d Mayer v. Josiah Wedgwood & Sons, Ltd., 601 F. Supp. 1523, 1535 (S.D.N.Y. 1985); see Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc., 723 F.2d at 201. To determine whether a claim meets this standard, we must determine \u201cwhat plaintiff seeks to protect, the theories in which the matter is thought to be protected and the rights sought to be enforced.\u201d 1 Roger M. Milgrim, Milgrim on Trade Secrets <982 F.2d 717> \u00a7 2.06A[3], at 2-150 (1992) (hereinafter \u201cMilgrim\u201d). An action will not be saved from preemption by elements such as awareness or intent, which alter \u201cthe action\u2019s scope but not its nature . . .\u201d Mayer, 601 F. Supp. at 1535.\nFollowing this \u201cextra element\u201d test, we have held that unfair competition and misappropriation claims grounded solely in the copying of a plaintiff\u2019s protected expression are preempted by section 301. See, e.g., Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc., 784 F.2d 44, 53 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 90 L. Ed. 2d 721, 106 S. Ct. 2278 (1986); Warner Bros. Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos., 720 F.2d 231, 247 (2d Cir. 1983);Durham Indus., Inc. v. Tomy Corp., 630 F.2d 905, 919 & n. 15 (2d Cir. 1980). We also have held to be preempted a tortious interference with contract claim grounded in the impairment of a plaintiff\u2019s right under the Copyright Act to publish derivative works. See Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc., 723 F.2d at 201.\nHowever, many state law rights that can arise in connection with instances of copyright infringement satisfy the extra element test, and thus are not preempted by section 301. These include unfair competition claims based upon breach of confidential relationship, breach of fiduciary duty and trade secrets. Balboa Ins. Co. v. Trans Global Equities, 218 Cal. App. 3d 1327, 1339-53, 267 Cal. Rptr. 787, 793-803 (Ct. App. 3rd Dist.), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 347, 112 L. Ed. 2d 311 (1990).\nTrade secret protection, the branch of unfair competition law at issue in this case, remains a \u201cuniquely valuable\u201d weapon in the defensive arsenal of computer programmers. See 1 Milgrim \u00a7 2.06A[5][c], at 2-172.4. Precisely because trade secret doctrine protects the discovery of ideas, processes, and systems which are explicitly precluded from coverage under copyright law, courts and commentators alike consider it a necessary and integral part of the intellectual property protection extended to computer programs. See id.; Integrated Cash Management Servs., Inc. v. Digital Transactions, Inc., 920 F.2d 171, 173 (2d Cir. 1990) (while plaintiff withdrew copyright infringement claim for misappropriation of computer program, relief for theft of trade secret sustained); Healthcare Affiliated Servs., Inc. v. Lippany, 701 F. Supp. 1142, 1152-55 (W.D.Pa. 1988) (finding likelihood of success on trade secret claim, but not copyright claim); Q-Co Indus., Inc., 625 F. Supp. at 616-18 (finding likelihood of success on trade secret claim, but no merit to copyright claim); Kretschmer, at 847-49.\nThe legislative history of section 301 states that \u201cthe evolving common law rights of . . . trade secrets . . . would remain unaffected as long as the causes of action contain elements, such as . . . a breach of trust or confidentiality, that are different in kind from copyright infringement.\u201d House Report, at 5748. Congress did not consider the term \u201cmisappropriation\u201d to be \u201cnecessarily synonymous with copyright infringement,\u201d or to serve as the talisman of preemption. Id.\nTrade secret claims often are grounded upon a defendant\u2019s breach of a duty of trust or confidence to the plaintiff through improper disclosure of confidential material. See, e.g., Mercer v. C.A. Roberts Co., 570 F.2d 1232, 1238 (5th Cir. 1978); Brignoli v. Balch Hardy and Scheinman, Inc., 645 F. Supp. 1201, 1205 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). The defendant\u2019s breach of duty is the gravamen of such trade secret claims, and supplies the \u201cextra element\u201d that qualitatively distinguishes such trade secret causes of action from claims for copyright infringement that are based solely upon copying. See, e.g., Warrington Assoc., Inc. v. Real-Time Eng\u2019g Sys., Inc., 522 F. Supp. 367, 369 (N.D. Ill. 1981); Brignoli, 645 F. Supp. at 1205; see also generally Balboa Ins. Co., 218 Cal. App. 3d at 1346-50, 267 Cal. Rptr. at 798-802 (reviewing cases).\nB. Preemption in this Case\n\nThe district court stated that:\nWere CA\u2019s [trade secret] allegations premised on a theory of illegal acquisition of a trade secret, a charge that might have been alleged against Arney, who is not a defendant in this case, the <982 F.2d 718> preemption analysis might be different, for there seems to be no corresponding right guaranteed to copyright owners by \u00a7 106 of the copyright act.\nComputer Assocs., 775 F. Supp. at 565. However, the court concluded that CA\u2019s trade secret claims were not grounded in a theory that Altai violated a duty of confidentiality to CA. Rather, Judge Pratt stated that CA proceeded against Altai solely \u201con a theory that the misappropriation took place by Altai\u2019s use of ADAPTER \u2013 the same theory as the copyright infringement count.\u201d Id. The district court reasoned that \u201cthe right to be free from trade secret misappropriation through \u2018use\u2019, and the right to exclusive reproduction and distribution of a copyrighted work are not distinguishable.\u201d Id. Because he concluded that there was no qualitative difference between the elements of CA\u2019s state law trade secret claims and a claim for federal copyright infringement, Judge Pratt ruled that CA\u2019s trade secret claims were preempted by section 301.\nWe agree with CA that the district court failed to address fully the factual and theoretical bases of CA\u2019s trade secret claims. The district court relied upon the fact that Arney \u2013 not Altai \u2013 allegedly breached a duty to CA of confidentiality by stealing secrets from CA and incorporating those secrets into OSCAR 3.4. However, under a wrongful acquisition theory based on Restatement (First) of Torts \u00a7 757 (1939), Williams and Altai may be liable for violating CA\u2019s right of confidentiality. Section 757 states in relevant part:\nOne who discloses or uses another\u2019s trade secret, without a privilege to do so, is liable to another if . . . (c) he learned the secret from a third person with notice of the fact that it was a secret and that the third person discovered it by improper means or that the third person\u2019s disclosure of it was otherwise a breach of his duty to the other . . .\nActual notice is not required for such a third party acquisition claim; constructive notice is sufficient. A defendant is on constructive notice when, \u201cfrom the information which he has, a reasonable man would infer [a breach of confidence], or if, under the circumstances, a reasonable man would be put on inquiry and an inquiry pursued with reasonable intelligence and diligence would disclose the [breach].\u201d Id., comment 1; Metallurgical Indus., Inc. v. Fourtek, Inc., 790 F.2d 1195, 1204 (5th Cir. 1986); Vantage Point, Inc. v. Parker Bros., Inc., 529 F. Supp. 1204, 1210 n.2 (E.D.N.Y. 1981), aff\u2019d, 697 F.2d 301 (2d Cir. 1982); see also Rohm and Haas Co. v. Adco Chem. Co., 689 F.2d 424, 431 (3rd Cir. 1982) (\u201cDefendants never asked where the \u2018Harvey process\u2019 had come from. Defendants therefore were charged \u2018with whatever knowledge such inquiry would have led to.\u2019\u201c) (citation omitted); Colgate-Palmolive Co. v. Carter Prods., Inc., 230 F.2d 855, 864 (4th Cir.) (per curiam) (defendant \u201c\u2018must have known by the exercise of fair business principles\u2019\u201c that its employee\u2019s work was covered by an agreement not to disclose) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 843, 1 L. Ed. 2d 59, 77 S. Ct. 43 (1956); 1 Milgrim \u00a7 5.04[2][c].\nWe agree with the district court that New Jersey\u2019s governing governmental interest choice of law analysis directs the application of Texas law to CA\u2019s trade secret misappropriation claim. See Computer Assocs., 775 F. Supp. at 566. Texas law recognizes trade secret misappropriation claims grounded in the reasoning of Restatement section 757(c), see, e.g., Fourtek, 790 F.2d at 1204, and the facts alleged by CA may well support such a claim.\nIt is undisputed that, when Arney stole the ADAPTER code and incorporated it into his design of OSCAR 3.4, he breached his confidentiality agreement with CA. The district court noted that while such action might constitute a valid claim against Arney, CA is the named defendant in this lawsuit. Additionally, the district court found, as a matter of fact, that \u201cno one at Altai, other than Arney, knew that Arney had the ADAPTER code . . .\u201d Computer Assocs., 775 F. Supp. at 554. However, the district court did not consider fully Altai\u2019s potential liability for improper trade secret acquisition. It did not consider the question of Altai\u2019s trade secret liability <982 F.2d 719> in connection with OSCAR 3.4 under a constructive notice theory, or Altai\u2019s potential liability under an actual notice theory in connection with OSCAR 3.5.\nThe district court found that, prior to CA\u2019s bringing suit, Altai was not on actual notice of  Arney\u2019s theft of trade secrets, and incorporation of those secrets into OSCAR 3.4. However, by virtue of Williams\u2019 close relationship with Arney, Williams\u2019 general familiarity with CA\u2019s programs (having once been employed by CA himself), and the fact that Arney used the ADAPTER program in an office at Altai adjacent to Williams during a period in which he had frequent contact with Williams regarding the OSCAR/VSE project, Williams (and through him Altai) may well have been on constructive notice of Arney\u2019s breach of his duty of confidentiality toward CA. The district court did not address whether Altai was on constructive notice, thereby placing it under a duty of inquiry; rather the court\u2019s finding that only Arney affirmatively knew of the theft of CA\u2019s trade secrets and incorporation of those secrets into OSCAR 3.4 simply disposed of the issue of actual notice in connection with the creation of OSCAR 3.4. CA\u2019s claim of liability based on constructive notice, never considered in the district court\u2019s opinion, must be determined on remand.\nWith respect to actual notice, it is undisputed that CA\u2019s first complaint, filed in August 1988, informed Altai of Arney\u2019s trade secret violations in connection with the creation of OSCAR 3.4. The first complaint alleged that Arney assisted in the development of ADAPTER, thereby obtaining knowledge of CA\u2019s related trade secrets. It also alleged that Altai misappropriated CA\u2019s trade secrets by incorporating them into ZEKE.\nIn response to CA\u2019s complaint, Altai rewrote OSCAR 3.4, creating OSCAR 3.5. While we agree with the district court that OSCAR 3.5 did not contain any expression protected by copyright, it may nevertheless still have embodied many of CA\u2019s trade secrets that Arney brought with him to Altai. Since Altai\u2019s rewrite was conducted with full knowledge of Arney\u2019s prior misappropriation, in breach of his duty of confidentiality, it follows that OSCAR 3.5 was created with actual knowledge of trade secret violations. Thus, with regard to OSCAR 3.5, CA has a viable trade secret claim against Altai that must be considered by the district court on remand. This claim is grounded in Altai\u2019s alleged use of CA\u2019s trade secrets in the creation of OSCAR 3.5, while on actual notice of Arney\u2019s theft of trade secrets and incorporation of those secrets into OSCAR 3.4. The district court correctly stated that a state law claim based solely upon Altai\u2019s \u201cuse\u201d, by copying, of ADAPTER\u2019s non-literal elements could not satisfy the governing \u201cextra element\u201d test, and would be preempted by section 301. However, where the use of copyrighted expression is simultaneously the violation of a duty of confidentiality established by state law, that extra element renders the state right qualitatively distinct from the federal right, thereby foreclosing preemption under section 301.\nWe are also convinced that CA adequately pled a wrongful acquisition claim before Judge Mishler and Judge Pratt. In ruling that CA failed to properly plead a non-preempted claim, Judge Pratt relied heavily upon two allegations in CA\u2019s amended complaint. Id. at 563-64. They read as follows:\nP 57. By reason of the facts stated in paragraph 39 and by copying from CA-SCHEDULER into ZEKE, ZACK and ZEBB the various elements stated in paragraphs 39-51, 54 and 55, defendant Altai has infringed [CA\u2019s] copyright in CA-SCHEDULER.\n* * *\nP 73. Defendant\u2019s incorporation into its ZEKE, ZACK and ZEBB programs of the various elements contained in the ADAPTER component of [CA\u2019s] CA-SCHEDULER program as set out in paragraphs 39-51, 54 and 55 constitutes the willful misappropriation of the proprietary property and trade secrets of plaintiff [CA].\n<982 F.2d 720> From these pleadings, Judge Pratt concluded that the very same act, i.e., Altai\u2019s copying of various elements of CA\u2019s program, was the basis for both CA\u2019s copyright infringement and trade secret claims. See id. at 564. We agree with Judge Pratt that CA\u2019s allegations are somewhat inartfully stated. However, when taken together, the terms \u201cincorporation\u201d and \u201cmisappropriation\u201d in paragraph 73 above suggest to us an act of a qualitatively different nature than the infringement pled in paragraph 57. House Report, at 5748 (\u201c\u2018misappropriation\u2019 is not necessarily synonymous with copyright infringement\u201d).\nIn support of our reading, we note that paragraphs 65-75 of CA\u2019s amended complaint alleged facts that reasonably comprise the elements of a wrongful acquisition of trade secrets claim. CA averred that, while he was employed at CA, Arney learned CA\u2019s trade secrets regarding the ADAPTER program. CA further alleged that after Arney went to work for Altai, Altai misappropriated those trade secrets by incorporating CA\u2019s ADAPTER program into its own product. Finally, CA claimed that the trade secret misappropriation was carried out \u201cin a willful, wanton and reckless manner in disregard of [CA\u2019s] rights.\u201d In other words, Altai could have reasonably inferred from CA\u2019s allegations that CA\u2019s claim, in part, rested on Williams\u2019 \u201cwanton and reckless\u201d behavior in the face of constructive notice.\nIn addition, while responding to Altai\u2019s preemption argument in its motion to dismiss and for summary judgment, CA specifically argued in its brief to Judge Mishler that \u201cit can easily be inferred that Mr. Arney was hired by Altai to misappropriate [CA\u2019s] confidential source code for Altai\u2019s benefit.\u201d At oral argument, CA further contended that:\nThe circumstances of Mr. Arney\u2019s hiring suggested that Mr. Williams wanted more than Mr. Arney\u2019s ability and in fact got exactly what he wanted. And that is Computer Associates\u2019 confidential Adapter technology.\n* * *\n[Arney testified that he] surreptitiously took that code home from Computer Associates after giving notice he was going to go to work for Altai, and after being hired by Mr. Williams to come to Altai and reconstruct Zeke, to work on the MVS operating system.\nIn the aftermath of Judge Mishler\u2019s ruling in its favor on Altai\u2019s motion to dismiss and for summary judgment, CA reasonably believed that it had sufficiently alleged a non-preempted claim. And, in light of CA\u2019s arguments and Judge Mishler\u2019s ruling, Altai clearly was on notice that the amended complaint placed non-preempted trade secret claims in play. See 5 Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1215, at 136-38 (2d ed. 1990) (federal pleading standards require plaintiff to provide defendant with fair notice of claim and grounds it rests on).\nAccordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for reconsideration of those aspects of CA\u2019s trade secret claims related to Altai\u2019s alleged constructive notice of Arney\u2019s theft of CA\u2019s trade secrets and incorporation of those secrets into OSCAR 3.4. We note, however, that CA may be unable to recover damages for its trade secrets which are embodied in OSCAR 3.4 since Altai has conceded copyright liability and damages for its incorporation of ADAPTER into OSCAR 3.4. CA may not obtain a double recovery where the damages for copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation are coextensive.\nHowever, additional trade secret damages may well flow from CA\u2019s creation of OSCAR 3.5. Judge Pratt correctly acknowledged that \u201cif CA\u2019s claim of misappropriation of trade secrets did not fail on preemption grounds, it would be necessary to examine in some detail the conflicting claims and evidence relating to the process by which Altai rewrote OSCAR and ultimately produced version 3.5.\u201d Computer Assocs., 775 F. Supp. at 554-55; see also 1 Milgrim \u00a7 5.04[2][d], at 5-148 (\u201cafter notice, the [innocent] second user should cease the use, and if he does not he can be enjoined and held liable for damages arising from such use subsequent to notice\u201d). Since we hold that CA\u2019s trade secret claims <982 F.2d 721> are not preempted, and that, in writing OSCAR 3.5, Altai had actual notice of Arney\u2019s earlier trade secret violations, we vacate and remand for such further inquiry anticipated by the district court. If the district court finds that CA was injured by Altai\u2019s unlawful use of CA\u2019s trade secrets in creating OSCAR 3.5, CA is entitled to an award of damages for trade secret misappropriation, as well as consideration by the district court of CA\u2019s request for injunctive relief on its trade secret claim.\nConclusion\n\nIn adopting the above three step analysis for substantial similarity between the non-literal elements of computer programs, we seek to insure two things: (1) that programmers may receive appropriate copyright protection for innovative utilitarian works containing expression; and (2) that non-protectable technical expression remains in the public domain for others to use freely as building blocks in their own work. At first blush, it may seem counter-intuitive that someone who has benefited to some degree from illicitly obtained material can emerge from an infringement suit relatively unscathed. However, so long as the appropriated material consists of non-protectable expression, \u201cthis result is neither unfair nor unfortunate. It is the means by which copyright advances the progress of science and art.\u201d Feist, 111 S. Ct. at 1290.\nFurthermore, we underscore that so long as trade secret law is employed in a manner that does not encroach upon the exclusive domain of the Copyright Act, it is an appropriate means by which to secure compensation for software espionage.\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court in part; vacate in part; and remand for further proceedings. The parties shall bear their own costs of appeal, including the petition for rehearing.\nAltimari, Circuit Judge, Concurring in part and Dissenting in part:\n\nBecause I believe that our original opinion, see Computer Assoc. Int\u2019l v. Altai, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 14305, 1992 WL 139364 (2d Cir. 1992), is a reasoned analysis of the issues presented, I adhere to the original determination and therefore concur in Part 1 and respectfully
