SMITH, JR., Circuit Judges, and H. RUSSEL HOLLAND,[*] District Judge.\n\nMILAN D. SMITH, JR., Circuit Judge:\n\nDefendant-Appellant Aram Barsumyan appeals the sentence imposed by the district court following his guilty plea to one count of possession of device-making equipment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(4). Barsumyan contends that his 21-month prison sentence was unreasonable because the operation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10) effected a 6-level increase in his offense level. Barsumyan also argues that the sentencing court impermissibly imposed two conditions of supervised release: a restriction on \"access[ing] or possess[ing] any computer or computer-related devices in any manner,\" and a requirement that, if he is deported and reenters the country, he report to the United States Probation Office. We affirm the sentence and reporting condition, but reverse and vacate the computer restriction and remand to the district court for reconsideration of that condition.\n\nFacts, Procedural History, and Jurisdiction\n\nIn October 2005, an informant cooperating with the United States Secret Service charged that Defendant-Appellant Aram Barsumyan was involved in schemes to manufacture counterfeit credit cards. Barsumyan told this informant that he was interested in making contacts to help him engage in various kinds of credit card fraud. The informant agreed to introduce Barsumyan to a hotel employee, who, unbeknown *1156 to Barsumyan, was an undercover Secret Service Case Agent. During an arranged meeting, the Agent told Barsumyan that, in the course of her duties at the hotel, she had access to guests' credit cards. Barsumyan gave the Agent a \"skimming device,\"[1] and asked her to covertly \"skim\" the hotel guests' credit cards when they registered. The Agent was instructed to then return the device to Barsumyan. He then promised her that for every ten credit card numbers she captured on the device, he would give her two \"high quality\" counterfeit credit cards.\n\nThe following month, the Agent returned the skimming device to Barsumyan, loaded with ten credit card numbers. At a subsequent rendezvous, Barsumyan gave the Agent one counterfeit credit card. When the Agent asked for the promised second card, Barsumyan told her that she was only getting one, because she had only given him six credit card numbers on the skimmer. He also told her that in light of her breach of their understanding, he was altering the deal: thereafter, he would require twenty-five numbers if she wanted an additional card. He then returned the skimming device to the Agent.\n\nBarsumyan was arrested and indicted for one count of producing, using, and trafficking in a counterfeit credit card, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(1), and three counts of possession of device-making equipment, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(4).[2] Pursuant to a plea agreement, Barsumyan pleaded guilty to one count of possession of device-making equipment. The agreement contemplated a base offense level of 6, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(a)(2), with a 2-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(A)(i) for possession of device-making equipment. The government also agreed to recommend a sentence at the low end of the applicable range, as long as the total offense level was 8 or lower.\n\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10), however, not only mandates a 2-level increase in all cases, but also requires that \"[i]f the resulting offense level is less than level 12, increase to level 12.\" Section 2B1.1(b)(10) therefore effectively increased Barsumyan's offense level by six levels. The Presentence Report recommended a 2-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, yielding a total offense level of 10. Barsumyan's probation officer recommended a sentence of 21 months, at the high end of the range prescribed for an offense level of 10, and recommended the following conditions for supervised release:\n\n3. The defendant shall comply with the immigration rules and regulations of the United States, and, if deported from this country, either voluntarily or involuntarily, not reenter the United States illegally. The defendant is not required to report to the Probation Office while residing out-side *1157 of the United States; however, within 72 hours of release from any custody or any reentry to the United States during the period of Courtordered supervision, the defendant shall report for instructions to the United States Probation Office. . . .\n. . .\n5. The defendant shall not access or possess any computer or computer-related devices in any manner, or for any purpose, unless approved in advance by the Probation Officer.\nThe justification provided for the latter condition was simply, \"Condition No. 5 is recommended due to the nature of the offense.\"\n\nOver Barsumyan's objection that the 6-level increase was inappropriate due to the nature of Barsumyan's offense, the district court adopted the recommendations of the probation officer, and imposed a 21-month sentence. The district court further adopted, without analysis, recommended conditions of supervised release No. 3 and No. 5. Barsumyan appealed.\n\nWe have jurisdiction to hear this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\nSentence\n\nBarsumyan first appeals his 21-month sentence.\n\n1. Standard of Review\n\nUnited States v. Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines \"effectively advisory.\" 543 U.S. 220, 245, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005). Following Booker, this court reviews criminal sentences for \"reasonableness,\" in a \"two-step review procedure\" outlined in United States v. Cantrell, 433 F.3d 1269, 1278-81 (9th Cir. 2006).\n\nFirst, we must \"determine whether the district court properly calculated the applicable range under the advisory guidelines.\" United States v. Mohamed, 459 F.3d 979, 985 (9th Cir.2006). In doing so, we review the district court's interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, the determination of the facts for clear error, and the application of the Guidelines to the facts for abuse of discretion. Cantrell, 433 F.3d at 1279. In the event we find error, we remand to the district court so it can recalculate the guideline range in accordance with our direction. Id.\n\nSecond, \"we will next consider challenges to the reasonableness of the overall sentence in light of all the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the applicable Guidelines range.\" Id. at 1280.[3] These factors are to be applied parsimoniously\u2014 the sentence must be \"sufficient, but not *1158 greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\" of punishment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Our review of the district court's sentence is for \"reasonableness,\" which \"merely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\" Rita v. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L. Ed. 2d 203 (2006); see also Gall v. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 128 S. Ct. 586, 591, 169 L. Ed. 2d 445 (2007) (holding that \"courts of appeals must review all sentences\u2014whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range\u2014under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard\").\n\n2. Calculation of the Guidelines Range\n\nBoth parties concede that the district court's determination of sentencing levels within the Guidelines was correct. Although Barsumyan takes issue with the 6-level increase, he does not do so on the ground that the enhancement does not apply here. Rather, he appears to advocate a sort of hybrid reasonableness test, arguing that \"the enhancement\u2014that is, the plain language of the enhancement\u2014is itself unreasonable,\" and therefore ought not to apply.\n\nBarsumyan contends that the severity of the \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10) increase targets \"more aggravated and sophisticated forms of identity theft\" than the simple credit card fraud found in this case. U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 596 (2000) (describing the rationale for the 12-level minimum). He also claims that the 12-level minimum was aimed at two classes of criminals: those who engage in the cloning of wireless telephones[4] and those who engage in \"affirmative\" or \"breeding\" identity theft.[5] To apply \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10) to him, he argues, would create an unreasonably broad and severe enhancement.\n\nBarsumyan's suggested approach to sentencing review clashes with this court's approach, as set forth in Cantrell. That decision envisions two discrete steps in reviewing sentences: first, review of the calculation to verify that \"the district court committed no error in applying the Guidelines,\" followed by \"challenges to the reasonableness of the overall sentence.\" 433 F.3d at 1280; see also Booker, 543 U.S. at 261, 125 S. Ct. 738 (stating that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(3) \"told appellate courts to determine whether the sentence `is unreasonable'\"). Barsumyan, by contrast, seems to urge us to perform a sort of mini-Booker reasonableness determination at each step in determining the Sentencing Guidelines offense level.\n\nBarsumyan's proposition that the district court ought to have reviewed each step for appropriateness under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) is in error. The statutory factors are to be applied \"in determining the particular sentence to be imposed.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Post-Booker, defendants certainly may attack the effect of the Sentencing Guidelines by arguing that they reflect over-broad or mistaken policy priorities. Interestingly, one of the Supreme Court's most recent opinions respecting the Guidelines blessed just such a policy-based deviation from the Sentencing Guidelines. See Kimbrough v. United *1159 States, ___ U.S. ___,  128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (2007) (allowing variance from Guidelines-prescribed sentencing range due to disagreement with crack cocaine/powder cocaine disparity). That deviation however, must come (as it did in Kimbrough) after the advisory Guidelines range has been determined, when the district court examines the final advisory sentencing range dictated by the Guidelines in light of all relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and \"the particular circumstances of [the defendant]'s case.\" Id. at 576, 128 S. Ct. 558; see also id. at 575, 128 S. Ct. 558 (\"The District Court began by properly calculating and considering the advisory Guidelines range. It then addressed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\").[6] If the operation of a particular guideline has inappropriately distorted the final range calculation, that is one factor which the district court may take into account in determining the final sentence.\n\nThe touchstone of a policy-based argument against the Sentencing Guidelines, therefore, is not that a particular upward or downward adjustment, measured in levels, is unreasonable in isolation, but rather that its operation in the case under consideration results in a sentence, measured in months and years, that is inappropriate in light of \u00a7 3553(a). We then review that final, holistic sentencing determination for reasonableness.\n\n3. Reasonableness of the Sentence\n\nIn addition to other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, a district court must consider \"any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5). Similarly, \u00a7 3553(a)(1) requires consideration of \"the nature and circumstances of the offense.\" Both are relevant to Barsumyan's over-criminalization complaint\u2014that he is a petty criminal caught in a net meant to snare far more serious crimes.\n\nThe sentencing court, however, cited a number of \u00a7 3553(a) factors that militate for a harsher punishment. It stated that \"with respect to the nature and circumstances of the offense . . . but for the information from the informant, this could have been a case involving very substantial losses and numerous victims.\" The record reflects that, by stating that he would provide his ersatz co-conspirator with two fake cards for every ten credit card numbers she provided, Barsumyan initially contemplated at a minimum ten victims, and possibly many more.[7] The court also noted the \"calculated\" nature of the offense.\n\nSecond, when it considered the history and characteristics of the defendant, as well as the need to protect the public, the court noted that Barsumyan was not only *1160 \"a recidivist,\" but one whose prior crimes included one conviction for credit card fraud. It also observed that \"His criminal history is escalating, not deescalating, and those all suggest that prison time is appropriate in this case.\"\n\nTherefore, the district court adequately explained the sentence even though it did not specifically comment on Barsumyan's argument regarding the over-broadness of \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(A)(i). Given the defendant's criminal history (including a prior conviction, for which he was then on probation, for a related offense), the calculated and deliberate nature of the crime, and the contemplated number of victims had this crime been successful, we hold that a 21-month sentence was not unreasonable.\n\nConditions of Supervised Release\n\nBarsumyan objects to two conditions of supervised release: the ban on the use of computers (Condition #5) and the requirement that he report to the Parole Office upon reentry after removal (Condition # 3). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d), conditions of supervised release must be \"reasonably related\" to the purposes of punishment set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) and \"involve[ ] no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\" to deter future criminal conduct, protect the public from further crimes, and promote rehabilitation of the defendant.\n\nBecause Barsumyan failed to object to either condition at his sentencing hearing, we review their imposition for plain error under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b). Plain error is (1) error, (2) that is plain and (3) affects \"substantial rights.\" United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-34,  113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1993). \"Moreover, Rule 52(b) leaves the decision to correct the forfeited error within the sound discretion of the court of appeals, and the court should not exercise that discretion unless the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Id. at 732, 113 S. Ct. 1770 (quoting United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15, 105 S. Ct. 1038, 84 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1985)) (quotation marks omitted). If our court holds that imposition of a condition of supervised release is plainly erroneous, we remand to the district court for resentencing on an open record. United States v. Abbouchi, 502 F.3d 850, 858-59 (9th Cir.2007).\n\n1. Computer Restriction\n\nBarsumyan first challenges Condition # 5, the prohibition on \"access[ing] or possess[ing] any computer or computer-related devices in any manner, or for any purpose.\" The record does not indicate what the district court might have meant by \"computer-related devices,\" and given the categorical language involved (\"in any manner\"),[8] one can only speculate as to the outer limits of this proscription\u2014cellular phones? ATMs? Driving a modern car? Checking out groceries using a bar code scanner?\n\nWe confronted a similar condition in United States v. Sales, 476 F.3d 732 (9th Cir.2007).[9] In Sales, the defendant had *1161 been convicted of using his personal computer (including scanner and printer) to make counterfeit $20 bills. Id. at 734. The court rejected the condition forbidding access, however, stating that \"[t]he breadth of condition # 5 is not reasonably related to the nature and circumstances of Sales's counterfeiting offense or Sales's history and characteristics.\" Id. at 736. Rather, the condition \"results in a far greater deprivation of Sales's liberty than is reasonably necessary to prevent recidivism, protect the public, or promote any form of rehabilitation.\" Id.\n\nIf anything, Condition # 5 here is even less appropriate than the condition in Sales. In Sales, the defendant had actually used a computer in the commission of his crime. By contrast, while a computer is required to download the credit card numbers that a skimming device has skimmed, there is no indication that Barsumyan was going to be the one to do the downloading. Barsumyan was \"an intermediary,\" who told the Secret Service Agent that he knew \"two individuals who would be able to produce\" cards from the numbers provided on the skimmer.\n\nThe government's attempts to distinguish Sales are unconvincing. First, it notes that the defendant in Sales had no prior criminal convictions, 476 F.3d at 734, while Barsumyan has several, including another one for credit card forgery.[10] But there is no indication that Barsumyan used a computer in any of those crimes either. Even if he had, however, Sales is clear that a mere nexus between the crime and a computer does not justify proscribing the use of anything containing a circuit board or microchips.[11]\n\nSecond, Barsumyan's statement to the Secret Service Agent that he \"was interested in making money by committing different types of credit card fraud,\" does not justify such a sweeping and indefinite condition. Perhaps Barsumyan's statement refers to different ways of obtaining credit card numbers, or different ways to exploit the numbers. We can only speculate, and that speculation does not make the condition any more \"reasonably necessary\" to prevent further crimes.[12]\n\nHaving determined that it was error to impose Condition # 5, we further hold that the error was plain. Sales struck down a more defined condition on facts that would make a ban on computer access more appropriate than in this case. Cf. Abbouchi, 502 F.3d at 858 (finding plain error where the \"only evidence considered by the district court to support\" a domestic violence treatment program condition \"was a paragraph in the Presentence Report suggesting `strains' in Abbouchi's relationship with his wife and that he and his wife had separated\"). The record in this case shows no attempt, by either the Probation Officer or sentencing court, to justify this *1162 sweeping condition. Had either attempted one, the error would have become apparent.\n\nCondition # 5 affected Barsumyan's \"substantial rights.\" See Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S. Ct. 1770 (holding that error affects substantial rights when it \"affect[s] the outcome of the district court proceeding\"); Abbouchi, 502 F.3d at 858 (holding that imposition of a sentencing condition affects defendant's substantial rights); accord United States v. Dozier, 119 F.3d 239, 244 (3d Cir.1997) (same). Similarly, Abbouchi held that erroneous imposition of a sentencing condition without adequate justification \"seriously affect[ed] the fairness . . . of [the] judicial proceedings.\" 502 F.3d at 858 (quoting United States v. Jordan, 256 F.3d 922, 926 (9th Cir.2001)) (quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe government contends that Barsumyan's \"substantial rights\" were not affected because, as an alien, he \"is likely to be removed/deported from the United States and never subject to supervision.\" It is thus highly unlikely that he will ever be subject to the computer condition that he now challenges.[13] In United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, this court rejected a similar argument made on ripeness grounds, holding that a defendant may \"assert[ ] a facial challenge to a condition imposed upon him at the time of his sentence,\" notwithstanding that several contingencies might have to occur before he could be punished for its violation. 441 F.3d 767, 771-72 (9th Cir.2006). The government's argument here is effectively the converse, i.e., that the challenge is moot because several contingencies must not occur for Barsumyan to be affected. This argument is equally unavailing. The probability that the defendant will actually be subject to the condition is irrelevant to the determination of \"substantial rights\" in the plain error context, which equates \"substantial rights\" with legal prejudice. Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S. Ct. 1770 (\"It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\"). Since the condition would not have been imposed had the error not occurred, it necessarily affected substantial rights.\n\nIn a similar vein, the government contends that Barsumyan's likely removal means we ought to decline to exercise our discretion to consider the plain error under Rule 52(b).[14] Even if removal is \"likely,\" however, it is not certain, and we are unwilling to speculate whether such a sweeping and inappropriate condition will actually be enforced. Neither does the prospect of Barsumyan's future removal mean that the error has not already \"seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\" requiring our correction. Olano, 507 U.S. at 732, 113 S. Ct. 1770.\n\nWe therefore vacate Condition # 5 and remand for the district court to impose a computer-related restriction permitted by this opinion.\n\n2. Reporting Requirement\n\nBarsumyan also complains that Condition # 3, requiring that he report to the Probation Office upon reentry to the United States, violates his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. He contends that to do so would be, in effect, to report himself for the new crime of being found in the country after deportation. *1163 See United States v. Pina-Jaime, 332 F.3d 609, 612 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that an alien need not have reentered the United States illegally to be convicted of being \"found in\" the country illegally). As Barsumyan himself concedes, however, this court has ruled that an identical reporting condition does not violate the Fifth Amendment. See Rodriguez-Rodriguez, 441 F.3d at 772-73. The district court did not err in imposing Condition # 3 in this case.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a 21-month sentence. We further hold that the district court plainly erred in imposing a restriction on all computer use as a condition of supervised release, but did not plainly err in requiring the defendant to report to the Probation Office upon reentry to the United States. The defendant's sentence is AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART and REMANDED.\n\nNOTES\n\n[*] The Honorable H. Russel Holland, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Alaska, sitting by designation.\n\n[1] In this context, \"skimming device\" (or sometimes just \"skimmer\") refers to a small electronic device that can capture the account information encoded on a credit card's magnetic strip. The information is stored on the device until it is downloaded onto a computer, whose operator can then manufacture counterfeit credit cards with magnetic strips identical to those on the genuine cards. Skimming devices can be attached to ordinary credit card readers, capturing a new card's information every time a card is swiped.\n\n[2] \"Device-making equipment\" is defined as \"any equipment, mechanism, or impression designed or primarily used for making an access device or a counterfeit access device.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(6). \"Access device\" means, in relevant part, \"any card, . . . account number, electronic serial number, . . . or other means of account access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain money, goods, services, or any other thing of value, or that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(1).\n\n[3] These factors are:\n\n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;\n\n(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n\n(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;\n\n(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;\n\n(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and\n\n(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;\n\n(3) the kinds of sentences available;\n\n(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for . . . the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set forth in the guidelines . . .\n\n(5) any pertinent policy statement . . . issued by the Sentencing Commission . . . subject to any amendments made to such policy statement by act of Congress. . . .\n\n(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and\n\n(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\n\n[4] Both wireless telephones and credit cards are considered \"access devices\" for these purposes. The cloning of wireless telephones was considered particularly serious because cloned cell phones are commonly used by drug dealers and other criminals to evade surveillance. See 144 Cong. Rec. S3021 (1998) (statement of Sen. Leahy); 143 Cong. Rec. S2655 (1997) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n\n[5] \"Affirmative\" or \"breeding\" identity theft involves \"affirmative activity to generate or `breed' another level of identification means without the knowledge of the individual victim whose identification means are mis-used, purloined, or `taken over.'\" U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 596 (2000). This next level of identification is, in turn, used to create new bank accounts, loans, etc.\n\n[6] In Kimbrough, for example, the district court first cited numerous mitigating factors pertaining to the case itself, such as the defendant's military service, steady history of employment, and lack of prior convictions, as well as the unremarkable nature of the offense. Kimbrough, 128 S.Ct. at 575. Importantly, even as the sentencing court then took into account the irrational effect of the crack/powder disparity, the Supreme Court noted with approval that \"the court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own. Rather, it appropriately framed its final determination in line with \u00a7 3553(a)'s overarching instruction to `impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary' to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in \u00a7 3553(a)(2).\" Id. Instead of rewriting each characteristic, enhancement, and adjustment, the district court in Kimbrough properly calculated the advisory range according to the Guidelines as written, and only deviated from that range after engaging in a holistic \u00a7 3553(a) review.\n\n[7] After allegedly receiving only six numbers, Barsumyan demanded another 25 before he would provide the Agent with another counterfeit credit card. In other words, before his arrest, Barsumyan contemplated at least 31 potential victims.\n\n[8] It is unclear whether \"in any manner\" is meant to refer to manners of devices or manners of accessing or possessing them. Either interpretation would make the condition sweeping in the extreme.\n\n[9] Indeed, the prohibition in Sales was more specific, namely:\n\nComputers and computer-related devices include, but are not limited to, personal computers, personal data assistants (PDAs), internet appliances, electronic games, and cellular telephones, as well as their peripherial equipment, that can access, or be modified to access, the internet, electronic bulletin boards, and other computers, or similar media[.]\n\n476 F.3d at 734. The focus of the prohibition in Sales reflected a concern more with computer connectivity than with computers per se. No such limitation is present here.\n\n[10] The other convictions are for petty theft, vandalism, and speeding.\n\n[11] When this court has upheld conditions restricting Internet access in cases involving child pornography, it has done so citing the \"`strong link between child pornography and the Internet, and the need to protect the public, particularly children, from sex offenders.'\" United States v. Rearden, 349 F.3d 608, 621 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting United States v. Zinn, 321 F.3d 1084, 1093 (11th Cir.2003)). We are aware of no published cases approving Internet restrictions imposed on a defendant convicted of a nonsexual offense \u2014 let alone a restriction on all computer-related devices, whether Internet-capable or not.\n\n[12] Unless \"computer-related devices\" encompasses skimmers (it might not have under the definition in Sales because the skimmers cannot access the Internet), Condition # 5 would not have prevented the crime of which Barsumyan was convicted.\n\n[13] We express no opinion as to Barsumyan's actual removability, and assume, arguendo, (1) that immigration proceedings will rule Barsumyan to be removable and (2) that it is likely that he will actually be deported.\n\n[14] Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) states that \"[a] plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court's attention.\" (Emphasis added).", "annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 57}, {"start": 58, "end": 96}, {"start": 97, "end": 123},

"58b09c410bf16802d61e3a5c": {"text": "Opinion\n\nNOTICE:\u2002This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the United States Reports.\u2003Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n_________________\n\nNo. 10\u20131259\n\n_________________\n\nUNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ANTOINE JONES\n\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit\n\n[January 23, 2012]\nJustice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWe decide whether the attachment of a Global-Positioning-System (GPS) tracking device to an individual\u2019s vehicle, and subsequent use of that device to monitor the vehicle\u2019s movements on public streets, constitutes a search or seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nI\n\nIn 2004 respondent Antoine Jones, owner and operator of a nightclub in the District of Columbia, came under suspicion of trafficking in narcotics and was made the target of an investigation by a joint FBI and Metropolitan Police Department task force. Officers employed various investigative techniques, including visual surveillance of the nightclub, installation of a camera focused on the front door of the club, and a pen register and wiretap covering Jones\u2019s cellular phone.\n\nBased in part on information gathered from these sources, in 2005 the Government applied to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a warrant authorizing the use of an electronic tracking device on the Jeep Grand Cherokee registered to Jones\u2019s wife. A warrant issued, authorizing installation of the de-vice in the District of Columbia and within 10 days.\n\nOn the 11th day, and not in the District of Columbia but in Maryland, 1 agents installed a GPS tracking device on the undercarriage of the Jeep while it was parked in a public parking lot. Over the next 28 days, the Government used the device to track the vehicle\u2019s movements, and once had to replace the device\u2019s battery when the vehicle was parked in a different public lot in Maryland. By means of signals from multiple satellites, the device established the vehicle\u2019s location within 50 to 100 feet, and communicated that location by cellular phone to a Government computer. It relayed more than 2,000 pages of data over the 4-week period.\n\nThe Government ultimately obtained a multiple-count indictment charging Jones and several alleged co-conspirators with, as relevant here, conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7841 and 846. Before trial, Jones filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained through the GPS device. The District Court granted the motion only in part, suppressing the data obtained while the vehicle was parked in the garage adjoining Jones\u2019s residence. 451 F. Supp. 2d 71, 88 (2006). It held the remaining data admissible, because \u201c \u2018[a] person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 281 (1983) ). Jones\u2019s trial in October 2006 produced a hung jury on the conspiracy count.\n\nIn March 2007, a grand jury returned another indictment, charging Jones and others with the same conspir-acy. The Government introduced at trial the same GPS-derived locational data admitted in the first trial, which connected Jones to the alleged conspirators\u2019 stash house that contained $850,000 in cash, 97 kilograms of cocaine, and 1 kilogram of cocaine base. The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the District Court sentenced Jones to life imprisonment.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the conviction because of admission of the evidence obtained by warrantless use ofthe GPS device which, it said, violated the Fourth Amend-ment. United States v. Maynard, 615 F. 3d 544 (2010). The D. C. Circuit denied the Government\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc, with four judges dissenting. 625 F. 3d 766 (2010). We granted certiorari, 564 U. S. ___ (2011).\n\nII\n\nA\n\nThe Fourth Amendment provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d It is beyond dispute that a vehicle is an \u201ceffect\u201d as that term is used in the Amendment. United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 12 (1977) . We hold that the Government\u2019s installation of a GPS device on a target\u2019s vehicle, 2 and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle\u2019s movements, constitutes a \u201csearch.\u201d\n\nIt is important to be clear about what occurred in this case: The Government physically occupied private property for the purpose of obtaining information. We have no doubt that such a physical intrusion would have been considered a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when it was adopted. Entick v. Carrington, 95 Eng. Rep. 807 (C. P. 1765), is a \u201ccase we have described as a \u2018monument of English freedom\u2019 \u2018undoubtedly familiar\u2019 to \u2018every American statesman\u2019 at the time the Constitution was adopted, and considered to be \u2018the true and ultimate expression of constitutional law\u2019 \u201d with regard to search and seizure. Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U. S. 593, 596 (1989) (quoting Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 626 (1886) ). In that case, Lord Camden expressed in plain terms the significance of property rights in search-and-seizure analysis:\n\n\u201c[O]ur law holds the property of every man so sacred, that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour\u2019s close without his leave; if he does he is a trespasser, though he does no damage at all; if he will tread upon his neighbour\u2019s ground, he must justify it by law.\u201d Entick, supra, at 817.\n\nThe text of the Fourth Amendment reflects its close connection to property, since otherwise it would have referred simply to \u201cthe right of the people to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d; the phrase \u201cin their persons, houses, papers, and effects\u201d would have been superfluous.\n\nConsistent with this understanding, our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence was tied to common-law trespass, at least until the latter half of the 20th century. Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 31 (2001) ; Kerr, The Fourth Amendment and New Technologies: Constitutional Myths and the Case for Caution, 102 Mich. L. Rev. 801, 816 (2004). Thus, in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), we held that wiretaps attached to telephone wires on the public streets did not constitute a Fourth Amendment search because \u201c[t]here was no entry of the houses or offices of the defendants,\u201d id., at 464.\n\nOur later cases, of course, have deviated from that exclusively property-based approach. In Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 351 (1967) , we said that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places,\u201d and found a violation in attachment of an eavesdropping device to a public telephone booth. Our later cases have applied the analysis of Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence in that case, which said that a violation occurs when government officers violate a person\u2019s \u201creasonable expectation of privacy,\u201d id., at 360. See, e.g., Bond v. United States, 529 U. S. 334 (2000) ; California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207 (1986) ; Smith v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735 (1979) .\n\nThe Government contends that the Harlan standard shows that no search occurred here, since Jones had no \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d in the area of the Jeep accessed by Government agents (its underbody) and in the locations of the Jeep on the public roads, which were visible to all. But we need not address the Government\u2019s contentions, because Jones\u2019s Fourth Amendment rightsdo not rise or fall with the Katz formulation. At bottom, we must \u201cassur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.\u201d Kyllo, supra, at 34. As explained, for most of our history the Fourth Amendment was understood to embody a particular concern for government trespass upon the areas (\u201cpersons, houses, papers, and effects\u201d) it enumerates. 3 Katz did not repudiate that understanding. Less than two years later the Court upheld defendants\u2019 contention that the Government could not introduce against them conversations between other people obtained by warrantless placement of electronic surveillance devices in their homes. The opinion rejected the dissent\u2019s contention that there was no Fourth Amendment violation \u201cunless the conversational privacy of the homeowner himself is invaded.\u201d 4 Alderman v. United States, 394 U. S. 165, 176 (1969) . \u201c[W]e [do not] believe that Katz, by holding that the Fourth Amendment protects persons and their private conversations, was intendedto withdraw any of the protection which the Amendment extends to the home . . . .\u201d Id., at 180.\n\nMore recently, in Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56 (1992) , the Court unanimously rejected the argument that although a \u201cseizure\u201d had occurred \u201cin a \u2018technical\u2019 sense\u201d when a trailer home was forcibly removed, id., at 62, no Fourth Amendment violation occurred because law enforcement had not \u201cinvade[d] the [individuals\u2019] privacy,\u201d id., at 60. Katz, the Court explained, established that \u201cproperty rights are not the sole measure of Fourth Amendment violations,\u201d but did not \u201csnuf[f] out the previously recognized protection for property.\u201d 506 U. S., at 64. As Justice Brennan explained in his concurrence in Knotts, Katz did not erode the principle \u201cthat, when the Government does engage in physical intrusion of a constitutionally protected area in order to obtain information, that intrusion may constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d 460 U. S., at 286 (opinion concurring in judgment). We have embodied that preservation of past rights in our very definition of \u201creasonable expectationof privacy\u201d which we have said to be an expectation \u201cthat has a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law orto understandings that are recognized and permitted by society.\u201d Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 88 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Katz did not narrow the Fourth Amendment\u2019s scope. 5\n\nThe Government contends that several of our post-Katz cases foreclose the conclusion that what occurred here constituted a search. It relies principally on two cases in which we rejected Fourth Amendment challenges to \u201cbeepers,\u201d electronic tracking devices that represent another form of electronic monitoring. The first case, Knotts, upheld against Fourth Amendment challenge the use of a \u201cbeeper\u201d that had been placed in a container of chloroform, allowing law enforcement to monitor the location of the container. 460 U. S., at 278. We said that there had been no infringement of Knotts\u2019 reasonable expectation of privacy since the information obtained\u2014the location of the automobile carrying the container on public roads, andthe location of the off-loaded container in open fields near Knotts\u2019 cabin\u2014had been voluntarily conveyed to the public. 6 Id., at 281\u2013282. But as we have discussed, the Katz reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test has been added to, not substituted for, the common-law trespassory test. The holding in Knotts addressed only the former, since the latter was not at issue. The beeper had been placed inthe container before it came into Knotts\u2019 possession, with the consent of the then-owner. 460 U. S., at 278. Knotts did not challenge that installation, and we specifically de-clined to consider its effect on the Fourth Amendment analysis. Id., at 279, n. Knotts would be relevant, perhaps, if the Government were making the argument that what would otherwise be an unconstitutional search isnot such where it produces only public information. The Government does not make that argument, and we know of no case that would support it.\n\nThe second \u201cbeeper\u201d case, United States v. Karo, 468 U. S. 705 (1984) , does not suggest a different conclusion. There we addressed the question left open by Knotts, whether the installation of a beeper in a container amounted to a search or seizure. 468 U. S., at 713. As in Knotts, at the time the beeper was installed the container belonged to a third party, and it did not come into possession of the defendant until later. 468 U. S., at 708. Thus, the specific question we considered was whether the installation \u201cwith the consent of the original owner constitute[d] a search or seizure . . . when the container is delivered to a buyer having no knowledge of the presence of the beeper.\u201d Id., at 707 (emphasis added). We held not. The Government, we said, came into physical contact withthe container only before it belonged to the defendant Karo; and the transfer of the container with the unmonitored beeper inside did not convey any information and thus did not invade Karo\u2019s privacy. See id., at 712. That conclusion is perfectly consistent with the one we reach here. Karo accepted the container as it came to him, beeper and all, and was therefore not entitled to object to the beeper\u2019s presence, even though it was used to monitor the container\u2019s location. Cf. On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747\u2013752 (1952) (no search or seizure where an informant, who was wearing a concealed microphone, was invited into the defendant\u2019s business). Jones, who possessed the Jeep at the time the Government trespassorily inserted the information-gathering device, is on much different footing.\n\nThe Government also points to our exposition in New York v. Class, 475 U. S. 106 (1986), that \u201c[t]he exterior ofa car . . . is thrust into the public eye, and thus to examine it does not constitute a \u2018search.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 114. That statement is of marginal relevance here since, as the Government acknowledges, \u201cthe officers in this case did more than conduct a visual inspection of respondent\u2019s vehicle,\u201d Brief for United States 41 (emphasis added). By attaching the device to the Jeep, officers encroached on a protected area. In Class itself we suggested that this would make a difference, for we concluded that an officer\u2019s momentary reaching into the interior of a vehicle did constitute a search. 7 475 U. S., at 114\u2013115.\n\nFinally, the Government\u2019s position gains little support from our conclusion in Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170 (1984) , that officers\u2019 information-gathering intrusion on an \u201copen field\u201d did not constitute a Fourth Amendment search even though it was a trespass at common law, id., at 183. Quite simply, an open field, unlike the curtilage of a home, see United States v. Dunn, 480 U. S. 294, 300 (1987) , is not one of those protected areas enumerated in the Fourth Amendment. Oliver, supra, at 176\u2013177. See also Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57, 59 (1924) . The Government\u2019s physical intrusion on such an area\u2014unlike its intrusion on the \u201ceffect\u201d at issue here\u2014is of no Fourth Amendment significance. 8\n\nB\n\nThe concurrence begins by accusing us of applying \u201c18th-century tort law.\u201d Post, at 1. That is a distortion. What we apply is an 18th-century guarantee against un-reasonable searches, which we believe must provide at a minimum the degree of protection it afforded when it was adopted. The concurrence does not share that belief. It would apply exclusively Katz\u2019s reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test, even when that eliminates rights that previously existed.\n\nThe concurrence faults our approach for \u201cpresent[ing] particularly vexing problems\u201d in cases that do not involve physical contact, such as those that involve the transmission of electronic signals. Post, at 9. We entirely fail to understand that point. For unlike the concurrence, which would make Katz the exclusive test, we do not make trespass the exclusive test. Situations involving merely the transmission of electronic signals without trespass would remain subject to Katz analysis.\n\nIn fact, it is the concurrence\u2019s insistence on the exclusivity of the Katz test that needlessly leads us into \u201cparticularly vexing problems\u201d in the present case. This Court has to date not deviated from the understanding that mere visual observation does not constitute a search. See Kyllo, 533 U. S., at 31\u201332. We accordingly held in Knotts that \u201c[a] person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.\u201d 460 U. S., at 281. Thus, even assuming that the concurrence is correct tosay that \u201c[t]raditional surveillance\u201d of Jones for a 4-week period \u201cwould have required a large team of agents, multiple vehicles, and perhaps aerial assistance,\u201d post, at 12, our cases suggest that such visual observation is constitutionally permissible. It may be that achieving the same result through electronic means, without an accompany-ing trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, but the present case does not require us to answer that question.\n\nAnd answering it affirmatively leads us needlessly into additional thorny problems. The concurrence posits that \u201crelatively short-term monitoring of a person\u2019s movements on public streets\u201d is okay, but that \u201cthe use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses\u201d is no good. Post, at 13 (emphasis added). That introduces yet another novelty into our jurisprudence. There is no precedent for the proposition that whether a search has occurred depends on the nature of the crime being investigated. And even accepting that novelty, it remains unexplained why a 4-week investigation is \u201csurely\u201d too long and why a drug-trafficking conspiracy involving sub-stantial amounts of cash and narcotics is not an \u201cextra-ordinary offens[e]\u201d which may permit longer observation. See post, at 13\u201314. What of a 2-day monitoring of asuspected purveyor of stolen electronics? Or of a 6-month monitoring of a suspected terrorist? We may have to grapple with these \u201cvexing problems\u201d in some future case where a classic trespassory search is not involved and resort must be had to Katz analysis; but there is no reason for rushing forward to resolve them here.\n\nIII\n\nThe Government argues in the alternative that even if the attachment and use of the device was a search, it was reasonable\u2014and thus lawful\u2014under the Fourth Amendment because \u201cofficers had reasonable suspicion, and in-deed probable cause, to believe that [Jones] was a leader in a large-scale cocaine distribution conspiracy.\u201d Brief for United States 50\u201351. We have no occasion to consider this argument. The Government did not raise it below, and the D. C. Circuit therefore did not address it. See 625 F. 3d, at 767 (Ginsburg, Tatel, and Griffith, JJ., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc). We consider the argument forfeited. See Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, n. 4 (2002).\n\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit is affirmed.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\nNotes\n1 In this litigation, the Government has conceded noncompliance with the warrant and has argued only that a warrant was not required. United States v. Maynard, 615 F. 3d 544, 566, n. (CADC 2010).\n\n2 As we have noted, the Jeep was registered to Jones\u2019s wife. The Government acknowledged, however, that Jones was \u201cthe exclusive driver.\u201d Id., at 555, n. (internal quotation marks omitted). If Jones was not the owner he had at least the property rights of a bailee. The Court of Appeals concluded that the vehicle\u2019s registration did not affect his ability to make a Fourth Amendment objection, ibid., and the Government has not challenged that determination here. We therefore do not consider the Fourth Amendment significance of Jones\u2019s status.\n\n3 Justice Alito\u2019s concurrence (hereinafter concurrence) doubts the wisdom of our approach because \u201cit is almost impossible to think of late-18th-century situations that are analogous to what took place in this case.\u201d Post, at 3 (opinion concurring in judgment). But in fact it posits a situation that is not far afield\u2014a constable\u2019s concealing himself in the target\u2019s coach in order to track its movements. Ibid. There is no doubt that the information gained by that trespassory activity would be the product of an unlawful search\u2014whether that information consisted of the conversations occurring in the coach, or of the destinations to which the coach traveled. In any case, it is quite irrelevant whether there was an 18th-century analog. Whatever new methods of investigation may be devised, our task, at a minimum, is to decide whether the action in question would have constituted a \u201csearch\u201d within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Where, as here, the Government obtains information by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area, such a search has undoubtedly occurred.\n\n4 Thus, the concurrence\u2019s attempt to recast Alderman as meaning that individuals have a \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy in all conversations that [take] place under their roof,\u201d post, at 6\u20137, is foreclosed by the Court\u2019s opinion. The Court took as a given that the homeowner\u2019s \u201cconversational privacy\u201d had not been violated.\n\n5 The concurrence notes that post-Katz we have explained that \u201c \u2018an actual trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish a constitutional violation.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 6 (quoting United States v. Karo, 468 U. S. 705, 713 (1984) ). That is undoubtedly true, and undoubtedly irrelevant. Karo was considering whether a seizure occurred, and as the concurrence explains, a seizure of property occurs, not when there is a trespass, but \u201cwhen there is some meaningful interference with an individual\u2019s possessory interests in that property.\u201d Post, at 2 (internal quotation marks omitted). Likewise with a search. Trespass alone does not qualify, but there must be conjoined with that what was present here: an attempt to find something or to obtain information. Related to this, and similarly irrelevant, is the concurrence\u2019s point that, if analyzed separately, neither the installation of the device nor its use would constitute a Fourth Amendment search. See ibid. Of course not. A trespass on \u201chouses\u201d or \u201ceffects,\u201d or a Katz invasion of privacy, is not alone a search unless it is done to obtain information; and the obtaining of information is not alone a search unless it is achieved by such a trespass or invasion of privacy.\n\n6 Knotts noted the \u201climited use which the government made of the signals from this particular beeper,\u201d 460 U. S., at 284; and reserved the question whether \u201cdifferent constitutional principles may be applicable\u201d to \u201cdragnet-type law enforcement practices\u201d of the type that GPS tracking made possible here, ibid.\n\n7 The Government also points to Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U. S. 583 (1974) , in which the Court rejected the claim that the inspection of an impounded vehicle\u2019s tire tread and the collection of paint scrapings from its exterior violated the Fourth Amendment. Whether the plural-ity said so because no search occurred or because the search was rea-sonable is unclear. Compare id., at 591 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (\u201c[W]e fail to comprehend what expectation of privacy was infringed\u201d), with id., at 592 (\u201cUnder circumstances such as these, where probable cause exists, a warrantless examination of the exterior of a car is not unreasonable . . . \u201d).\n\n8 Thus, our theory is not that the Fourth Amendment is concerned with \u201cany technical trespass that led to the gathering of evidence.\u201d Post, at 3 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis added). The Fourth Amendment protects against trespassory searches only with regard to those items (\u201cpersons, houses, papers, and effects\u201d) that it enumerates. The trespass that occurred in Oliver may properly be understood as a \u201csearch,\u201d but not one \u201cin the constitutional sense.\u201d 466 U. S., at 170, 183.\nTOP\nConcurrence\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n_________________\n\nNo. 10\u20131259\n\n_________________\n\nUNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ANTOINE JONES\n\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit\n\n[January 23, 2012]\nJustice Sotomayor, concurring.\n\nI join the Court\u2019s opinion because I agree that a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment occurs, at a minimum, \u201c[w]here, as here, the Government obtains information by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area.\u201d Ante, at 6, n. 3. In this case, the Government installed a Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking device on respondent Antoine Jones\u2019 Jeep without a valid warrant and without Jones\u2019 consent, then used that device to monitor the Jeep\u2019s movements over the course of four weeks. The Government usurped Jones\u2019 property for the purpose of conducting surveillance on him, thereby invading privacy interests long afforded, and undoubtedly entitled to, Fourth Amendment protection. See, e.g., Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505\u2013512 (1961).\n\nOf course, the Fourth Amendment is not concerned only with trespassory intrusions on property. See, e.g., Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27\u201333 (2001). Rather, even in the absence of a trespass, \u201ca Fourth Amendment search occurs when the government violates a subjective expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable.\u201d Id., at 33; see also Smith v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735\u2013741 (1979); Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 361 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring). In Katz, this Court enlarged its then-prevailing focus on property rights by announcing that the reach of the Fourth Amendment does not \u201cturn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion.\u201d Id., at 353. As the majority\u2019s opinion makes clear, however, Katz\u2019s reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test augmented, but did not displace or diminish, the common-law trespassory test that preceded it. Ante, at 8. Thus, \u201cwhen the Government does engage in physical intrusion of a constitutionally protected area in order to obtain information, that intrusion may constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 286 (1983) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment); see also, e.g., Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128, n. 12 (1978). Justice Alito\u2019s approach, which discounts altogether the constitutional relevance of the Government\u2019s physical intrusion on Jones\u2019 Jeep, erodes that longstanding protection for privacy expectations inherent in items of property that people possess or control. See post, at 5\u20137 (opinion concurring in judgment). By contrast, the trespassory test applied in the majority\u2019s opinion reflects an irreducible constitutional minimum: When the Government physically invades personal property to gather information, a search occurs. The reaffirmation of that principle suffices to decide this case.\n\nNonetheless, as Justice Alito notes, physical intrusion is now unnecessary to many forms of surveillance. Post, at 9\u201312. With increasing regularity, the Government will be capable of duplicating the monitoring undertaken in this case by enlisting factory- or owner-installed vehicle tracking devices or GPS-enabled smartphones. See United States v. Pineda-Moreno, 617 F. 3d 1120, 1125 (CA9 2010) (Kozinski, C. J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). In cases of electronic or other novel modes of surveillance that do not depend upon a physical invasionon property, the majority opinion\u2019s trespassory test may provide little guidance. But \u201c[s]ituations involving merely the transmission of electronic signals without trespass would remain subject to Katz analysis.\u201d Ante, at 11. As Justice Alito incisively observes, the same technological advances that have made possible nontrespassory surveillance techniques will also affect the Katz test by shaping the evolution of societal privacy expectations. Post, at10\u201311. Under that rubric, I agree with Justice Alito that, at the very least, \u201clonger term GPS monitoring in inves-tigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy.\u201d Post, at 13.\n\nIn cases involving even short-term monitoring, some unique attributes of GPS surveillance relevant to the Katz analysis will require particular attention. GPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person\u2019s public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations. See, e.g., People v. Weaver, 12 N. Y. 3d 433, 441\u2013442, 909 N. E. 2d 1195, 1199 (2009) (\u201cDisclosed in [GPS] data . . . will be trips the indisputably private nature of which takes little imagination to conjure: tripsto the psychiatrist, the plastic surgeon, the abortion clinic, the AIDS treatment center, the strip club, the criminal defense attorney, the by-the-hour motel, the union meeting, the mosque, synagogue or church, the gay bar andon and on\u201d). The Government can store such recordsand efficiently mine them for information years into the future. Pineda-Moreno, 617 F. 3d, at 1124 (opinion of Kozinski, C. J.). And because GPS monitoring is cheapin comparison to conventional surveillance techniques and,by design, proceeds surreptitiously, it evades the ordinary checks that constrain abusive law enforcement practices: \u201climited police resources and community hostility.\u201d Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U. S. 419, 426 (2004) .\n\nAwareness that the Government may be watching chills associational and expressive freedoms. And the Government\u2019s unrestrained power to assemble data that reveal private aspects of identity is susceptible to abuse. The net result is that GPS monitoring\u2014by making available at a relatively low cost such a substantial quantum of intimate information about any person whom the Government, in its unfettered discretion, chooses to track\u2014may \u201calter the relationship between citizen and government in a way that is inimical to democratic society.\u201d United States v. Cuevas-Perez, 640 F. 3d 272, 285 (CA7 2011) (Flaum, J., concurring).\n\nI would take these attributes of GPS monitoring into account when considering the existence of a reasonable societal expectation of privacy in the sum of one\u2019s public movements. I would ask whether people reasonably expect that their movements will be recorded and aggregated in a manner that enables the Government to ascertain, more or less at will, their political and religious beliefs, sexual habits, and so on. I do not regard as dispositivethe fact that the Government might obtain the fruits of GPS monitoring through lawful conventional surveillance techniques. See Kyllo, 533 U. S., at 35, n. 2; ante, at 11 (leaving open the possibility that duplicating traditional surveillance \u201cthrough electronic means, without an accompanying trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy\u201d). I would also consider the appropriateness of entrusting to the Executive, in the absence of any oversight from a coordinate branch, a tool so amenable to misuse, especially in light of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s goal to curb arbitrary exercises of police power to and prevent \u201ca too permeating police surveillance,\u201d United States v.Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 595 (1948) . 1 *\n\nMore fundamentally, it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. E.g., Smith, 442 U. S., at 742; United States v. Miller, 425 U. S. 435, 443 (1976) . This approach is ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks. People disclose the phone numbers that they dial or text to their cellu-lar providers; the URLs that they visit and the e-mail addresses with which they correspond to their Internet service providers; and the books, groceries, and medi-cations they purchase to online retailers. Perhaps, as Justice Alito notes, some people may find the \u201ctradeoff \u201d of privacy for convenience \u201cworthwhile,\u201d or come to accept this \u201cdiminution of privacy\u201d as \u201cinevitable,\u201d post, at 10, and perhaps not. I for one doubt that people would accept without complaint the warrantless disclosure to the Government of a list of every Web site they had visited in the last week, or month, or year. But whatever the societal expectations, they can attain constitutionally protected status only if our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence ceases to treat secrecy as a prerequisite for privacy. I would not assume that all information voluntarily disclosed to some member of the public for a limited purpose is, for that reason alone, disentitled to Fourth Amendment protection. See Smith, 442 U. S., at 749 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\u201cPrivacy is not a discrete commodity, possessed absolutely or not at all. Those who disclose certain facts to a bank or phone company for a limited business purpose need not assume that this information will be released to other persons for other purposes\u201d); see also Katz, 389 U. S., at 351\u2013352 (\u201c[W]hat [a person] seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected\u201d).\n\nResolution of these difficult questions in this case is unnecessary, however, because the Government\u2019s physical intrusion on Jones\u2019 Jeep supplies a narrower basis for decision. I therefore join the majority\u2019s opinion.\n\nNotes\n1* United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276 (1983) , does not foreclose the conclusion that GPS monitoring, in the absence of a physical intrusion, is a Fourth Amendment search. As the majority\u2019s opinion notes, Knotts reserved the question whether \u201c \u2018different constitutional principlesmay be applicable\u2019 \u201d to invasive law enforcement practices such as GPS tracking. See ante, at 8, n. 6 (quoting 460 U. S., at 284).United States v. Karo, 468 U. S. 705 (1984) , addressed the Fourth Amendment implications of the installation of a beeper in a container with the consent of the container\u2019s original owner, who was awarethat the beeper would be used for surveillance purposes. Id., at 707. Owners of GPS-equipped cars and smartphones do not contemplate that these devices will be used to enable covert surveillance of their movements. To the contrary, subscribers of one such service greeteda similar suggestion with anger. Quain, Changes to OnStar\u2019s Privacy Terms Rile Some Users, N. Y. Times (Sept. 22, 2011), online at http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/changes-to-onstars-privacy-terms-rile-some-users (as visited Jan. 19, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). In addition, the bugged container in Karo lacked the close relationship with the target that a car shares with its owner. The bugged container in Karo was stationary for much of the Government\u2019s surveillance. See 468 U. S., at 708\u2013710. A car\u2019s movements, by contrast, are its owner\u2019s movements.\n\nTOP\nConcurrence\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n_________________\n\nNo. 10\u20131259\n\n_________________\n\nUNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ANTOINE JONES\n\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit\n\n[January 23, 2012]\nJustice Alito, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Kagan join, concurring in the judgment.\n\nThis case requires us to apply the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures to a 21st-century surveillance technique, the use of a Global Po-sitioning System (GPS) device to monitor a vehicle\u2019s move-ments for an extended period of time. Ironically, the Court has chosen to decide this case based on 18th-century tort law. By attaching a small GPS device 1 to the underside of the vehicle that respondent drove, the law enforcement officers in this case engaged in conduct that might have provided grounds in 1791 for a suit for trespass to chattels. 2 And for this reason, the Court concludes, the installation and use of the GPS device constituted a search. Ante, at 3\u20134.\n\nThis holding, in my judgment, is unwise. It strains the language of the Fourth Amendment; it has little if any support in current Fourth Amendment case law; and it is highly artificial.\n\nI would analyze the question presented in this case by asking whether respondent\u2019s reasonable expectations of privacy were violated by the long-term monitoring of the movements of the vehicle he drove.\n\nI\n\nA\n\nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d and the Court makes very little effort to explain how the attachment or use of the GPS device fits within these terms. The Court does not contend that there was a seizure. A seizure of property occurs when there is \u201csome meaningful interference with an in-dividual\u2019s possessory interests in that property,\u201d United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U. S. 109, 113 (1984) , and here there was none. Indeed, the success of the surveillance technique that the officers employed was dependent on the fact that the GPS did not interfere in any way with the operation of the vehicle, for if any such interference had been detected, the device might have been discovered.\n\nThe Court does claim that the installation and use of the GPS constituted a search, see ante, at 3\u20134, but this con-clusion is dependent on the questionable proposition that these two procedures cannot be separated for purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis. If these two procedures are analyzed separately, it is not at all clear from the Court\u2019s opinion why either should be regarded as a search. It is clear that the attachment of the GPS device was not itself a search; if the device had not functioned or if the officers had not used it, no information would have been obtained. And the Court does not contend that the use of the device constituted a search either. On the contrary, the Court accepts the holding in United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276 (1983) , that the use of a surreptitiously planted electronic device to monitor a vehicle\u2019s movements on public roads did not amount to a search. See ante, at 7.\n\nThe Court argues\u2014and I agree\u2014that \u201cwe must \u2018assur[e] preservation of that degree of privacy against government that existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 5 (quoting Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27, 34 (2001)). But it is almost impossible to think of late- 18th-century situations that are analogous to what took place in this case. (Is it possible to imagine a case in which a constable secreted himself somewhere in a coach and remained there for a period of time in order to monitor the movements of the coach\u2019s owner? 3 ) The Court\u2019s theory seems to be that the concept of a search, as originally un-derstood, comprehended any technical trespass that led to the gathering of evidence, but we know that this is in-correct. At common law, any unauthorized intrusion on private property was actionable, see Prosser & Keeton 75, but a trespass on open fields, as opposed to the \u201ccurtilage\u201d of a home, does not fall within the scope of the Fourth Amendment because private property outside the curtilage is not part of a \u201chous[e]\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. See Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170 (1984) ; Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57 (1924) .\n\nB\n\nThe Court\u2019s reasoning in this case is very similar to that in the Court\u2019s early decisions involving wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping, namely, that a technical trespass followed by the gathering of evidence constitutes a search. In the early electronic surveillance cases, the Court concluded that a Fourth Amendment search occurred when private conversations were monitored as a result of an \u201cunauthorized physical penetration into the premises occupied\u201d by the defendant. Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 509 (1961) . In Silverman, police officers listened to conversations in an attached home by inserting a \u201cspike mike\u201d through the wall that this house shared with the vacant house next door. Id., at 506. This procedure was held to be a search because the mike made contact with a heating duct on the other side of the wall and thus \u201cusurp[ed] . . . an integral part of the premises.\u201d Id., at 511.\n\nBy contrast, in cases in which there was no trespass, it was held that there was no search. Thus, in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928) , the Court found that the Fourth Amendment did not apply because \u201c[t]he taps from house lines were made in the streets near the houses.\u201d Id., at 457. Similarly, the Court concluded that no search occurred in Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129, 135 (1942) , where a \u201cdetectaphone\u201d was placed on the outer wall of defendant\u2019s office for the purpose of overhearing conversations held within the room.\n\nThis trespass-based rule was repeatedly criticized. In Olmstead, Justice Brandeis wrote that it was \u201cimmaterial where the physical connection with the telephone wires was made.\u201d 277 U. S., at 479 (dissenting opinion). Al-though a private conversation transmitted by wire did not fall within the literal words of the Fourth Amendment, he argued, the Amendment should be understood as prohibiting \u201cevery unjustifiable intrusion by the government upon the privacy of the individual.\u201d Id., at 478. See also, e.g., Silverman, supra, at 513 (Douglas, J., concurring) (\u201cThe concept of \u2018an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises,\u2019 on which the present decision rests seems to me beside the point. Was not the wrong . . . done when the intimacies of the home were tapped, recorded, or revealed? The depth of the penetration of the electronic device\u2014even the degree of its remoteness from the inside of the house\u2014is not the measure of the injury\u201d); Goldman, supra, at 139 (Murphy, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he search of one\u2019s home or office no longer requires physical entry, for science has brought forth far more effective devices for the invasion of a person\u2019s privacy than the direct and obvious methods of oppression which were detested by our forebears and which inspired the Fourth Amendment\u201d).\n\nKatz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967) , finally did away with the old approach, holding that a trespass was not required for a Fourth Amendment violation. Katz in-volved the use of a listening device that was attached to the outside of a public telephone booth and that allowed police officers to eavesdrop on one end of the target\u2019s phone conversation. This procedure did not physically intrude on the area occupied by the target, but the Katz Court, \u201crepudiate[ed]\u201d the old doctrine, Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128, 143 (1978) , and held that \u201c[t]he fact that the electronic device employed . . . did not happen to penetrate the wall of the booth can have no constitutional significance,\u201d 389 U. S., at 353 (\u201c[T]he reach of th[e] [Fourth] Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure\u201d); see Rakas, supra, at 143 (describing Katz as holding that the \u201cca-pacity to claim the protection for the Fourth Amendment depends not upon a property right in the invaded place but upon whether the person who claims the protection of the Amendment has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place\u201d); Kyllo, supra, at 32 (\u201cWe have since decoupled violation of a person\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights from trespassory violation of his property\u201d). What mattered, the Court now held, was whether the conduct at issue \u201cviolated the privacy upon which [the defendant] justifiably relied while using the telephone booth.\u201d Katz, supra, at 353.\n\nUnder this approach, as the Court later put it when addressing the relevance of a technical trespass, \u201can actual trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish a constitutional violation.\u201d United States v. Karo, 468 U. S. 705, 713 (1984) (emphasis added). Ibid. (\u201cCompar[ing] Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967) (no trespass, but Fourth Amendment violation), with Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170 (1984) (trespass, but no Fourth Amendment violation)\u201d). In Oliver, the Court wrote:\n\n\u201cThe existence of a property right is but one element in determining whether expectations of privacy are legitimate. \u2018The premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited.\u2019 Katz, 389 U. S., at 353, (quoting Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 304 (1967) ; some internal quotation marks omitted).\u201d 466 U. S., at 183.\n\nII\n\nThe majority suggests that two post-Katz decisions\u2014Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S. 56 (1992) , and Alderman v. United States, 394 U. S. 165 (1969) \u2014show that a technical trespass is sufficient to establish the existence of a search, but they provide little support.\n\nIn Soldal, the Court held that towing away a trailer home without the owner\u2019s consent constituted a seizure even if this did not invade the occupants\u2019 personal privacy. But in the present case, the Court does not find that there was a seizure, and it is clear that none occurred.\n\nIn Alderman, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment rights of homeowners were implicated by the use of a surreptitiously planted listening device to monitor third-party conversations that occurred within their home. See 394 U. S., at 176\u2013180. Alderman is best understood to mean that the homeowners had a legitimate expectation of privacy in all conversations that took place under their roof. See Rakas, 439 U. S., at 144, n. 12 (citing Alderman for the proposition that \u201cthe Court has not altogether abandoned use of property concepts in determining the presence or absence of the privacy interests protected by that Amendment\u201d); 439 U. S., at 153 (Powell, J., concurring) (citing Alderman for the proposition that \u201cproperty rights reflect society\u2019s explicit recognition of a person\u2019s au-thority to act as he wishes in certain areas, and there-fore should be considered in determining whether an individual\u2019s expectations of privacy are reasonable); Karo, supra, at 732 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing Alderman in support of the proposition that \u201ca homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his home, including items owned by others\u201d).\n\nIn sum, the majority is hard pressed to find support in post-Katz cases for its trespass-based theory.\n\nIII\n\nDisharmony with a substantial body of existing case law is only one of the problems with the Court\u2019s approach in this case.\n\nI will briefly note four others. First, the Court\u2019s reasoning largely disregards what is really important (the use of a GPS for the purpose of long-term tracking) and instead attaches great significance to something that most would view as relatively minor (attaching to the bottom of a car a small, light object that does not interfere in any way with the car\u2019s operation). Attaching such an object is generally regarded as so trivial that it does not provide a basis for recovery under modern tort law. See Prosser & Keeton \u00a714, at 87 (harmless or trivial contact with personal property not actionable); D. Dobbs, Law of Torts 124 (2000) (same). But under the Court\u2019s reasoning, this conduct may violate the Fourth Amendment. By contrast, if long-term monitoring can be accomplished without committing a technical trespass\u2014suppose, for example, that the Federal Government required or persuaded auto manufacturers to include a GPS tracking device in every car\u2014the Court\u2019s theory would provide no protection.\n\nSecond, the Court\u2019s approach leads to incongruous results. If the police attach a GPS device to a car and use the device to follow the car for even a brief time, under the Court\u2019s theory, the Fourth Amendment applies. But if the police follow the same car for a much longer period using unmarked cars and aerial assistance, this tracking is not subject to any Fourth Amendment constraints.\n\nIn the present case, the Fourth Amendment applies, the Court concludes, because the officers installed the GPS device after respondent\u2019s wife, to whom the car was registered, turned it over to respondent for his exclusive use. See ante, at 8. But if the GPS had been attached prior to that time, the Court\u2019s theory would lead to a different result. The Court proceeds on the assumption that respondent \u201chad at least the property rights of a bailee,\u201d ante, at 3, n. 2, but a bailee may sue for a trespass to chattel only if the injury occurs during the term of the bailment. See 8A Am. Jur. 2d, Bailment \u00a7166, pp. 685\u2013686 (2009). So if the GPS device had been installed before respondent\u2019s wife gave him the keys, respondent would have no claim for trespass\u2014and, presumably, no Fourth Amendment claim either.\n\nThird, under the Court\u2019s theory, the coverage of the Fourth Amendment may vary from State to State. If the events at issue here had occurred in a community property State 4 or a State that has adopted the Uniform Marital Property Act, 5 respondent would likely be an owner of the vehicle, and it would not matter whether the GPS was installed before or after his wife turned over the keys. In non-community-property States, on the other hand, the registration of the vehicle in the name of respondent\u2019s wife would generally be regarded as presumptive evidence that she was the sole owner. See 60 C. J. S., Motor Vehicles \u00a7231, pp. 398\u2013399 (2002); 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Automobiles \u00a71208, pp. 859\u2013860 (2007).\n\nFourth, the Court\u2019s reliance on the law of trespass will present particularly vexing problems in cases involving surveillance that is carried out by making electronic, as opposed to physical, contact with the item to be tracked. For example, suppose that the officers in the present case had followed respondent by surreptitiously activating a stolen vehicle detection system that came with the car when it was purchased. Would the sending of a radio signal to activate this system constitute a trespass to chattels? Trespass to chattels has traditionally required a physical touching of the property. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7217 and Comment e (1963 and 1964); Dobbs, supra, at 123. In recent years, courts have wrestled with the application of this old tort in cases involving unwanted electronic contact with computer systems, and some have held that even the transmission of electrons that occurs when a communication is sent from one computer to another is enough. See, e.g., CompuServe, Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc. 962 F. Supp. 1015, 1021 (SD Ohio 1997); Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v. Bezenek, 46 Cal. App. 4th 1559, 1566, n. 6 (1996). But may such decisions be followed in applying the Court\u2019s trespass theory? Assuming that what matters under the Court\u2019s theory is the law of trespass as it existed at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, do these recent decisions represent a change in the law or simply the application of the old tort to new situations?\n\nIV\n\nA\n\nThe Katz expectation-of-privacy test avoids the problems and complications noted above, but it is not without its own difficulties. It involves a degree of circularity, see Kyllo, 533 U. S., at 34, and judges are apt to confuse their own expectations of privacy with those of the hypothetical reasonable person to which the Katz test looks. See Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U. S. 83, 97 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring). In addition, the Katz test rests on the assumption that this hypothetical reasonable person has a well-developed and stable set of privacy expectations. But technology can change those expectations. Dramatic technological change may lead to periods in which popular expectations are in flux and may ultimately produce significant changes in popular attitudes. New technology may provide increased convenience or security at the expense of privacy, and many people may find the tradeoff worthwhile. And even if the public does not welcome the diminution of privacy that new technology entails, they may eventually reconcile themselves to this development as inevitable. 6\n\nOn the other hand, concern about new intrusions on privacy may spur the enactment of legislation to protect against these intrusions. This is what ultimately happened with respect to wiretapping. After Katz, Congress did not leave it to the courts to develop a body of Fourth Amendment case law governing that complex subject. Instead, Congress promptly enacted a comprehensive statute, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72510\u20132522 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV), and since that time, the regulation of wiretapping has been governed primarily by statute and not by case law. 7 In an ironic sense, although Katz overruled Olmstead, Chief Justice Taft\u2019s suggestion in the latter case that the regulation of wiretapping was a matter better left for Congress, see 277 U. S., at 465\u2013466, has been borne out.\n\nB\n\nRecent years have seen the emergence of many new devices that permit the monitoring of a person\u2019s movements. In some locales, closed-circuit television video monitoring is becoming ubiquitous. On toll roads, automatic toll collection systems create a precise record of the movements of motorists who choose to make use of that convenience. Many motorists purchase cars that are equipped with devices that permit a central station to ascertain the car\u2019s location at any time so that roadside assistance may be provided if needed and the car may be found if it is stolen.\n\nPerhaps most significant, cell phones and other wireless devices now permit wireless carriers to track and record the location of users\u2014and as of June 2011, it has been reported, there were more than 322 million wireless devices in use in the United States. 8 For older phones, the accuracy of the location information depends on the den-sity of the tower network, but new \u201csmart phones,\u201d which are equipped with a GPS device, permit more precise tracking. For example, when a user activates the GPS on such a phone, a provider is able to monitor the phone\u2019s location and speed of movement and can then report back real-time traffic conditions after combining (\u201ccrowdsourcing\u201d) the speed of all such phones on any particular road. 9 Similarly, phone-location-tracking services are offered as \u201csocial\u201d tools, allowing consumers to find (or to avoid) others who enroll in these services. The availability and use of these and other new devices will continue to shape the average person\u2019s expectations about the privacy of his or her daily movements.\n\nV\n\nIn the pre-computer age, the greatest protections of privacy were neither constitutional nor statutory, but practical. Traditional surveillance for any extended period of time was difficult and costly and therefore rarely undertaken. The surveillance at issue in this case\u2014constant monitoring of the location of a vehicle for four weeks\u2014would have required a large team of agents, multiple vehicles, and perhaps aerial assistance. 10 Only an investigation of unusual importance could have justified such an expenditure of law enforcement resources. Devices like the one used in the present case, however, make long-term monitoring relatively easy and cheap. In circumstances involving dramatic technological change, the best solution to privacy concerns may be legislative. See, e.g., Kerr, 102 Mich. L. Rev., at 805\u2013806. A legislative body is well situated to gauge changing public attitudes, to draw detailed lines, and to balance privacy and public safety in a comprehensive way.\n\nTo date, however, Congress and most States have not enacted statutes regulating the use of GPS tracking technology for law enforcement purposes. The best that we can do in this case is to apply existing Fourth Amendment doctrine and to ask whether the use of GPS tracking in a particular case involved a degree of intrusion that a reasonable person would not have anticipated.\n\nUnder this approach, relatively short-term monitoring of a person\u2019s movements on public streets accords with expectations of privacy that our society has recognized as reasonable. See Knotts, 460 U. S., at 281\u2013282. But the use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses impinges on expectations of privacy. For such offenses, society\u2019s expectation has been that law enforcement agents and others would not\u2014and indeed, in the main, simply could not\u2014secretly monitor and catalogue every single movement of an individual\u2019s car for a very long period. In this case, for four weeks, law enforcement agents tracked every movement that respondent made in the vehicle he was driving. We need not identify with precision the point at which the tracking of this vehicle became a search, for the line was surely crossed before the 4-week mark. Other cases may present more difficult questions. But where uncertainty exists with respect to whether a certain period of GPS surveillance is long enough to constitute a Fourth Amendment search, the police may always seek a warrant. 11 We also need not consider whether prolonged GPS monitoring in the context of investigations involving extraordinary offenses would similarly intrude on a constitutionally protected sphere of privacy. In such cases, long-term tracking might have been mounted using previously available techniques.\n\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\nFor these reasons, I conclude that the lengthy monitoring that occurred in this case constituted a search under the Fourth Amendment. I therefore agree with the majority that the decision of the Court of Appeals must be affirmed.\n\nNotes\n1 Although the record does not reveal the size or weight of the device used in this case, there is now a device in use that weighs two ounces and is the size of a credit card. Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.\n\n2 At common law, a suit for trespass to chattels could be maintained if there was a violation of \u201cthe dignitary interest in the inviolability of chattels,\u201d but today there must be \u201csome actual damage to the chattel before the action can be maintained.\u201d W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser & Keeton on Law of Torts 87 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser & Keeton). Here, there was no actual damage to the vehicle to which the GPS device was attached.\n\n3 The Court suggests that something like this might have occurred in 1791, but this would have required either a gigantic coach, a very tiny constable, or both\u2014not to mention a constable with incredible fortitude and patience.\n\n4 See, e.g., Cal.

Knotts, 460 U. S. 276 (1983) , or United States v. Karo, 468 U. S. 705 (1984) , such long-term surveillance would have been exceptionally demanding. The beepers used in those cases merely \u201cemit[ted] periodic signals that [could] be picked up by a radio receiver.\u201d Knotts, 460 U.S., at 277. The signal had a limited range and could be lost if the police did not stay close enough. Indeed, in Knotts itself, officers lost the signal from the beeper, and only \u201cwith the assistance of a monitoring device located in a helicopter [was] the approximate location of the signal . . . picked up again about one hour later.\u201d Id., at 278.\n\n11 In this case, the agents obtained a warrant, but they did not comply with two of the warrant\u2019s restrictions: They did not install the GPS device within the 10-day period required by the terms of the warrant and by Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 41(e)(2)(B)(i), and they did not install the GPS device within the District of Columbia, as required by the terms of the warrant and by 18 U. S. C. \u00a73117(a) and Rule 41(b)(4). In the courts below the Government did not argue, and has not argued here, that the Fourth Amendment does not impose these precise restrictions and that the violation of these restrictions does not demand the suppression of evidence obtained using the tracking device. See, e.g., United States v. Gerber, 994 F. 2d 1556, 1559\u20131560 (CA11 1993); United States v. Burke, 517 F. 2d 377, 386\u2013387 (CA2 1975).

(RAPCO), his former employer, and attempted to sell the data to one of RAPCO's competitors. \u2002 He allows that his acts violated \u00a7\u20021832, if the data contained \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d but denies that the data met the statutory definition:\n\nthe term \u201ctrade secret\u201d means all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or codes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether or how stored, compiled, or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing if-(A) the owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret; \u2009and (B) the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, the public[.]\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20021839(3). \u2002 Lange's appeal requires us to apply this definition.\n\nRAPCO is in the business of making aircraft parts for the aftermarket. \u2002 It buys original equipment parts, then disassembles them to identify (and measure) each component. \u2002 This initial step of reverse engineering, usually performed by a drafter such as Lange, produces a set of measurements and drawings. \u2002 See generally Pamela Samuelson & Suzanne Scotchmer, The Law and Economics of Reverse Engineering, 111 Yale L.J. 1575, 1582-94 (2002). \u2002 Because this case involves an effort to sell the intellectual property used to make a brake assembly, we use brakes as an illustration.\n\nKnowing exactly what a brake assembly looks like does not enable RAPCO to make a copy. \u2002 It must figure out how to make a substitute with the same (or better) technical specifications. \u2002 Brakes rely on friction to slow the airplane's speed by converting kinetic energy to heat. \u2002 Surfaces that do this job well are made by sintering-the forming of solid metal, usually from a powder, without melting. \u2002 Aftermarket manufacturers must experiment with different alloys and compositions until they achieve a process and product that fulfils requirements set by the Federal Aviation Administration for each brake assembly. \u2002 Completed assemblies must be exhaustively tested to demonstrate, to the FAA's satisfaction, that all requirements have been met; \u2009only then does the FAA certify the part for sale. \u2002 For brakes this entails 100 destructive tests on prototypes, bringing a spinning 60-ton wheel to a halt at a specified deceleration measured by a dynamometer. \u2002 Further testing of finished assemblies is required. It takes RAPCO a year or two to design, and obtain approval for, a complex part; \u2009the dynamometer testing alone can cost $75,000. \u2002 But the process of experimenting and testing can be avoided if the manufacturer demonstrates that its parts are identical (in composition and manufacturing processes) to parts that have already been certified. \u2002 What Lange, a disgruntled former employee, offered for sale was all the information required to obtain certification of several components as identical to parts for which RAPCO held certification. \u2002 Lange included with the package-which he offered via the Internet to anyone willing to pay his price of $100,000-a pirated copy of AutoCAD\u00ae, the computer-assisted drawing software that RAPCO uses to maintain its drawings and specifications data. \u2002 One person to whom Lange tried to peddle the data informed RAPCO, which turned to the FBI. Lange was arrested following taped negotiations that supply all the evidence necessary for conviction-if the data satisfy the statutory definition of trade secrets.\n\n\u2003One ingredient of a trade secret is that \u201cthe owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret\u201d. \u2002 Lange contends that the proof fell short, but a sensible trier of fact (in this bench trial, the district judge) could have concluded that RAPCO took \u201creasonable measures to keep [the] information secret\u201d. \u2002 RAPCO stores all of its drawings and manufacturing data in its CAD room, which is protected by a special lock, an alarm system, and a motion detector. \u2002 The number of copies of sensitive information is kept to a minimum; \u2009surplus copies are shredded. \u2002 Some information in the plans is coded, and few people know the keys to these codes. \u2002 Drawings and other manufacturing information contain warnings of RAPCO's intellectual-property rights; \u2009every employee receives a notice that the information with which he works is confidential. \u2002 None of RAPCO's subcontractors receives full copies of the schematics; \u2009by dividing the work among vendors, RAPCO ensures that none can replicate the product. \u2002 This makes it irrelevant that RAPCO does not require vendors to sign confidentiality agreements; \u2009it relies on deeds (the splitting of tasks) rather than promises to maintain confidentiality. \u2002 Although, as Lange says, engineers and drafters knew where to get the key to the CAD room door, keeping these employees out can't be an ingredient of \u201creasonable measures to keep [the] information secret\u201d; \u2009then no one could do any work. \u2002 So too with plans sent to subcontractors, which is why dissemination to suppliers does not undermine a claim of trade secret. \u2002 See Rockwell Graphic Systems, Inc. v. DEV Industries, Inc., 925 F.2d 174, 177 (7th Cir.1991).\n\nThe second ingredient is that \u201cthe information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, the public[.]\u201d \u2002According to Lange, all data obtained by reverse engineering some other product are \u201creadily ascertainable \u2024 by the public\u201d because everyone can do what RAPCO did: \u2009buy an original part, disassemble and measure it, and make a copy. \u2002 The prosecutor responds to this contention by observing that \u201cthe public\u201d is unable to reverse engineer an aircraft brake assembly.\n\nThe prosecutor's assumption is that the statutory reference in \u00a7\u20021839(3) to \u201cthe public\u201d means the general public-the man in the street. \u2002 Ordinary people don't have AutoCAD and 60-ton flywheels ready to hand. \u2002 But is the general public the right benchmark? \u2002 The statute itself does not give an answer: \u2009the word \u201cpublic\u201d could be preceded implicitly by \u201cgeneral\u201d as the prosecutor supposes, but it also could be preceded implicitly by \u201ceducated\u201d or \u201ceconomically important\u201d or any of many other qualifiers. \u2002 Once we enter the business of adding words to flesh out the statute-and even the addition of \u201cgeneral\u201d to \u201cpublic\u201d does this-it usually is best to ask what function the law serves. \u2002 In criminal cases it also is important to inquire whether the unelaborated text is ambiguous, because if it is the language should be read to prevent surprises. \u2002 That's the function of the Rule of Lenity. \u2002 See Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 619, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994). \u2002 Some elaboration is needed. \u2002 Although the third circuit assumed in United States v. Hsu, 155 F.3d 189, 196 (3d Cir.1998), that \u201cgeneral\u201d belongs in front of \u201cpublic,\u201d it did not explain why (nor was this important to, or a part of, Hsu\u2009's holding). \u2002 Commentators disagree about who \u201cthe public\u201d includes. \u2002 Compare Geraldine Szott Moohr, The Problematic Role of Criminal Law in Regulating the Use of Information: \u2009The Case of the Economic Espionage Act, 80 N.C. L.Rev. 853, 878-79 (2002), with Arthur J. Schwab & David J. Porter, Guarding the Crown Jewels: \u2009A Guide to Protecting Your Trade Secrets 85-86 (2002). \u2002 It is therefore worth a look-though it turns out not to be dispositive here, any more than it was in Hsu.\n\nA problem with using the general public as the reference group for identifying a trade secret is that many things unknown to the public at large are well known to engineers, scientists, and others whose intellectual property the Economic Espionage Act was enacted to protect. \u2002 This makes the general public a poor benchmark for separating commercially valuable secrets from obscure (but generally known) information. \u2002 Suppose that Lange had offered to sell Avogadro's number for $1. Avogadro's number, 6.02 x 1023, is the number of molecules per mole of gas. \u2002 It is an important constant, known to chemists since 1909 but not to the general public (or even to all recent graduates of a chemistry class). \u2002 We can't believe that Avogadro's number could be called a trade secret. \u2002 Other principles are known without being comprehended. \u2002 Most people know that E = mc2, but a pop quiz of the general public would reveal that they do not understand what this means or how it can be used productively.\n\nOne might respond that the context of the word \u201cpublic\u201d addresses this concern. \u2002 The full text of \u00a7\u20021839(3)(B) is: \u2009\u201cthe information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, the public\u201d. \u2002 Avogadro's number and other obscure knowledge is not \u201cgenerally known to\u201d the man in the street but might be deemed \u201creadily ascertainable to\u201d this hypothetical person. \u2002 It appears in any number of scientific handbooks. \u2002 Similarly one can visit a library and read Einstein's own discussion of his famous equation. \u2002 See Albert Einstein, Relativity: \u2009The Special and General Theory (1920). \u2002 Members of the general public can ascertain even abstruse information, such as Schr\u00f6dinger's quantum field equation, by consulting people in the know-as high school dropouts can take advantage of obscure legal rules by hiring lawyers. \u2002 But this approach uses the phrase \u201creadily available\u201d to treat the \u201cgeneral public\u201d as if it were more technically competent, which poses the question whether it would be better to use a qualifier other than \u201cgeneral\u201d in the first place.\n\n\u2003Section 1839(3) was derived from the definition of a trade secret in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which many states have adopted. \u2002 Section 1(4) of the Uniform Act provides:\n\n\u201cTrade secret\u201d means information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that:\n\n(i)\u2002derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and\n\n(ii)\u2002is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\n\nSection 1839(3)(B) replaces \u201cpersons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use\u201d with \u201cthe public\u201d. \u2002 The prosecutor believes that the substitution supports the conclusion that Congress referred to the general public. \u2002 Yet one could say instead that \u201cthe public\u201d is shorthand for the longer phrase, which then would be read as \u201cthe economically relevant public\u201d-that is, the persons whose ignorance of the information is the source of its economic value. \u2002 Let us recur to the statutory context of \u201cthe public\u201d:\n\nthe information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, the public[.]\n\nSection 1839(3)(B) as a whole refers to the source of economic value-that the information is not known to or easily discoverable by persons who could use it productively. \u2002 To make this work, either the phrase \u201creadily ascertainable\u201d or the phrase \u201cthe public\u201d must be understood to concentrate attention on either potential users of the information, or proxies for them (which is to say, persons who have the same ability to \u201cascertain\u201d the information). \u2002 And for purposes of this case those people would be engineers and manufacturers of aircraft parts, who have ample means to reverse engineer their competitors' products. \u2002 It is by keeping secrets from its rivals that RAPCO captures the returns of its design and testing work. \u2002 Thus it is unnecessary here to decide whether \u201cgeneral\u201d belongs in front of \u201cpublic\u201d-for even if it does, the economically valuable information is not \u201creadily ascertainable\u201d to the general public, the educated public, the economically relevant public, or any sensible proxy for these groups.\n\nAnother line of prosecutorial argument starts with the fact that \u00a7\u20021832(a)(4) makes it a crime to attempt to sell trade secrets without the owner's permission. \u2002 Even if Lange did not have real trade secrets in his possession, the argument goes, he thought he did and therefore may be penalized for an attempted sale. \u2002 The argument finds support in Hsu, which held that in order to avoid graymail-the threat that to obtain a conviction the prosecutor must disclose the secret by putting it in the trial record-a case may be based on \u00a7\u20021832(a)(4) without disclosing all details of the trade secret. \u2002 Accord, United States v. Pin Yen Yang, 281 F.3d 534, 543-44 (6th Cir.2002). \u2002 We agree with the general approach of these decisions. \u2002Hsu analogized the attempted sale of information believed to be a trade secret to an attempt such as shooting a corpse, believing it to be alive, or selling sugar, believing it to be cocaine. \u2002 Events of this sort underlie the maxim that factual impossibility is no defense to a prosecution for attempt. \u2002 See United States v. Bailey, 227 F.3d 792, 797 (7th Cir.2000); \u2009United States v. Saunders, 166 F.3d 907, 916 (7th Cir.1999); \u2009United States v. Cotts, 14 F.3d 300, 307 (7th Cir.1994). \u2002 This does not mean, however, that the defendant's belief alone can support a conviction. \u2002 All attempt prosecutions depend on demonstrating that the defendant took a substantial step toward completion of the offense, which could have been carried out unless thwarted. \u2002 Braxton v. United States, 500 U.S. 344, 111 S.Ct. 1854, 114 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). \u2002 Although the American Law Institute recommends a definition of attempt linked closely to intent, Model Penal Code \u00a7\u20025.01(1)(c), the Supreme Court has not embraced this view and demands in cases under federal law that the prosecutor establish a probability of success. \u2002 See, e.g., Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 113 S.Ct. 884, 122 L.Ed.2d 247 (1993) ( \u201cdangerous probability\u201d of success is an ingredient of attempted monopolization).\n\nAn attempted murder may be thwarted by substituting a sack of flour for the intended victim; \u2009a sale of drugs may be thwarted by substituting sugar for cocaine, or rock candy for crack. \u2002 These situations present a good chance of success, but for the intervention. \u2002 So does \u201cthe disgruntled former employee who walks out of his former company with a computer diskette full of engineering schematics\u201d (Hsu, 155 F.3d at 201)-a fair description of Lange's conduct (though diskettes are obsolete). \u2002 See also United States v. Martin, 228 F.3d 1, 10-12 (1st Cir.2000). \u2002 A sale of trade secrets may be thwarted by substituting a disk with the collected works of Shakespeare for the disk that the defendant believed contained the plans for brake assemblies, or by an inadvertent failure to download the proper file. \u2002 The attempted sale of the disk is a culpable substantial step. \u2002 But it is far less clear that sale of information already known to the public could be deemed a substantial step toward the offense, just because the defendant is deluded and does not understand what a trade secret is. \u2002 Selling a copy of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is not attempted economic espionage, even if the defendant thinks that the tips in the book are trade secrets; \u2009nor is sticking pins in voodoo dolls attempted murder. \u2002 Booksellers and practitioners of the occult pose no social dangers, certainly none of the magnitude of those who are tricked into shooting bags of sand that have been substituted for targets of assassination. \u2002 Lange was more dangerous than our bookseller but much less dangerous than our hypothetical assassin. \u2002 Perhaps data purloined from an ex-employer is sufficiently likely to contain trade secrets to justify calling the preparation for sale a substantial step toward completion of the offense, and thus a culpable attempt, even if the employee stole the wrong data file and did not get his hands on the commercially valuable information. \u2002 We need not pursue the subject beyond noting the plausibility of the claim and its sensitivity to the facts-what kind of data did the employee think he stole, and so on. \u2002 For it is not necessary to announce a definitive rule about how dangerous the completed acts must be in trade secret cases: \u2009the judge was entitled to (and did) find that Lange had real trade secrets in his possession.\n\nLange wants us to proceed as if all he tried to sell were measurements that anyone could have taken with calipers after disassembling an original-equipment part. \u2002 Such measurements could not be called trade secrets if, as Lange asserts, the assemblies in question were easy to take apart and measure. \u2002 But no one would have paid $100,000 for metes and bounds, while Lange told his customers that the data on offer were worth more than that asking price. \u2002 Which they were. \u2002 What Lange had, and tried to sell, were the completed specifications and engineering diagrams that reflected all the work completed after the measurements had been taken: \u2009the metallurgical data, details of the sintering, the results of the tests, the plans needed to produce the finished goods, everything required to get FAA certification of a part supposedly identical to one that had been approved. \u2002 Those details \u201cderive[d] independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, the public[.]\u201d \u2002Every firm other than the original equipment manufacturer and RAPCO had to pay dearly to devise, test, and win approval of similar parts; \u2009the details unknown to the rivals, and not discoverable with tape measures, had considerable \u201cindependent economic value \u2024 from not being generally known\u201d. \u2002 A sensible trier of fact could determine that Lange tried to sell trade secrets. It was his customer's cooperation with the FBI, and not public access to the data, that prevented closing of the sale.\u2020\n\n\u2003Thirty months' imprisonment is the sentence Lange is serving. \u2002 Not much, as sentences go these days, but Lange says it is too high. \u2002 He protests two decisions that influenced its length: \u2009first, the district judge's conclusion that he used special skill, which adds two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u20023B1.3; \u2009second, the judge's refusal to deduct two levels for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u20023E1.1. Appellate review of these contentions is deferential, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20023742(e); \u2009Buford v. United States, 532 U.S. 59, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001); \u2009United States v. Gomez, 24 F.3d 924, 926 (7th Cir.1994), and the district judge did not abuse his discretion.\n\n\u2003The judge concluded that Lange's knowledge as a drafter (he has an associate's degree in graphic design) and his ability to manipulate drawings in AutoCAD were special skills that facilitated the offense. \u2002 The former enabled Lange to select and lay his hands on commercially valuable data; \u2009the latter helped facilitate its sale and concealment. \u2002 When negotiating for the sale, Lange used AutoCAD to remove all of RAPCO's identifying marks and replace them with the logos and other details of the potential customer, so that the buyer could submit the drawings to the FAA as its own. \u2002 That manipulation would have made the package more attractive to any buyer and thus facilitated the offense.\n\nLange relies on Application Note 3 to \u00a7\u20023B1.3:\n\n\u201cSpecial skill\u201d refers to a skill not possessed by members of the general public and usually requiring substantial education, training or licensing. \u2002 Examples would include pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, chemists, and demolition experts.\n\nSure he had training, Lange concedes, but not as extensive as a chemist's. \u2002 That cannot be denied; \u2009an associate's degree (and knowledge of even so complex a software package as AutoCAD) can be obtained in less time than a college degree. \u2002 But the district court did not commit a clear error in finding that Lange had skills \u201cnot possessed by members of the general public\u201d (this time \u201cpublic\u201d does mean \u201cgeneral public\u201d!). \u2002United States v. Lewis, 41 F.3d 1209 (7th Cir.1994), makes the point. \u2002Lewis holds that an enhancement under \u00a7\u20023B1.3 may be proper for someone whose special skill is ability to drive an 18-wheel truck, making off with the load with which he had been entrusted. \u2002 Drafting skills, including the use of AutoCAD, are \u201cnot possessed by members of the general public\u201d, require time to master, and played a central role in the offense. \u2002 A mechanical drafter is in the same category as a pilot or demolition expert-for those skills, too, may be learned outside the academy. \u2002 The enhancement was proper.\n\n\u2003As for acceptance of responsibility: \u2009this reduction usually rewards a guilty plea, but Lange went to trial. \u2002 Even on appeal Lange contends that he is not guilty and asks us to reverse his conviction. That does not qualify as acceptance of responsibility. \u2002 Nor does it fall within the special case, see \u00a7\u20023E1.1 Application Note 2, of pleading not guilty only to obtain a ruling on a contested legal issue. \u2002 Lange argued (and still argues) factual as well as legal innocence. \u2002 His legal points could have been preserved with a conditional guilty plea on stipulated facts, but instead Lange chose to put the prosecution to its proof.\n\nWhat is more, he hardly fits the profile of one who has learned his lesson. \u2002 Lange consulted an attorney before offering RAPCO's data for sale. \u2002 Counsel told him that he absolutely should not sell the data; \u2009armed with that knowledge, Lange went ahead and tried to complete the sale. \u2002 After being caught, Lange committed new offenses. \u2002 He was directed by a grand jury subpoena (and required by the civil law) to return the stolen data. \u2002 He feigned compliance while retaining an electronic copy. \u2002 Then he tried to persuade a friend who knew the truth to lie to the grand jury. \u2002 Only when this effort was revealed (the friend turned a damning voice mail message over to the FBI) did Lange finally clean his hard drive of RAPCO's intellectual property. \u2002 For this escapade Lange received a two-level enhancement for obstructing justice. \u2002U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u20023C1.1. An obstruction-of-justice enhancement generally, and here, is incompatible with an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. \u2002 U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u20023E1.1 Application Note 4.\n\nAffirmed\n\nI concur in the judgment of the court. \u2002 I write separately because the panel majority's opinion deals with several matters that are not necessarily raised by this case, and, in my view, it is imprudent to confront these issues prematurely.\n\nThe panel majority notes that the Economic Espionage Act, in defining \u201ctrade secret,\u201d includes as an ingredient that\n\nthe information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, the public[.]\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20021839(3)(B). \u2002This portion of the definition of a trade secret differs markedly from the definition found in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The analogous language, found at section 1(4) of the Uniform Act, provides that the information must\n\nderive[\u2009] independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use[.]\n\nUnif. Trade Secrets Act, \u00a7\u20021(4) (amended 1985), 14 U.L.A. 438 (1979).\n\nThe panel majority declares that this textual difference is of no significance because the phrase \u201cthe public\u201d in the federal statute is simply shorthand for the longer phrase of the Uniform Act. Therefore, the panel majority concludes, \u201cthe public\u201d ought to be read \u201cthe economically relevant public.\u201d \u2002(Op. at 267). \u2002 Because Mr. Lange offered information that was unknown to both competitors and to the general public, there is no reason to confront this issue in this case, and, because the correctness of the panel majority's reading of the evidence is not self-evident, we ought not to reject out-of-hand the position of the United States when there is no necessity to do so.\n\nThe panel majority bases its reading of the federal statute on its conclusion that \u201c[s]ection 1839(3) was derived from the definition of a trade secret in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.\u201d (Op. at 267). \u2002 An examination of the House Report accompanying the statute describes, however, a somewhat more nuanced relationship between the two definitions. \u2002 Notably, the Report states that the definition of \u201ctrade secret\u201d in the federal statute is \u201cbased largely\u201d on the definition of that term in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. H.R.Rep. No. 104-788, at 12 (1996), U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 4021, 4030-31. \u2002 The report goes on to say in the paragraphs immediately following that \u201cinformation which is generally known to the public, or which the public can readily ascertain through proper means, does not satisfy the definition of trade secret under this section.\u201d \u2002Id. at 13, U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 4031.\n\nOur normal approach to statutory interpretation is to assume that Congress intended what it wrote. \u2002 Here, the words of the statute are clear on their face. \u2002 Moreover, the pertinent legislative history supports reliance on the plain wording. \u2002 Cf. Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564, 574, 102 S.Ct. 3245, 73 L.Ed.2d 973 (1982) (\u201cResort to the legislative history, therefore, merely confirms that Congress intended the statute to mean exactly what its plain language says.\u201d). \u2002 Congress used the Uniform Act's definition of \u201ctrade secret\u201d as a guide, but it did not adopt it. \u2002 Instead, Congress made its own choices as to those aspects of the Uniform Act's definition that ought to be adopted and those that needed alteration before incorporation into the federal statute. \u2002 I see no reason to reject so swiftly and gratuitously the plain wording of the statute, the supportive legislative history,1 the interpretation of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in United States v. Hsu, 155 F.3d 189, 196-97 (3d Cir.1998), and the interpretation of the Executive Branch set forth in the Government's brief.\n\nI would also defer announcing any limitations on the law of attempt as it applies to the Economic Espionage Act in advance of the necessity of doing so. \u2002 The considered judgment of another circuit to the contrary particularly counsels restraint in this respect. \u2002 See Hsu, 155 F.3d at 198-203. \u2002 In this case, there is no question that the information Mr. Lange offered for sale was a trade secret. \u2002 We therefore need not decide whether a defendant can be found guilty of an attempt when no such secret exists.\n\nFor these reasons, I concur in the judgment, but must respectfully decline from joining the panel discussion of matters not necessary for decision today, especially when the correctness of those pronouncements is questionable.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\nFOOTNOTE.  \u2009This opinion, the circuit's first encounter with the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, was circulated before release to all active judges under Circuit Rule 40(e). \u2002 Circuit Judge Ripple favored a hearing en banc.\n\n1.  \u2003I note that legislative history is employed here merely to confirm the plain wording of the statutory language in the face of a reading that can find no justification in the plain wording, the legislative history or any other recognized tool of statutory construction.\n\nEASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge.", "annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 47}, {"start": 48, "end": 135}, {"start": 138, "end": 150}, {"start": 155, "end": 181},

On appeal, defendant contends that: (1) the cyberstalking statute (720 ILCS 5/2-7.5(a)(1) (West 2008)) violated his first amendment right to free speech and is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague; (2) his convictions for cyberstalking and harassment through electronic communication violate the one-act, one-crime rule; (3) the State failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of cyberstalking, harassment *1235 through electronic communication, and stalking; and (4) his case should be remanded for a proper inquiry into his pro se allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, as required by People v. Krankel, 102 Ill. 2d 181, 80 Ill. Dec. 62, 464 N.E.2d 1045 (1984). For the following reasons, we affirm in part and vacate in part.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nAt trial, Heather Stern testified that she is 35 years old and lives with her 6-year-old son, who is autistic, in an apartment in Park Ridge, Illinois. In spring 2006, Stern's home flooded and she sought temporary housing while she was involved in negotiations with her insurance company. Stern testified that she met defendant, a 43-year-old Serbian immigrant, through an online roommate matching service. Stern testified that although she did not become roommates with defendant, she maintained a friendship with defendant and met him on a monthly basis for coffee. Stern explained that she was interested in learning more of the Serbian language and defendant wanted to improve his English.\n\nIn July 2006, defendant and several other people helped Stern and her son move into a new apartment in Park Ridge, Illinois. Stern testified that, around that same time, she began working for defendant's granite business. Stern testified that she worked from home and performed general office work for defendant, including contacting clients, customer service, and bookkeeping. Defendant began staying overnight periodically at Stern's apartment while he was looking for a new apartment. Defendant did not have a key to Stern's apartment, but since Stern worked from home and had her son, she was usually home. At the time, defendant and Stern's son had a close relationship. Stern testified that defendant was supposed to pay her rent in addition to her salary. Stern testified that defendant often paid her in cash and would alternatively designate it as rent or pay, but still be behind on both. Stern testified that as a result, she and defendant argued about his payments and she ultimately quit working for defendant in November or December 2006.\n\nStern also testified that defendant's behavior changed in the summer of 2006. Stern testified that when she first met defendant \"[h]e was very much a gentlemen.\" Stern testified that defendant became \"pushy,\" \"didn't respect boundaries,\" and \"wasn't predictable.\" Stern testified that she informed defendant that she was not interested in a romantic relationship with him, but defendant \"wouldn't take no for an answer.\" Stern testified, \"[Defendant] had beliefs about how women should be * * * and I didn't understand them and my refusal to agree with them was met with * * * you're a bitch or you are stuck up or * * * it makes you a slut, you must want to sleep with other men if you don't want to commit to me.\" Stern testified that she \"wasn't comfortable with how [defendant] was dealing with the business or the personal relationship\" and defendant stopped staying at her apartment on October 17 or October 18, 2006.\n\nStern testified that during the early morning hours on January 27, 2007, she was asleep on the couch in her living room when she heard a \"jingling noise\" from the back door handle \"as if someone were attempting to open it.\" Stern testified that she became alarmed because no one ever used the back door and her son was asleep in his bedroom. Stern testified that she could not find her cellular phone, so she got a knife from the kitchen and ran to the back door. Stern testified that she *1236 slammed her weight against the back door and locked it as defendant was trying to open the door. Stern testified that defendant began screaming expletives at her, calling her a \"bitch\" and asking her, \"Why are you doing this?\" Stern testified that she \"just freaked out\" and did not call the police immediately because she \"knew\" defendant. Stern subsequently made a police report.\n\nStern testified that after the January 27, 2007 incident, defendant continued to leave her voice mail messages and send her e-mails. On February 19, 2006, Stern discovered that someone had deflated the tires on her car.\n\nStern testified that on March 13, 2007, she received a number of e-mails and voice mail messages from defendant. Stern identified People's exhibit 2, as an e-mail that defendant sent to her on March 13, 2007, at 1:57 a.m., which was part in English and part in Serbian.[1] The parties stipulated to translations into English from Serbian made by an official Serbian translator, Ivanka Kailovski. The subject of the e-mail was in Serbian and translated as \"Lamb and its father=ME.\" The e-mail stated:\n\n\"MOLIM TE RAZMISLI STA RADIS\nKADA DODJEM U PROBLEM, WITH FUTURE (BUDUCE VREME, FUTURE)\nJA CU DA SE UBIJEM\n(MY LIFE WILL VANISH) OR I WILL DO A SUACIDE [sic]\nand ... I TEBE VODIM SA SOBOM = MEANS `I WILL END MY LIFE AND I AM TAKEING [sic] you with me\n[OR]\nI'LL GIVE YOU AN OFFER!\nIN ORDER NOT TO REPORT YOU TO STATE FARM, CALLING FEDS ON INSURANCE FRAUD, AS A CON, WHICH IS FEDERAL OFFENSE, AND NO BOND, MONEY, BROTHER, CAN SAVE YOU FROM JAIL, MEANING 5 YEARS MIN., I'LL GIVE YOU AN OPTION, CONTRACT\nSO CONTACT ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE\nTHANK YOU\nEYE FOR EYE, NOW THERE IS NO MOMENT FOR MERCY\nYOU DID NOT HAD [sic] FOR ME\nLET ME SHOW YOU WHO IS THE MAN\"\nThe parties stipulated that the interpreter would testify that \"the initial Serbian written on the email says please think what you are doing. When I am in a problem in the future, I will commit suicide, my life will vanish or I will do suicide and I will take you with me.\"\n\nStern next identified People's exhibit 4, a compact disc containing recordings of eight voice mail messages left by defendant on Stern's phone. These voice mails included a message left on March 13, 2007, at 2:57 a.m., after defendant sent the e-mail contained in People's exhibit 2, in which defendant asked Stern, inter alia, to read his e-mail, acknowledged deflating Stern's car tires, and indicated that Stern *1237 \"should call [him] back * * * for [her] sake.\" Defendant stated that \"a person [who] is being destroyed * * * should get even\" and \"if I get even, I get even big time, trust me.\" Defendant further stated that \"this is your choice, you and me together or this * * * insurance fraud\" and that he \"would not have done this unless it was in a matter of love.\"\n\nStern next identified People's exhibit 5, which was a second e-mail that defendant sent to her on March 13, 2007, at 3:31 a.m. In this e-mail, defendant threatened to report Stern for insurance fraud unless she agreed to marry him. The e-mail then stated, in relevant part:\n\n\"YOU KILLED MY HEART, I WILL GET EVEN\n* * *\nDEAL IS ME OR YOU KNOW ... TRY ME\nI AM SO DESPERATE I DO NOT MIND DYING AS OF NOW\nTRY ME KILLER\"\nStern testified that after receiving the second e-mail, defendant left her another phone voice mail message on March 13, 2007, at 4:09 a.m. The State introduced this voice mail message as People's Exhibit 6, in which defendant directed Stern to check her e-mail and stated, inter alia, \"I'm dead. I'm a dead person without you and [your son]. So, I will take you with me. * * * I need you with me * * * in heaven, okay?\"\n\nStern testified that defendant's voice mail messages, e-mails, and the January 27, 2007 attempted break-in made her feel \"scared\" and she \"very much so\" felt threatened. Stern testified that from defendant's voice mail messages and e-mails, she surmised that defendant took her receipts that she had submitted to her insurance company when her home had flooded and that defendant was going to claim that the receipts were fraudulent.\n\nStern's neighbors, Jennifer Uslais and Jim Dobrowski, testified that on February 19, 2007, at about 8:30 p.m., they heard noises in the hallway of their apartment building. Uslais testified that she saw defendant in the hallway between her apartment door and Stern's apartment door directly across the hall. Defendant told Uslais that \"he wanted to talk to [her] about [her] neighbor\" and asked her to come out to the hallway to talk to him. Uslais declined and told defendant that if he did not leave, she would call the police. About an hour later, Dobrowski testified that defendant returned and Dobrowski observed him \"caress\" Stern's door knob and door frame. Dobrowski testified that he thought defendant was trying to break into Stern's apartment and Dobrowski directed Uslais to call the police. Dobrowski went into the hallway with his samurai sword and told defendant to leave the apartment building. Defendant responded that Stern was \"doing some kind of witchcraft.\" Dobrowski testified that defendant finally left the building and the police arrived shortly thereafter.\n\nDefendant testified that he met Stern through a roommate matching service and met her for coffee on two occasions. In July 2006, defendant helped Stern move into a new apartment and, about a week later, they began a sexual relationship. Defendant testified that Stern became pregnant in October 2006, but miscarried in November 2006. Defendant testified that Stern then asked him to have a vasectomy because she did not want to have any more children. Defendant testified that *1238 throughout the summer and fall of 2006, he stayed in Stern's apartment but did not have a key to the apartment. Defendant testified that he became friends with Stern's son, who is autistic, and that he had special abilities to deal with autistic children from his previous employment transporting children to special schools. Defendant testified that during this time, he gave Stern the passwords to his e-mail accounts. Defendant testified that he moved out of Stern's apartment in December 2006. Defendant acknowledged that he had a laptop computer that \"was always with him\" and to which Stern had no access after he moved out.\n\nDefendant initially testified that Stern could have \"manipulated\" the e-mails in question, but defendant testified that he recognized the e-mails and voice mail messages that he sent Stern on March 13, 2007. Defendant testified that he was \"just depressed\" at the time and that he was \"being used for money.\" Defendant testified that his statement that he was going to kill himself and take Stern with him was \"just spiritual\" and \"a figure of speech.\" Defendant testified that at the time his \"heart was broken\" and he had no intention of killing himself or Stern. Defendant testified that his statement that Stern killed his heart and that he would get even meant that \"she would be alone.\" Defendant testified, \"It doesn't mean to kill as you claim * * *. Killing heart is a spiritual thing.\" Defendant testified that when he stated that he would kill \"every spirit that messes with my spirit\" he meant it in an emotional way but may have expressed himself the wrong way because English was not his native language. Defendant testified that his statements regarding the \"insurance fraud\" related to the fact that after he moved of Stern's apartment, he discovered his receipts had been reorganized into Stern's own files. As a result, defendant believed Stern was using his receipts for claims on her insurance. Defendant testified that Stern had offered to marry him on December 15, 2006 \"under certain conditions\" and that his message to Stern was promising \"to come through as she requested.\" Defendant also testified that if Stern did not marry him, he threatened to turn her in for the alleged insurance fraud. Defendant testified that he was heartbroken about her breaking up with him and threatened to turn Stern in, but maintained, \"I have done nothing.\"\n\nDuring cross-examination, defendant acknowledged that he did not have a Serbian interpreter at trial and was not in fear of being misunderstood during his testimony. Defendant testified that he has been in this country for 14 years, had a construction business that was fairly successful, and also had helped children with disabilities and spoke English to them.\n\nFollowing closing arguments, defendant was found guilty of cyberstalking, harassment through electronic communication, and stalking. The trial court rejected defendant's defense that his statements were not intended to be threats directed at Stern. The court found:\n\n\"[Defendant's] intent can be nothing other than that he was trying to impose his will on Ms. Stern and he says his will is he either wants her to marry him and become a family or he wants her to go to prison or he wants her dead. Those are the choices that she has.\nAnd the fact that she doesn't want to marry him is something that angers him. * * * [H]is idea of love is if I can't have you, then either I am going to kill myself and take you with me or I am *1239 going to make sure you go to prison. There's nothing in any of those communications that can be misconstrued.\nThe defendant wants me to believe that this is some sort of poetic license that when he says I am going to kill myself and take you with me that he is meaning something spiritual. I don't believe there's anything spiritual here. I think that the only purpose of him going on this assault, this attack during the night of March 13 was to threaten, to upset, was to intimidate, was to attack Ms. Stern.\nYou tried to force your way into her apartment. That was not successful. * * * What you did was nothing short of trying to terrorize this woman. * * * This is exactly why the cyberstalking and stalking laws were created for people like you. You wanted to terrorize her.\"\nDefendant was subsequently sentenced to concurrent terms of three years in prison on each count. Defendant now appeals.\n\nII. ANALYSIS\n\nWe begin our analysis with the pertinent statute. The cyberstalking statute in effect at the time defendant was charged provided:\n\n\"(a) A person commits cyberstalking when he or she, knowingly and without lawful justification, on at least 2 separate occasions, harasses another person through the use of electronic communication and:\n(1) at any time transmits a threat of immediate or future bodily harm, sexual assault, confinement, or restraint and the threat is directed towards that person or a family member of that person, or\n(2) places that person or a family member of that person in reasonable apprehension of immediate or future bodily harm, sexual assault, confinement, or restraint[.]\n* * *\n(b) As used in this Section:\n`Harass' means to engage in a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that alarms, torments, or terrorizes that person.\n`Electronic communication' means any transfer of signs, signals, writings, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectric, or photo-optical system. `Electronic communication' includes transmissions by a computer through the Internet to another computer.\n(c) Sentence. Cyberstalking is a Class 4 felony. A second or subsequent conviction for cyberstalking is a Class 3 felony.\" 720 ILCS 5/12-7.5 (West 2008).\nThe cyberstalking statute has been amended since defendant was charged and convicted. The most recent amendment became effective January 1, 2010 (see Pub. Act 96-686, \u00a7 5, eff. Jan. 1, 2010). In this appeal, however, we are called upon to only consider the constitutionality of the statute in effect at the time defendant was charged and convicted.\n\nA. Overbreadth\n\nDefendant first contends that the cyberstalking statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because it criminalizes \"a substantial amount of expression, much of which is protected by the First Amendment.\" To demonstrate, defendant sets forth several hypothetical situations in which he contends *1240 that the statute proscribes innocent conduct, such as when a threatening e-mail is sent with both parties knowing it is a practical joke. The State responds that the statute is not overbroad where it does not proscribe constitutionally protected speech and is, thus, constitutional.\n\nWe review constitutional challenges to a statute de novo. People v. Greco, 204 Ill. 2d 400, 407, 274 Ill. Dec. 73, 790 N.E.2d 846 (2003). The doctrine of overbreadth \"is designed to protect first amendment freedom of expression from laws written so broadly that the fear of punishment might discourage people from taking advantage of the freedom.\" People v. Bailey, 167 Ill. 2d 210, 226, 212 Ill. Dec. 608, 657 N.E.2d 953 (1995). The doctrine is used sparingly, and in order for a statute to be invalidated for overbreadth, its overbreadth \"`must not only be real, but substantial as well.'\" Bailey, 167 Ill.2d at 226, 212 Ill. Dec. 608, 657 N.E.2d 953, quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 615, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 2918,  37 L. Ed. 2d 830, 842 (1973).\n\nIn addressing a facial overbreadth challenge, the first task is to determine whether the statute reaches constitutionally protected speech, as defendant contends. See Bailey, 167 Ill.2d at 226, 212 Ill. Dec. 608, 657 N.E.2d 953. In viewing the cyberstalking statute, we find that defendant's facial overbreadth argument fails because the cyberstalking statute does not impinge on any constitutionally protected right of free speech.\n\nFor defendant to be convicted of cyberstalking, the State must prove that defendant \"knowingly and without lawful justification\" harassed the victim by transmitting \"a threat of immediate or future bodily harm, sexual assault, confinement, or restraint.\" 720 ILCS 5/12-7.5 (West 2008). The State must also prove that defendant transmitted such a threat on at least two separate occasions. 720 ILCS 5/12-7.5 (West 2008). It is clear that the statute was intended to only punish speech performed without lawful authority.\n\nIn Bailey, our supreme court rejected the defendant's argument that the stalking statute (720 ILCS 5/12-7.3 (West 1992)) was unconstitutionally overbroad because it reached speech protected by the first amendment. Bailey, 167 Ill.2d at 227-28, 212 Ill. Dec. 608, 657 N.E.2d 953. In Bailey, the stalking statute at issue provided:\n\n\"(a) A person commits stalking when he or she transmits to another person a threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable apprehension of death, bodily harm, sexual assault, confinement or restraint, and in furtherance of the threat knowingly does any one or more of the following acts on at least 2 separate occasions:\n(1) follows the person, other than within the residence of the defendant;\n(2) places the person under surveillance by remaining present outside his or her school, place of employment, vehicle, other place occupied by the person, or residence other than the residence of the defendant.\" 720 ILCS 5/12-7.3 (West 1992).\nIn upholding the statute, our supreme court explained, \"For defendant to be convicted of stalking, the State must prove that defendant threatened the victim `with the intent to place that person in reasonable apprehension of death, bodily harm, sexual assault, confinement or restraint.' In furtherance of the threat, the State must also prove that defendant followed *1241 the victim or placed the victim under surveillance on at least two separate occasions. Moreover, as previously explained, the statute was intended to only punish that conduct performed without lawful authority.\" Bailey, 167 Ill.2d at 226-27,  212 Ill. Dec. 608, 657 N.E.2d 953. Our supreme court noted that while the offense of stalking contained an element of speech, that speech was not constitutionally protected. The court explained, \"`Where speech is an integral part of unlawful conduct, it has no constitutional protection.'\" Bailey, 167 Ill.2d at 227, 212 Ill. Dec. 608, 657 N.E.2d 953, quoting Chicago Real Estate Board v. City of Chicago, 36 Ill. 2d 530, 552-53, 224 N.E.2d 793 (1967).\n\nHere, defendant argues that, unlike the stalking statute in Bailey, the cyberstalking statute does not require any overt action such as following the victim or placing the victim under surveillance in addition to a threat. As a result, defendant maintains that the cyberstalking statute criminalizes speech alone and is thus unconstitutionally overbroad.\n\nHowever, defendant misunderstands our supreme court's analysis in Bailey. In Bailey, our supreme court did not hold that a physical act in addition to a threat was a prerequisite to survive an overbreadth challenge. Rather, the court explained:\n\n\"The element of a threat in the stalking statute is an integral part of the offense. The offense cannot be committed without the initiation of the threat because the following and surveillance requirements can only be met after a threat has been made. We therefore conclude that the element of speech in the stalking statute is not constitutionally protected. Moreover, because the statute only encompasses activities performed without lawful authority, we find that it does not implicate any other constitutionally protected activity.\" Bailey, 167 Ill.2d at 227-28, 212 Ill. Dec. 608, 657 N.E.2d 953.\nIn this case, the element of a threat is also an integral part of the offense of cyberstalking. Therefore, the element of speech in the cyberstalking statute, the threat, does not fall within the protections of the first amendment. In addition, our supreme court noted that the legislature's intent in enacting statutes, such as the stalking statute, was \"to prevent violent attacks by allowing the police to act before the victim was actually injured and to prevent the terror produced by harassing actions.\" Bailey, 167 Ill.2d at 224, 212 Ill. Dec. 608, 657 N.E.2d 953. Our supreme court explained, \"By construing the statutes to proscribe only conduct performed `without lawful authority,' the possibility that the statutes reach innocent conduct is also avoided. Bailey, 167 Ill.2d at 224-25,  212 Ill. Dec. 608, 657 N.E.2d 953.\n\nFurther, defendant's hypothetical scenarios, i.e. a threatening e-mail sent as a practical joke or common hyperbole, are not reasonable demonstrations of constitutionally protected conduct punishable by the statute. The punishable behavior is narrowed by the elements of the cyberstalking statute, such that the defendant must \"knowingly and without lawful justification\" specifically intend to \"haras[s]\" the victim by transmitting the threat. 720 ILCS 5/12-7.5 (West 2008). Accordingly, no first amendment concerns are at issue here and the statute is not void for overbreadth.\n\nDefendant, nonetheless, argues that the cyberstalking statute as applied to this case violated his right to free speech because he did not intend his statements *1242 to be \"true threats,\" which are excluded from first amendment protection. The State correctly notes that defendant's \"as applied\" argument does not present a viable facial challenge that would result in the wholesale striking of the cyberstalking statute as unconstitutional. Rather, if defendant were to establish that his statements did not constitute true \"threats\" within the meaning of the statute, the appropriate remedy would be to vacate his sentence and conviction for cyberstalking. See Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 708, 89 S. Ct. 1399, 1401, 22 L. Ed. 2d 664, 667 (1969) (statute prohibiting threats against President of the United States was constitutional on its face; however, the defendant's political hyperbole did not fit within the statutory term \"true threat\" and the defendant was to be acquitted).\n\nDefendant relies on Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 359-60, 123 S. Ct. 1536, 1548, 155 L. Ed. 2d 535, 552 (2003), in support of his argument that a subjective approach should be applied to determine whether his statements amounted to \"true threats.\"\n\nIn Black, the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a Virginia statute making it a criminal offense to burn a cross with intent to intimidate. The Court invalidated the statute on first amendment grounds, but the justices were divided on the rationale. Black, 538 U.S. at 366-67, 123 S.Ct. at 1551-52, 155 L.Ed.2d at 556-57. For our purposes, here, the plurality noted that the first amendment does not preclude restrictions on certain categories of speech having little or no social value, and threats are one such category. The plurality offered a new definition of true threats:\n\n\"`True threats' encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals. [Citations.] The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a prohibition on true threats `protects individuals from the fear of violence' and `from the disruption that fear engenders,' in addition to protecting people `from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.' [Citation.] Intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.\" Black, 538 U.S. at 359-60, 123 S.Ct. at 1548, 155 L.Ed.2d at 551-52.\nDefendant notes that some federal courts have held that a \"statement qualifies as a true threat only if the speaker subjectively intended it as a threat.\" United States v. Parr, 545 F.3d 491, 499 (7th Cir.2008), citing United States v. Magleby, 420 F.3d 1136 (10th Cir.2005), United States v. Cassel, 408 F.3d 622, 631 (9th Cir.2005). However, not all courts have agreed that Black changed the test for true threats. See, e.g., Porter v. Ascension Parish School Board, 393 F.3d 608, 616 (5th Cir. 2004) (interpreting Black to require only that the speaker knowingly made the statement, not subjectively intended it as a threat).\n\nThis court has previously found that the term \"threat\" implies that the threatening expression has \"`a reasonable tendency to create apprehension that its originator will act according to its tenor.'\" People v. Zamudio, 293 Ill.App.3d 976, 983, 228 Ill. Dec. 382, 689 N.E.2d 254 (1997), quoting, People v. Maldonado, 247 Ill.App.3d 149, 153-54, 187 Ill. Dec. 28, 617 N.E.2d 236 *1243 (1993). However, this court need not resolve whether the Supreme Court in Black intended to add a subjective intent requirement to the test for true threats in order to address the constitutionality of the cyberstalking statute. As previously discussed, the statute was intended to only punish conduct performed \"knowingly and without lawful justification.\" 720 ILCS 5/12-7.5 (West 2008). The State must prove that defendant engaged in such conduct or speech that was not constitutionally protected. As discussed later in addressing defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, defendant placed his subjective intent at issue by arguing that his statements were merely \"spiritual\" in nature rather than threats. The trial court, as trier of fact, rejected defendant's argument and determined that his statements were clear threats directed at the victim. Moreover, while defendant asserts that he did not intend to actually harm the victim, the Supreme Court explained in Black, defendant \"need not actually intend to carry out the threat.\" Black, 538 U.S. at 359-60, 123 S.Ct. at 1548, 155 L.Ed.2d at 551-52. Defendant's statements in this case clearly fit within the \"true threat\" requirement of the cyberstalking statute.\n\nB. Vagueness\n\nDefendant additionally argues that the cyberstalking statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face. \"[A] statute is void for vagueness if it reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\" City of Chicago v. Pooh Bah Enterprises, Inc., 224 Ill. 2d 390, 442, 309 Ill. Dec. 770,  865 N.E.2d 133 (2006). To prevail on a vagueness challenge, the challenger must demonstrate that: (1) a person of ordinary intelligence would not have a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct the statute prohibits; or (2) the statute authorizes or encourages arbitrary enforcement. Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732, 120 S. Ct. 2480, 2498, 147 L. Ed. 2d 597, 621 (2000).\n\nWe find that defendant failed to demonstrate that the cyberstalking statute is vague. Because the analyses for facial overbreadth and vagueness challenges are akin and we previously determined in his overbreadth challenge that defendant failed to demonstrate that the cyberstalking statute punished a substantial amount of protected speech, defendant also cannot present a successful vagueness argument. See People v. Butler, 375 Ill.App.3d 269, 273,  313 Ill. Dec. 856, 873 N.E.2d 480 (2007) (holding the Illinois witness harassment statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague on its face).\n\nNevertheless, we also find that defendant cannot demonstrate that the cyberstalking statute fails to provide citizens with adequate notice or leads to arbitrary enforcement. Specifically, defendant asserts that citizens are not apprised of the prohibited conduct and arbitrary enforcement results where the legislature did not precisely define a standard by which to judge \"emotional distress\" or \"mental anguish\" caused by a statement that \"alarms, torments, or terrorizes\" the victim. See 720 ILCS 5/12-7.5 (West 2008). Defendant relies on Coates v. City of Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611, 91 S. Ct. 1686, 29 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1971), in support of his argument. However, the present case is distinguishable.\n\nIn Coates, the United States Supreme Court held that a statute criminalizing situations where three or more people annoyed any police officer or passerby while standing on a sidewalk or street corner was unconstitutionally vague because the *1244 proscribed conduct, annoying an officer or passerby, without more amounted to \"no standard of conduct * * * specified at all.\" Coates, 402 U.S. at 614, 91 S.Ct. at 1688, 29 L.Ed.2d at 217. In contrast, the scope of punishable conduct under the instant statute is limited by the individual's specified intent to \"haras[s]\" by communicating a \"threat\" so as to \"engage in a knowing and willful course of conduct\" directed at the victim that \"alarms, torments, or terrorizes\" the victim. See 720 ILCS 5/12-7.5 (West 2008). While the legislature framed the prohibited result in general terms of causing alarm, torment or terror, it is well settled that \"`\"[i]mpossible standards of specificity * * * are not required.\"'\" Butler, 375 Ill.App.3d at 274, 313 Ill. Dec. 856, 873 N.E.2d 480, quoting People v. Parkins, 77 Ill. 2d 253, 256,  32 Ill. Dec. 909, 396 N.E.2d 22 (1979), quoting People v. Schwartz, 64 Ill. 2d 275, 280, 1 Ill. Dec. 8, 356 N.E.2d 8 (1976). We determine that application of the ordinary meaning of the statutory language and recognition of the evil the statute intends to prevent, i.e., to prevent violent attacks by allowing the police to act before the victim is actually injured and to prevent the terror produced by harassing actions (see Bailey, 167 Ill.2d at 224,  212 Ill. Dec. 608, 657 N.E.2d 953), provides adequate notice and prevents arbitrary enforcement. See Butler, 375 Ill.App.3d at 274,  313 Ill. Dec. 856, 873 N.E.2d 480. Accordingly, we conclude that the cyberstalking statute is not unconstitutionally vague on its face.\n\nC. One-Act, One-Crime Rule\n\nDefendant next argues that this court should vacate his conviction for harassment through electronic communication where that conviction was based on the same act used to support his conviction for cyberstalking, in violation of the one-act, one-crime rule announced in People v. King, 66 Ill. 2d 551,  6 Ill. Dec. 891, 363 N.E.2d 838 (1977).\n\nIn King, the supreme court stated:\n\n\"Prejudice results to the defendant only in those instances where more than one offense is carved from the same physical act. Prejudice, with regard to multiple acts, exists only when the defendant is convicted of more than one offense, some of which are, by definition, lesser included offenses. Multiple convictions and concurrent sentences should be permitted in all other cases where a defendant has committed several acts, despite the interrelationship of those acts. `Act,' when used in this sense, is intended to mean any overt or outward manifestation which will support a different offense. We hold, therefore, that when more than one offense arises from a series of incidental or closely related acts and the offenses are not, by definition, lesser included offenses, convictions with concurrent sentences can be entered.\" King, 66 Ill.2d at 566,  6 Ill. Dec. 891, 363 N.E.2d 838.\nThe King case was reaffirmed and clarified by our supreme court in People v. Rodriguez, 169 Ill. 2d 183, 214 Ill. Dec. 451, 661 N.E.2d 305 (1996). In Rodriguez, the court noted that, under King, a court first must determine whether a defendant's conduct consists of one act or several acts. Multiple convictions are improper if they are based on precisely the same physical act. If the defendant's conduct is based on more than one physical act, a court must then determine whether any of the offenses are lesser-included offenses. If they are, then multiple convictions are improper. Rodriguez, 169 Ill.2d at 186,  214 Ill. Dec. 451, 661 N.E.2d 305. The court held that convictions for both aggravated *1245 criminal sexual assault and home invasion were proper where the defendant committed multiple acts, despite the interrelationship of those acts. Rodriguez, 169 Ill.2d at 189, 214 Ill. Dec. 451,  661 N.E.2d 305.\n\nIn People v. Artis, 232 Ill. 2d 156, 168, 327 Ill. Dec. 556, 902 N.E.2d 677 (2009), our supreme court held that it would not abandon the one-act, one-crime rule announced in King. In so doing, the court noted that it has found a one-act, one-crime violation to qualify for review under the second prong of the plain-error rule. Artis, 232 Ill.2d at 165-66, 327 Ill. Dec. 556, 902 N.E.2d 677. The court explained:\n\n\"Under that portion of the rule, a court may disregard forfeiture where a clear or obvious error occurs and that error is so serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant's trial and challenged the integrity of the judicial process. [Citation.] The second prong of the plain-error rule is `invoked only in those exceptional circumstances where, despite the absence of objection, application of the rule is necessary to preserve the integrity and reputation of the judicial process.'\" Artis, 232 Ill.2d at 165-66, 327 Ill. Dec. 556, 902 N.E.2d 677, quoting People v. Harvey, 211 Ill. 2d 368, 387,  286 Ill. Dec. 124, 813 N.E.2d 181 (2004).\nRecently, in People v. Nunez, 236 Ill. 2d 488, 338 Ill. Dec. 877, 925 N.E.2d 1083 (2010), our supreme court, citing Artis, held that \"forfeited one-act, one-crime arguments are properly reviewed under the second prong of the plain-error rule because they implicate the integrity of the judicial process.\"\n\nAccordingly, while defendant in this case forfeited his one-act, one-crime argument for review by failing to object or include the issue in a posttrial motion, we will consider defendant's argument under the plain-error rule.\n\nDefendant was charged and convicted of cyberstalking (720 ILCS 5/12-7.5(a)(1) (West 2008)), a Class 3 offense, based on two e-mails sent to the victim on March 13, 2007, containing the threats \"that he will kill himself and take her with him\" and \"that the victim killed his heart and he will get even.\" Defendant was also charged and convicted of harassment through electronic communication (720 ILCS 135/1-2(a)(4) (West 2008)), a Class 4 offense, based on the e-mail sent to the victim containing the threat \"that he will kill himself and take her with him.\" There is no separate act in this case. In one instance the e-mail threatening to \"kill himself and take [the victim] with him\" is combined with a second e-mail to constitute cyberstalking, and in the other it is the same e-mail threatening to \"kill himself and take [the victim] with him\" to create a separate offense of harassment through electronic communication. We hold that the one-act, one-crime rule applies to these convictions. Therefore, the separate conviction for harassment through electronic communication is reversed and the sentence vacated.\n\nD. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\nDefendant also argues that the State failed to prove him guilty of cyberstalking and stalking beyond a reasonable doubt.[2]\n\nWhen reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, this court must determine *1246 \"`\"whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Emphasis in original.)' [Citations.]\" People v. Cardamone, 232 Ill. 2d 504, 511, 328 Ill. Dec. 917, 905 N.E.2d 806 (2009). It is not this court's function to retry the defendant or substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact. People v. Evans, 209 Ill. 2d 194, 211, 283 Ill. Dec. 651, 808 N.E.2d 939 (2004). Rather, the trier of fact assesses the credibility of the witnesses, determines the appropriate weight of the testimony and resolves conflicts or inconsistencies in the evidence. Evans, 209 Ill.2d at 211, 283 Ill. Dec. 651, 808 N.E.2d 939. In order to overturn the trial court's judgment, the evidence must be so improbable or unsatisfactory as to raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt. People v. Graham, 392 Ill.App.3d 1001, 1009, 331 Ill. Dec. 507,  910 N.E.2d 1263 (2009).\n\nTo be convicted of cyberstalking, the State must prove that the defendant, on at least two separate occasions, harassed the victim through the use of electronic communication by transmitting \"a threat of immediate or future bodily harm.\" The cyberstalking statute defines harassment as a \"knowing and willful course of conduct\" that \"alarms, torments, or terrorizes\" the victim. 720 ILCS 5/12-7.5 (West 2008). Defendant contends that the State failed to prove that defendant's statements included two instances of threats of either future or immediate bodily harm and that the victim was alarmed, tormented, or terrorized where she did not immediately call police after receiving the e-mails from defendant.\n\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we find that the State satisfied its burden. The evidence at trial established that on March 13, 2007 at 1:57 a.m., defendant sent the victim an e-mail in which, inter alia, defendant stated \"I will commit suicide, my life will vanish or I will do suicide and I will take you with me.\" Defendant sent the victim a second e-mail at 3:31 a.m., stating, \"You killed my heart, I will get even,\" \"I am so desperate I do not mind dying as of now,\" \"Try me.\" The e-mail ended with the word \"Killer.\" The State also presented evidence that defendant left the victim several voice mail phone messages in which defendant, inter alia, directed the victim to check her e-mail and stated, \"I'm dead. I'm a dead person without you and [your son]. So, I will take you with me. * * * I need you with me * * * in heaven, okay?\" The victim also testified that defendant attempted to break into her apartment on January 27, 2007. The victim's neighbors testified that on the evening of February 19, 2007, they observed defendant in the hallway of the victim's apartment building and saw defendant caressing the door. The victim's neighbors testified that they asked defendant to leave the building two separate times and called police. The victim testified on that date, February 19, 2007, the air was let out of her car's tires and she received voice mail phone messages from the defendant acknowledging that he flattened her tires. The victim further testified that defendant's voice mail messages, e-mails, and the January 27, 2007 attempted break-in made her feel scared and threatened. While defendant argues that his e-mails referred to threatening to report the victim for insurance fraud which did not amount to physical harm, defendant's e-mails also contained statements indicating that he would cause the victim bodily harm. In this context, the trial court assessed *1247 the credibility of the witnesses and rejected defendant's testimony that his statements were merely spiritual in nature. We find that the evidence was not so improbable or unsatisfactory as to raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt of cyberstalking. Graham, 392 Ill. App.3d at 1009,  331 Ill. Dec. 507, 910 N.E.2d 1263 (2009).\n\nDefendant also contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for stalking where the State failed to prove that defendant on two separate occasions placed the victim \"under surveillance.\"\n\nThe stalking statute in effect at the time, provided as follows:\n\n\"(a) A person commits stalking when he or she, knowingly and without lawful justification, on at least 2 separate occasions follows another person or places the person under surveillance or any combination thereof and:\n(1) at any time transmits a threat to that person of immediate or future bodily harm, sexual assault, confinement or restraint; or\n(2) places that person in reasonable apprehension of immediate of future bodily harm, sexual assault, confinement or restraint.\" 720 ILCS 5/12-7.3(a)(1),(a)(2) (West 2008).\nThe statute also specifies that one \"places a person under surveillance\" by \"remaining present outside the person's school, place of employment, vehicle, other place occupied by the person, or residence other than the residence of the defendant.\" 720 ILCS 5/12-7.3(d) (West 2008).\n\nDefendant argues that his actions on January 27, 2007, and February 19, 2007, did not constitute placing Stern \"under surveillance\" because he did not \"remain present\" outside her residence. Defendant maintains that he merely went to Stern's residence, where he formerly resided, and that there was no evidence that the victim was inside of her residence on February 19, 2007.\n\nThis court considered a similar argument in People v. Daniel, 283 Ill.App.3d 1003, 219 Ill. Dec. 183, 670 N.E.2d 861 (1996). In Daniel, the defendant challenged his aggravated stalking conviction, contending that he did not remain present outside the victim's place of employment. Daniel, 283 Ill.App.3d at 1005-06, 219 Ill. Dec. 183, 670 N.E.2d 861. The evidence revealed that the defendant entered the victim's workplace, threatened her, threatened to damage her vehicle, and ranted for approximately 15 minutes. After he left the building where the victim worked, the defendant crossed the street, walked to the rear of the victim's car, hit the window, and then departed. Daniel, 283 Ill.App.3d at 1004, 219 Ill. Dec. 183, 670 N.E.2d 861. This court found two distinct bases to uphold the defendant's conviction based on the defendant's actions both inside and outside the victim's place of employment. Daniel, 283 Ill.App.3d at 1006, 219 Ill. Dec. 183, 670 N.E.2d 861. This court held that the defendant violated the stalking statute by \"`remaining outside' the [victim's place of employment]\u2014even for a brief period\u2014 because of the nature of his actions, actions that the stalking statute was designed to prohibit and that established that he was no mere passerby.\" Daniel, 283 Ill.App.3d at 1006 n. 1, 219 Ill. Dec. 183, 670 N.E.2d 861. This court explained:\n\n\"We discern no statutory intent to set a minimum amount of time a defendant must remain in the vicinity of his victim's building before coming within the *1248 ambit of the stalking statute. Thus, although `remain' has a temporal connotation, there is no basis for concluding that a defendant must stop, stay, or wait for a set period of time before his behavior is deemed to be surveillance under the stalking statute.\" Daniel, 283 Ill.App.3d at 1008, 219 Ill. Dec. 183,  670 N.E.2d 861.\nThis court further stated, \"Although this is not the paradigmatic case where a stalker lies in wait for his victim, there is no basis for concluding that the legislature meant to exempt this sort of conduct from the stalking statute.\" Daniel, 283 Ill.App.3d at 1009, 219 Ill. Dec. 183, 670 N.E.2d 861.\n\nThe holding in Daniel was followed and further explained by this court in People v. Curtis, 354 Ill.App.3d 312, 290 Ill. Dec. 49, 820 N.E.2d 1116 (2004). In Curtis, this court found that the evidence was sufficient to show that the defendant placed the victim \"under surveillance,\" as required for aggravated stalking. The defendant had called the victim and warned her that when he returned to jail it would be for something more serious, went to the victim's house, called and threatened to kill the victim if she did not let him see their child. The defendant told the victim that he would return her leather jackets that he stole from her house if she let him see their child and dictated a time and place to meet. At the meeting, the defendant waved at the victim, walked toward her car and motioned for her to come to him, but defendant did not have the leather jackets. Curtis, 354 Ill.App.3d at 319-20, 290 Ill. Dec. 49,  820 N.E.2d 1116. This court followed the holding in Daniel that \"there was no minimum period of time that defendant was required to remain present outside [the victim's] car or that he was required to stop, stay or wait for a set period of time outside the car in order for his actions to constitute surveillance.\" Curtis, 354 Ill.App.3d at 318, 290 Ill. Dec. 49, 820 N.E.2d 1116. This court again explained that the stalking statute encompasses more than incidents in which a stalker laid in wait for his victim. This court explained, \"The legislature enacted this statute to prevent violent attacks on victims by prohibiting the conduct that precedes them and by allowing the police to act before the victim is actually injured.\" Curtis, 354 Ill.App.3d at 319, 290 Ill. Dec. 49,  820 N.E.2d 1116.\n\nWe agree with Daniel and Curtis and conclude that there was no minimum period of time that defendant was required to remain present outside the victim's apartment on January 27, 2007, or February 19, 2007. Additionally, defendant's conduct was not the sort of innocent behavior of a mere visitor as he suggests. Rather, the evidence showed that on January 27, 2007, defendant attempted to break into the victim's apartment through her back door and yelled obscenities at her. On February 19, 2007, the victim's neighbors observed defendant on two separate occasions in the hallway outside of the victim's apartment. The victim's neighbors testified that defendant caressed the victim's door and would not leave until they told him they were calling the police. As to defendant's argument that the State failed to prove that the victim was inside her residence on February 19, 2007, we find this to be immaterial. Section 12-7.3(d) provides that one \"places a person under surveillance\" by \"remaining present outside the person's school, place of employment, vehicle, other place occupied by the person, or residence other than the residence of the defendant.\" (Emphasis added.) 720 ILCS 5/12-7.3(d) (West 2008). A plain reading of the phrase \"occupied by the person\" demonstrates that it applies *1249 only to the words preceding it\u2014\"other place.\" It is not applicable to the victim's school, place of employment, vehicle or residence. Therefore, we will not depart from the plain language of the statute by reading into it exceptions, limitations, or conditions that conflict with the expressed intent. See People v. Cardamone, 232 Ill. 2d 504, 516, 328 Ill. Dec. 917, 905 N.E.2d 806 (2009).\n\nDefendant further argues that the State failed to prove that defendant placed the victim in \"reasonable apprehension of immediate or future bodily harm, * * *, confinement, or restraint\" pursuant to section 12-7.3(a)(2) of the stalking statute (720 ILCS 5/12-7.3(a)(2) (West 2008)). However, the record shows that defendant was charged with stalking pursuant to section 12-7.3(a)(1) of the statute, which requires the State to show that the defendant \"at any time transmit[ted] a threat of immediate or future bodily harm.\" 720 ILCS 5/12-7.3(a)(1) (West 2008). The evidence at trial showed that defendant left the victim several voice mail phone messages threatening to kill her. Accordingly, defendant's argument is without merit.\n\nE. Krankel Inquiry\n\nDefendant next contends that the circuit court failed to conduct any inquiry into his pro se allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, as required by People v. Krankel, 102 Ill. 2d 181, 80 Ill. Dec. 62, 464 N.E.2d 1045 (1984). Defendant requests that the matter be remanded to the circuit court for an inquiry into defendant's ineffective assistance claims.\n\nIn Krankel, the defendant's trial counsel did not contact an alibi witness or present an affirmative alibi defense at trial. The defendant raised a pro se posttrial challenge to his attorney's competence at trial. Our supreme court held that the trial court should have appointed alternative counsel to represent the defendant at the posttrial hearing regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The court remanded the matter for a new hearing on the defendant's motion with newly appointed counsel. Krankel, 102 Ill.2d at 187-89, 80 Ill. Dec. 62, 464 N.E.2d 1045.\n\nIn People v. Moore, 207 Ill. 2d 68, 278 Ill. Dec. 36, 797 N.E.2d 631 (2003), our supreme court further explained the procedures that trial courts should use to resolve pro se claims of ineffectiveness of counsel. The trial court is not required to automatically appoint new counsel in every case; rather, the trial court should evaluate the factual basis of the defendant's claim. Moore, 207 Ill.2d at 77-78, 278 Ill. Dec. 36, 797 N.E.2d 631. The operative concern for the reviewing court is whether the trial court conducted an adequate inquiry into the defendant's pro se allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Moore, 207 Ill.2d at 78, 278 Ill. Dec. 36, 797 N.E.2d 631. This inquiry can be accomplished in several ways. The trial court could simply ask the trial counsel about the circumstances surrounding the claim or ask defendant questions about his claim. Moore, 207 Ill.2d at 78, 278 Ill. Dec. 36,  797 N.E.2d 631. Alternatively, the trial court can base its determination on its personal knowledge of defense counsel's performance at trial or on the facial insufficiency of defendant's allegations. Moore, 207 Ill.2d at 79, 278 Ill. Dec. 36, 797 N.E.2d 631. If the trial court determines that the claim lacks merit or pertains only to matters of trial strategy, then the court need not appoint new counsel and may deny the pro se motion. Moore, 207 Ill.2d at 78,  278 Ill. Dec. 36, 797 N.E.2d 631. However, if the allegations show possible neglect of the *1250 case, new counsel should be appointed. Moore, 207 Ill.2d at 78, 278 Ill. Dec. 36, 797 N.E.2d 631.\n\nDefendant first argues that the circuit court should have conducted an inquiry into defendant's pretrial claims, where \"on almost every pretrial date, [defendant] sought to speak with the trial court or otherwise objected.\" The State responds that Krankel is inapplicable to pretrial claims and the trial court satisfied any required inquiry into defendant's pro se claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\n\nThe record shows that defendant made repeated interruptions during court proceedings. For example, on the second pretrial date, September 27, 2007, the circuit court continued the matter and defendant stated, \"Judge, I want pro se.\" On October 31, 2007, defendant interrupted proceedings and stated that his trial attorney was \"defective\" in her failure to advise him of the \"penalties in case of rejecting\" an offer. The circuit court explained:\n\n\"Well, you understand, sir, it's up to the Judge to determine what the appropriate sentence is. Even if your attorney reaches an agreement with the State, I would still have to go along with that. I know nothing about your case, I know nothing about your background. Whether of not I would even go along with an agreement, that's speculation.\"\nDefendant responded, \"If I did not reject it, I would have been free on September 11 at the latest.\" The court then explained, \"What if I didn't go along with it? I could have said no.\" Even if the trial court was required to inquire into defendant's pretrial claims under Krankel, the record shows that the court considered defendant's allegation and determined that it was speculative and, therefore insufficient. The trial court was permitted to base its determination on the facial insufficiency of defendant's allegations. Moore, 207 Ill.2d at 79, 278 Ill. Dec. 36, 797 N.E.2d 631.\n\nDefendant filed a pro se motion to dismiss his indictment alleging a speedy trial violation and that trial counsel \"ignored [his] discovery\" and was an \"accessory\" to the fact that \"[t]he whole case is false and intend[ed] to prevent defendant [from] hand[ing] over complain[ing] witness to federal prosecution for forging [her] insurance claim.\" We note that defendant testified at trial regarding this \"defense.\"\n\nDefendant also filed a pro se motion for new trial alleging, inter alia, that trial counsel \"misl[ed][him] about discovery and test[imony],\" was \"ineffective [in] examining witnesses, refusing to place * * * questions she was given,\" \"stipulated to improper evidences [sic] presented\" and \"counsel had a conflict of interest.\" The only stipulations entered into in the instant case were in regards to the identity of the e-mail accounts from which the e-mails at issue were sent and received, and the translation of the content of the e-mails which were partially in Serbian. Defendant himself testified as to the contents of the e-mails, acknowledging that he had sent them to the victim and that the translation was correct.\n\nDuring defendant's sentencing hearing, the circuit court stated, \"I've read your motion for a new trial.\" Also, during the sentencing hearing defendant explained his argument that the State had delayed his trial and trial counsel was ineffective in representing him with respect to a proposed plea agreement. Defendant stated:\n\n\"And the second thing is that plea negotiations * * * the State should never have engaged in pulling my mind such that they did in November.\n*1251 I had a visit in the jail offer [sic] that they would leave for November the 29th and then denied. And it's obvious confirmation of playing games in regards to stalling case.\"\nDefendant's trial counsel addressed defendant's argument and stated:\n\n\"When [defendant] said that he had been offered misdemeanor probation, I would say that that is correct.\nHe was offered a misdemeanor back in, I believe it was April. And then later on, in November, it was apparently a misunderstanding or a miscommunication between me and [the prosecutor]. But, I was led to at least interpret the States's offer as one of misdemeanor.\nSo, I went to the jail and talked to [defendant] about a misdemeanor and he was prepared to plead to that. And that is what he's referring to. And he was understandably upset when that possibility was taken away.\"\nThe record therefore shows that trial counsel addressed defendant's claims. Any inquiry required by the trial court into defendant's pro se claims was satisfied by trial counsel explaining the circumstances surrounding the claim. See Moore, 207 Ill.2d at 78, 278 Ill. Dec. 36, 797 N.E.2d 631.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the above reasons, we vacate defendant's conviction and sentence for harassment through electronic communication as violative of the one-act, one-crime rule and affirm the judgment of the circuit court with respect to defendant's convictions and sentences for cyberstalking and stalking.\n\nVacated in part and affirmed in part.\n\nSTEELE and COLEMAN, JJ., concur.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] The parties stipulated that Jeff Stanford, a senior supervisor for legal services at Yahoo, Inc., would testify that the e-mails in question were sent from \"TWRControl@yahoo.com\" to \"LuckyCharms_x_6@yahoo.com.\" Stern testified that these were defendant and her e-mail addresses, respectively.\n\n[2] Because we vacate defendant's conviction and sentence for harassment through electronic communication as violative of the one-act, one-crime rule, we need not consider defendant's sufficiency of the evidence argument with respect to that offense.", "annotations": [{"start": 0,

A jury sitting before the Simpson County Circuit Court found Rubin Renfrow guilty of one count of possession of child pornography. The circuit court sentenced Renfrow to fifteen years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC). Aggrieved, Renfrow appeals. Renfrow claims the circuit court erred when it: (1) denied his motions to suppress the evidence that was obtained from his computer, (2) denied his motion to suppress the evidence related to his interview at the Simpson County Sheriff's Department, (3) denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis that Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-5-33(5) (Supp.2008) is impermissibly vague, (4) denied his motion for a continuance intended to give his attorney more time to review a forensic duplicate of his hard drive and his original hard drive, (5) denied his motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), and (6) denied his motion for a new trial. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b6 2. The catalyst that led to Renfrow's conviction occurred in March 2006, when a child related to Renfrow spoke to an elementary school counselor. It is unclear what the child said to the school counselor, but whatever the child said, the school counselor was concerned that the child had been exposed to inappropriate matters of a sexual nature. The school counselor relayed his concerns to the child's father and Kim Fulgram with the Rankin County Department of Human Services. Fulgram contacted Brian Ervin, a counselor with the Rankin County Child Advocacy Center. On March 8, 2006, Ervin interviewed the child who spoke to the school counselor. Ervin also interviewed the child's sibling. *622 The children, then ages four and six years old, indicated that Renfrow showed them pictures that he had on his computer.[1] To paraphrase the children, Renfrow showed them pictures of naked adults and children. The inference was that Renfrow had showed the children pictures of adult and child pornography. The children also allegedly indicated that Renfrow had touched them inappropriately.[2]\n\n\u00b6 3. Because the events described by the children were to have taken place in Simpson County, Fulgram contacted the Simpson County Sheriff's Department. On March 16, 2006, the children's father met with Investigator Bernard Gunter of the Simpson County Sheriff's Department. Investigator Gunter also watched the videotape of Erwin's interviews of the children. On March 21, 2006, Investigator Gunter applied for and obtained warrants to arrest Renfrow and to search Renfrow's home and seize his computer. That same day, Investigator Gunter executed the warrants. Investigator Gunter went to Renfrow's home in Simpson County, arrested Renfrow, and seized Renfrow's computer. Investigator Gunter delivered Renfrow's computer to the Mississippi Attorney General's Cyber Crime Unit (the Cyber Crime Center), where forensic investigators Sherita Sullivan and Keith Leavitt examined Renfrow's computer. Their examinations will be discussed in greater detail below. Succinctly stated, the investigation of Renfrow's computer involved creating a forensic duplicate of Renfrow's hard drive and then examining the forensic duplicate.\n\n\u00b6 4. Meanwhile, Renfrow had been arrested and released from custody. However, on March 16, 2007, Renfrow reported to the Simpson County Sheriff's Department after Investigator Gunter had placed a card on the door of Renfrow's home and requested that Renfrow report to the Simpson County Sheriff's Department. Investigator Gunter later explained that he intended to serve Renfrow with a capias. However, when Renfrow reported, he informed Investigator Gunter that he would waive his rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present and would allow Investigator Gunter to interview him. Renfrow executed a document waiving his rights and allowed Investigator Gunter to interview him while Sheriff Kenneth Lewis was present. During that interview, Renfrow stated that he knew he had pictures depicting child pornography on his computer. However, he also stated that he obtained the pictures inadvertently. To summarize Renfrow's version of events, he received unsolicited e-mails that included the pictures depicting child pornography, he did not know who sent him the pictures, and he tried to delete the pictures.\n\n\u00b6 5. Investigator Gunter attempted to create a videotaped recording of Renfrow's interview. However, after the interview had ended, Investigator Gunter discovered that he had failed to activate a switch that would have created an audio recording of the interview. In other words, Investigator Gunter only had a video recording of the interview. There was no audio recording. *623 Investigator Gunter then wrote a summary of Renfrow's interview. Sheriff Lewis signed Investigator Gunter's summary and indicated that he shared Investigator Gunter's recollection of Renfrow's interview.\n\n\u00b6 6. On October 1, 2007, the Simpson County Grand Jury returned an indictment against Renfrow, charging him with one count of touching a child inappropriately in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-5-23(1) (Rev.2006). The grand jury also charged Renfrow with one count of willful possession of child pornography. Renfrow waived arraignment and pled not guilty.\n\n\u00b6 7. Renfrow filed numerous pretrial motions. For our purposes, only a few of those motions are noteworthy. On February 13, 2008, Renfrow filed a motion to review the State's evidence. That same day, Renfrow filed a relatively generic motion to suppress practically any evidence the State obtained from any source. On February 28, 2008, Renfrow filed a motion for a continuance. Renfrow requested a continuance so he could review the discovery tendered by the State. Renfrow also requested that he and his computer expert be allowed access to the original hard drive that was removed from his computer. On March 5, 2008, Renfrow filed an amended motion to suppress the State's evidence. The majority of Renfrow's amended motion to suppress was identical to his original motion to suppress. However, Renfrow added a claim that \"[t]he State has wholly failed to protect and secure the [evidence obtained from Renfrow's computer], and it has been contaminated and subjected to potential virus infection.\"\n\n\u00b6 8. On March 7, 2008, the circuit court conducted a hearing on Renfrow's first series of pretrial motions. The events that transpired during the hearing on those motions will be discussed in greater detail as necessary in the analysis of Renfrow's issues. Suffice it to say that the circuit court granted Renfrow's motion for a continuance so Renfrow's computer expert could review a copy of Renfrow's hard drive. The circuit court rescheduled Renfrow's trial date and set Renfrow's trial for March 27, 2008. However, the circuit court also denied Renfrow's motions to suppress the evidence.\n\n\u00b6 9. During the March 7, 2008, hearing, Renfrow moved to dismiss the indictment. Renfrow argued that section 97-5-33(5) is impermissibly vague because it does not include a mens rea component. The State pointed out that, while there is no mens rea component listed in that statutory provision, the language in the indictment required the State to prove that Renfrow willfully possessed child pornography. The circuit court denied Renfrow's motion to dismiss the indictment and noted that because the indictment contained the allegation that Renfrow willfully possessed child pornography, the State would be obligated to prove that portion of the allegation beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the circuit court rescheduled Renfrow's trial date.\n\n\u00b6 10. On March 14, 2008, the State filed a document titled \"entry of nolle prosequi\" and moved that the circuit court dismiss the charge that Renfrow inappropriately touched the children. The circuit court executed the consent portion of that document on the same day. On March 19, 2008, Renfrow filed three new pretrial motions. Two of those motions are pertinent to the issues on appeal. The first of those pertinent motions was Renfrow's second motion for a continuance. Renfrow's March 19, 2008, motion for a continuance was based on the fact that, although the State provided his expert with access to an exact copy of the hard drive, the State had not given his expert access to the original *624 hard drive. Additionally, Renfrow filed a renewed motion to suppress the evidence. Renfrow claimed the circuit court should suppress the evidence that Investigator Gunter obtained when he executed the search warrant. The most significant evidence that Investigator Gunter seized was Renfrow's computer and all of the evidence that was obtained from his computer. Renfrow argued that it was appropriate to suppress that evidence because the events that led to the acquisition of the search warrant occurred nine or ten months before Investigator Gunter sought to obtain the search warrant.\n\n\u00b6 11. On March 20, 2008, the circuit court conducted another series of hearings on Renfrow's motions. After some discussion, it was resolved that the State would allow Renfrow's expert to make her own copy of Renfrow's original hard drive, subject to the conditions that Renfrow's expert make her copy at the Cyber Crime Center under the supervision of employees of the Cyber Crime Center, who would ensure that Renfrow's expert maintained the evidentiary integrity of Renfrow's original hard drive. However, the circuit court did not grant Renfrow's request for a continuance.\n\n\u00b6 12. As for Renfrow's renewed motion to suppress the evidence obtained by the search warrant, the circuit court found that, although the children indicated that the alleged inappropriate touching occurred in April or May 2005, the children did not report the allegation until late February or early March 2006. The circuit court also found that Investigator Gunter acted on the allegations as soon as he found out about them. Accordingly, the circuit court denied Renfrow's renewed motion to suppress. There were no further delays, and Renfrow went to trial as scheduled.\n\n\u00b6 13. The events that transpired at Renfrow's trial will be discussed as necessary in the analysis portion of this opinion. As previously mentioned, the jury found Renfrow guilty of possession of child pornography. Following Renfrow's unsuccessful post-trial motions for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, alternatively, a new trial, the circuit court sentenced Renfrow to fifteen years in the custody of the MDOC. Aggrieved, Renfrow appeals. We have restructured the issues and Renfrow's arguments to provide greater clarity, as Renfrow's claims require significantly more separate discussions than the six issues he lists.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nI. RENFROW'S MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT\n\n\u00b6 14. Count II of the indictment charged Renfrow with violating section 97-5-33(5) of the Mississippi Code, which states that \"[n]o person shall, by any means including computer, possess any photograph, drawing, sketch, film, video tape or other visual depiction of an actual child engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 97-5-33(5). Renfrow moved to dismiss Count II of the indictment on the basis that section 97-5-33(5) is unconstitutionally vague.\n\n\u00b6 15. The circuit court denied Renfrow's motion and held as follows:\n\nI agree subsection (5) of 97-5-33 does not contain the word \"knowingly\" or \"willfully\" or anything like that. In a sense, the indictment which does contain the word \"willfully\" and which has been equated numerous times, dozens, if not hundreds, of times with knowingly in all kinds of different cases by our supreme court. The indictment in effect puts more burden on the State than the statute does. The State has nailed themselves down to proving that the defendant *625 willfully, i.e., knowingly, possessed this alleged child pornography. The statute doesn't say they have to do it, but the indictment does. So that's what you're stuck with. So, for this case, that motion is denied.\n\u00b6 16. Renfrow claims the circuit court erred. Our supreme court has directed that, upon review of a circuit court's decision to deny a motion to dismiss the indictment based on a claim that a statute is unconstitutionally vague, the appropriate test is to determine \"whether the statute defines the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness such that a person of ordinary intelligence has fair notice of what conduct is prohibited.\" Lewis v. State, 765 So. 2d 493, 499(\u00b6 25) (Miss.2000).\n\n\u00b6 17. Renfrow notes that section 97-5-33(1), (3), (6), and (7) contain a mens rea aspect, but section 97-5-33(5) does not contain a mens rea aspect. According to Renfrow's logic, \"to allow this section to stand as written, without requiring some mental element on the part of a defendant, would be tantamount to not affording a person of ordinary intelligence, [sic] fair notice of exactly what conduct is prohibited.\" Renfrow also argues that section 97-5-33(5), as written, punishes people who have unintentionally or unknowingly had child pornography placed on their computers through computer viruses or computer hackers.\n\n\u00b6 18. There can be no doubt that a criminal statute is not unconstitutionally vague solely because it does not contain a mens rea element. \"The Legislature may define a crime which depends on no mental element and consists only of forbidden acts or omissions.\" Roberson v. State, 501 So. 2d 398, 401 (Miss.1987) (quoting Wright v. State, 236 So. 2d 408, 413 (Miss. 1970)). \"In that instance, the intent to do the forbidden act is the only intent necessary to complete the offense.\" Id.\n\n\u00b6 19. However, our decision need not turn on whether section 97-5-33(5) is unconstitutionally vague simply because it does not contain a mens rea element. The State charged Renfrow with willful possession of child pornography. That is, Count II of the indictment against Renfrow contained language that included an allegation that Renfrow willfully possessed child pornography. By including that language, the State imposed a mens rea requirement, and it was obligated to prove that aspect of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently, under the circumstances, it is irrelevant that section 97-5-33(5) does not include a mens rea element. We find no merit to this issue.\n\nII. RENFROW'S ATTEMPTS TO SUPPRESS THE EVIDENCE\n\n\u00b6 20. Renfrow filed multiple motions intended to suppress the evidence against him. Based on several different rationales, Renfrow vigorously attempted to suppress the evidence that was obtained from his computer. Renfrow also attempted to suppress Investigator Gunter's written recollection of Renfrow's March 16, 2007, interview. For clarity's sake, we have restructured Renfrow's issues and the various lines of reasoning for those issues. As we review Renfrow's litany of arguments under these issues, we are mindful of our standard of review. \"The standard of review regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence is abuse of discretion.\" Terrell v. State, 952 So. 2d 998, 1005(\u00b6 31) (Miss.Ct.App.2006). We will only find an abuse of discretion if \"a defendant shows clear prejudice resulting from an undue lack of constraint on the prosecution or undue constraint on the defense.\" Id. In other words, \"[t]his Court shall not disturb a trial court's decision unless it is clearly wrong.\" Id.\n\n*626 A. RENFROW'S COMPUTER\n\n\u00b6 21. Renfrow repeatedly sought to suppress any and all evidence that the State obtained from his computer. Renfrow's reasoning was based on the following concepts: (1) there was no probable cause to issue the search warrant because the events that led to Investigator Gunter's decision to obtain the search warrant occurred long before Investigator Gunter sought to obtain the warrant; (2) his computer was contaminated by viruses while it was in the State's custody; (3) there was a discrepancy between the computer's actual serial number and the serial number as recorded by the Cyber Crime Center; and (4) the State failed to establish a proper chain of custody. We discuss each of Renfrow's arguments in turn.\n\n1. Probable Cause for the Search Warrant\n\n\u00b6 22. Renfrow claims there was no probable cause for the search warrant that allowed Investigator Gunter to seize the computer. We must exercise caution while discussing this claim, because the State dismissed count one of the two-count indictment by nolle prosequi, and there is still a possibility that the State could re-indict Renfrow for those allegations. In any event, Renfrow contends that the circuit court erred when it did not find that there was no probable cause to issue the search warrant because, according to the two children central to this case, the alleged inappropriate touching occurred nine or ten months before Investigator Gunter sought to obtain the search warrant.\n\n\u00b6 23. The circuit court judge stated, \"as I see the motion, the narrow issue is whether . . . dismissing Court One affected the search warrant. I find it does not.\" According to Renfrow, \"the information relied upon was given by two young children almost one year after the alleged incident, and [it] cannot be deemed credible because they could not state a specific date for the alleged incident.\" Renfrow concludes that \"the time lapse of almost one year certainly rendered the search warrant stale.\" We disagree.\n\n\u00b6 24. \"When reviewing a finding of probable cause to issue a warrant[,] this Court does not make a de novo determination of probable cause, but only determines if there was a substantial basis for the magistrate's determination of probable cause.\" Foley v. State, 914 So. 2d 677, 685(\u00b6 12) (Miss.2005) (citation and internal quotations omitted). \"The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision based on all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the `veracity' and `basis of knowledge' of persons supplying hearsay information.\" Id. at 685-86.\n\n\u00b6 25. Renfrow claims that, because the children at issue did not notify an adult of the alleged inappropriate touching and the images on Renfrow's computer for approximately ten or eleven months, there was no probable cause for the search warrant. \"[S]taleness of information may be a defect in probable cause for search warrants.\" Flake v. State, 948 So. 2d 493, 496(\u00b6 9) (Miss.Ct.App.2007). However, \"[t]he determination of factual currency in the affidavit for a search warrant would be but one factor in the totality of the circumstances for establishing the existence of probable cause.\" Id.\n\n\u00b6 26. Although it is true that the children involved in the underlying alleged incident stated that Renfrow showed them pictures of naked adults and children on his computer and suggested that Renfrow may have touched them inappropriately sometime in April or May 2005, that is not the end of the analysis. Authorities were unaware of the allegation until March *627 2006. As mentioned, Erwin, a child advocacy counselor, interviewed the children promptly after one of the children first gave a school counselor reason for concern. Investigator Gunter promptly received a copy of the videotape of Erwin's interviews. After Investigator Gunter watched the interview, he promptly sought to obtain the search warrant. The probable cause for the search warrant was not rendered stale simply because Investigator Gunter first discovered the allegations nine or ten months after the alleged incident occurred. This is especially true in the context of allegations by small children, who may be too ashamed or frightened to inform others that something inappropriate may have occurred because they were expressly ordered or threatened to remain silent. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we find that there was a substantial basis for the issuance of the search warrant. Additionally, it was reasonable for the judge who issued the search warrant to conclude that images on a computer could still be recovered by forensic methods nine or ten months after the children saw them. Sullivan's examination report stated that she was able to recover \"all available files[,] including those previously deleted.\" Accordingly, because the images were stored on a computer, the probable cause for Investigator Gunter's search warrant was not rendered stale by the passage of time. We find no merit to this issue.\n\n2. Integrity of the Original Hard Drive\n\n\u00b6 27. Renfrow claims that the circuit court should have prohibited the State from introducing any evidence that was obtained from his computer because the State failed to protect the integrity of Renfrow's original hard drive. Renfrow contends that there are three reasons to conclude that the State failed to protect the integrity of the original hard drive: (1) the possibility that Renfrow's hard drive was exposed to virus contamination while in the custody of the Cyber Crime Center; (2) the presence of two \"bad sectors\" on Renfrow's original hard drive; and (3) his allegation that the Cyber Crime Center did not have a sufficient fail-safe system to protect the integrity of the original hard drive.\n\ni. Virus Contamination\n\n\u00b6 28. Renfrow claims that the circuit court should have suppressed the evidence that was obtained from his computer because the original hard drive might have been exposed to virus contamination while it was in the State's custody. According to Renfrow, his original hard drive was probably contaminated while it was in the Cyber Crime Center's custody \"because so many people had access to the [evidence] vault and made copies from the original hard drive.\" First and foremost, Renfrow's statement is a mischaracterization of the evidence. According to the expert witnesses from the Cyber Crime Center, two or three people had access to the Cyber Crime Center's vault at any given time.\n\n\u00b6 29. Moreover, Renfrow's argument under this heading is purely speculative. There is absolutely no evidence in the record that either the original or one of the forensic duplicate copies of Renfrow's hard drive were ever exposed to computer virus contamination while in the State's custody. While there was some testimony that there were viruses, spyware, adware, or \"Trojan\" programs on Renfrow's original hard drive, there was no evidence that those items first appeared on the original hard drive while it was in the State's custody. The only reasonable inference is that those items were on Renfrow's original hard drive when Investigator Gunter seized Renfrow's entire computer. There was no *628 testimony that those items were not on Renfrow's hard drive before Investigator Gunter seized Renfrow's computer. There was no evidence that anyone from the Cyber Crime Center exposed Renfrow's hard drive to possible contamination by logging on the Internet or any other source of contamination. Additionally, the State's expert witnesses testified that their use of a \"write-blocker\" prevented any alterations to Renfrow's original hard drive. Renfrow never presented any evidence to the contrary. There is no merit to this purely speculative claim.\n\nii. The Presence of \"Bad Sectors\" on the Original Hard Drive\n\n\u00b6 30. Renfrow's next argument under this heading involves the presence of two \"bad sectors\" on the original hard drive. To support his claim that the Cyber Crime Center failed to protect the integrity of his original hard drive, Renfrow references a portion of Leavitt's testimony in which Leavitt testified that there were two \"bad sectors\" on Renfrow's original hard drive. Renfrow states that Leavitt \"testified that the damaged hard drives have something to do with the way the hard drive operates.\" Although Renfrow accurately states that Leavitt found two \"bad sectors\" on Renfrow's hard drive, Renfrow is inaccurate in the remainder of his characterization of Leavitt's testimony.\n\n\u00b6 31. Leavitt testified that he found two \"bad sectors\" on Renfrow's hard drive. The State asked Leavitt to elaborate on what the \"bad sectors\" meant. Leavitt testified:\n\nA bad sector typically could mean some type of physical damage to the hard drive. These are electronic parts. They have physical moving parts, and they become damaged just like maybe your cassette tape that you listen to in the radio might\u2014portions of it could get damaged where you couldn't hear it. It's the same way with a hard drive. Those portions of the hard drive can become damaged and be unusuable by the\u2014by the hardware.\nLeavitt went on to testify that it is not uncommon to find bad sectors on a hard drive. Leavitt explained that he examined the damaged sectors to determine whether there was any information stored on them and found no information. Additionally, Leavitt testified that the two damaged sectors would have held very little information. The State asked Leavitt to elaborate regarding the information that could be stored on the two damaged sectors compared to the information that could be stored on the entire hard drive. Leavitt explained that the two sectors would represent \"maybe a crumb\" of an entire pie.\n\n\u00b6 32. On cross-examination, Renfrow's attorney asked Leavitt whether the two \"bad sectors\" would influence the way Renfrow's computer operated. Leavitt testified that they would not influence the way Renfrow's computer operated, but they would influence the way the hard drive operated in that the hard drive would skip over the two damaged sectors and simply move on to the next undamaged sector of the hard drive. Renfrow's attorney never asked Leavitt to testify as to how the \"bad sectors\" might have become damaged. Additionally, Renfrow's computer expert, Nannette Pate, did not discuss the presence of the \"bad sectors\" during her testimony. As a result, there was no evidence that the \"bad sectors\" were damaged during the time Renfrow's hard drive was in the custody of the Simpson County Sheriff's Department or the Cyber Crime Center. Instead, Sullivan's and Leavitt's testimonies were that the Cyber Crime Center's first priority was to maintain the integrity of the original hard drive. There is no basis to conclude *629 that the presence of the \"bad sectors\" are indicative of the Cyber Crime Center's failure to protect the integrity of Renfrow's original hard drive. Renfrow's claim under this heading is entirely meritless.\n\niii. The Cyber Crime Center's Fail-Safe Systems\n\n\u00b6 33. Finally, Renfrow claims the circuit court should have suppressed the evidence that was obtained from his computer because the Cyber Crime Center did not have adequate fail-safe systems to protect the integrity of his original hard drive. Again, Renfrow completely mischaracterizes the evidence.\n\n\u00b6 34. Investigator Gunter testified that Renfrow's computer was off when he first encountered it in Renfrow's home. Investigator Gunter simply unplugged Renfrow's computer when he seized it. He did not turn on Renfrow's computer to prevent the possibility of any alterations to Renfrow's hard drive. He placed evidence tape over the plug ports to the computer to prevent anyone from hooking the computer up and turning it on.\n\n\u00b6 35. Sullivan and Leavitt testified in great detail regarding the Cyber Crime Center's fail-safe systems. They described how each aspect of the Cyber Crime Center's fail-safe systems and the investigative process were designed specifically to protect the integrity of an original hard drive. Sullivan removed the original hard drive and placed a write-blocking device on it to prevent any alterations to the original hard drive. Sullivan made an exact copy of the hard drive and examined the copy. The intended purpose behind examining the copy was to protect the integrity of the original hard drive. Leavitt made a similar duplicate copy for Renfrow's expert to examine. Again, the specific purpose of making a copy was to protect the integrity of the original evidence. Renfrow's attorney wanted to boot up the original hard drive so his expert could examine it. The State opposed Renfrow's request and explained that booting up the original hard drive would destroy the integrity of the original evidence. Suffice it to say, every step of the State's procedure to gather evidence from the original hard drive was designed to protect the integrity of the evidence. This issue, like the other two under this heading, is meritless.\n\n3. Discrepancy in Serial Numbers\n\n\u00b6 36. Renfrow draws our attention to a discrepancy in his serial number as it appears on his computer and the serial number that the Cyber Crime Center placed on an evidence receipt when Investigator Gunter delivered Renfrow's computer to the Cyber Crime Center. Renfrow makes mention of the discrepancy in his claim that the State failed to establish a chain of custody. For brevity's sake, we discuss that issue in a separate heading.\n\n\u00b6 37. Renfrow's computer bore the serial number XXXXXXXXXX. When Leavitt filled out the evidence receipt, he listed the serial number as XXXXXXXXX. After the hearing on Renfrow's first volley of motions, the circuit court found that the discrepancy in the serial numbers was nothing more than a clerical error. Sullivan's report bore the same serial number that appeared on the computer. While Renfrow references the discrepancy in his brief and implies that the discrepancy somehow reflects on the State's chain of custody, he provides no argument to suggest that the circuit court erred when it found that the discrepancy in recording the computer's serial number was anything more than a clerical error involved with omitting one repetitive digit in the serial *630 number. Consequently, we do not find that the circuit court abused its discretion when it declined to suppress the evidence obtained from the computer simply due to a clerical error.\n\n4. Chain of Custody\n\n\u00b6 38. Next, Renfrow claims that the circuit court should have suppressed evidence that the State obtained from the copy of Renfrow's original hard drive because the State failed to demonstrate a proper chain of custody regarding his computer. Renfrow's reasoning is based on the same arguments he raises regarding the Cyber Crime Center's fail-safe systems, the presence of bad sectors on his original hard drive, and the number of people who had access to the Cyber Crime Center's vault. Renfrow does not claim that any specific portion of the chain of custody was insufficient. Accordingly, for brevity's sake, it is unnecessary to discuss the entire chain of custody when the argument for suppression is based on such a broad allegation.\n\n\u00b6 39. Yet again, Renfrow's claim is based on a mischaracterization of the evidence. There was no testimony that \"so many\" people had access to the Cyber Crime Center's evidence vault. Instead, Sullivan testified that, depending on the actual date, either two or three people at any given time had a key to access the Cyber Crime Center's evidence vault. The State presented the Cyber Crime Center's evidence log. That log detailed each time either Renfrow's original hard drive or a copy of the original hard drive were removed from the Cyber Crime Center's vault. The evidence log also detailed who removed the original hard drive or a copy of the original hard drive. Because the State presented an adequate chain of custody and Renfrow failed to point out any specific inadequacy in that chain of custody, we find no merit to this allegation.\n\n5. Duplicate Copy of the Hard Drive\n\n\u00b6 40. In his final claim under this heading, Renfrow argues that the circuit court \"erred in allowing the introduction of the copy of the hard drive as opposed to the original.\" There is no merit to this claim. Sullivan and Leavitt both explained why it was necessary to create a duplicate copy of the original hard drive and why it was necessary to test the duplicate. A forensic examination of Renfrow's original hard drive would have altered the original hard drive and, by extension, would have completely destroyed any evidentiary value of the original hard drive. To maintain the integrity of the original hard drive, it was necessary to create a forensic duplicate of the original hard drive and then conduct all examinations on the forensic duplicate. There is no merit to this claim.\n\nB. RENFROW'S STATEMENT\n\n\u00b6 41. Next, Renfrow argues that the circuit court erred when it did not suppress Investigator Gunter's statement regarding his recollection of his interview of Renfrow. In an effort to serve Renfrow with a capias, Investigator Gunter left a note on Renfrow's door and requested that Renfrow report to the Simpson County Sheriff's Department. Investigator Gunter's note only included a request that Renfrow go to the sheriff's department. Investigator Gunter's note did not mention the capias.\n\n\u00b6 42. In any event, Renfrow went to the sheriff's department as requested. However, once there, Renfrow expressed his willingness to waive his rights and submit to an interview by Investigator Gunter. Renfrow executed a document and waived his rights. Investigator Gunter interviewed Renfrow while Sheriff Lewis sat-in *631 on the interview. Investigator Gunter intended to create a videotape of the interview.\n\n\u00b6 43. After the interview, Investigator Gunter discovered that he had only obtained a video recording of Renfrow's interview. Investigator Gunter did not have any audio recording of the interview. Investigator Gunter then \"immediately sat down and did a statement of facts to what he and Mr. Renfrow [had] talked about.\" Sheriff Lewis signed Investigator Gunter's recollection of the interview and indicated that he agreed with Investigator Gunter's recollection. According to Investigator Gunter, during the interview, Renfrow stated that he knew he had child pornography on his computer. However, he also stated that he obtained the child pornography inadvertently. According to Renfrow, people on the Internet sent the images without his solicitation of them.\n\n\u00b6 44. Renfrow filed a motion to suppress Investigator Gunter's statement regarding the interview. The circuit court denied Renfrow's motion. Renfrow claims the circuit court erred. According to Renfrow, the circuit court should have suppressed Investigator Gunter's statement because: (1) it was not voluntary because Investigator Gunter enticed Renfrow to come to the sheriff's department; (2) Renfrow never signed the statement; and (3) it was not Renfrow's statement; instead, it was merely Investigator Gunter's recollection of what was said during Renfrow's interview.\n\n\u00b6 45. As for Renfrow's claim that Investigator Gunter enticed him to go to the sheriff's department, Investigator Gunter merely left a note at Renfrow's house. In that note, Investigator Gunter requested that Renfrow go to the sheriff's department, but Investigator Gunter did not ask Renfrow to waive his rights or agree to be interviewed. There is no evidence that Investigator Gunter or anyone else promised Renfrow anything in exchange for his agreeing to be interviewed. There is no evidence that Renfrow went to the sheriff's department or agreed to be interviewed based on any enticement by Investigator Gunter or anyone else. We find no error in the circuit court's decision to deny suppressing Investigator Gunter's recollection statement based on Renfrow's allegation of enticement.\n\n\u00b6 46. Renfrow claims that the circuit court should have suppressed Investigator Gunter's recollection of Renfrow's interview because it was not actually Renfrow's statement and Renfrow never signed Investigator Gunter's recollection statement. However, admissibility of an unsigned statement is an issue of the accuracy of a statement and not the voluntariness of a statement. Craft v. State, 380 So. 2d 251, 254 (Miss.1980). We find no merit to Renfrow's claim that the circuit court erred when it declined to suppress Investigator Gunter's recollection statement based on the fact that it was Investigator Gunter's recollection of the interview and Renfrow did not sign the statement. Those matters pertained to the weight and credibility of the statement, and those matters are for the jury to consider. \"Matters concerning what weight and credibility to give to the evidence presented are to be decided by the jury.\" Walker v. State, 799 So. 2d 151, 153(\u00b6 4) (Miss.Ct.App.2001). It bears mentioning that Investigator Gunter's recollection of Renfrow's statements corroborated Renfrow's defense at trial. That is, Investigator Gunter noted that Renfrow said he did not solicit the images depicting child pornography and that Renfrow did not intentionally obtain the images. That was Renfrow's theory of the case. Accordingly, Renfrow was not prejudiced by the circuit court's decision to deny Renfrow's motion to suppress Investigator *632 Gunter's recollection of Renfrow's interview. This issue is without merit.\n\nIII. RENFROW'S MOTIONS FOR CONTINUANCE\n\n\u00b6 47. On February 28, 2008, Renfrow filed a motion for a continuance. At that time, Renfrow's trial was scheduled for March 19, 2008. Renfrow requested a continuance so that his attorney would have time to review discovery that the State had provided on February 8, 2008. Renfrow also filed a motion to view the evidence. In that motion, Renfrow requested that the circuit court allow his computer expert to review Renfrow's hard drive. On March 7, 2008, the circuit court conducted a hearing on Renfrow's numerous pretrial motions. During that hearing, Renfrow's attorney complained that, although the State had provided its reports regarding the presence of child pornography on Renfrow's computer, Renfrow's computer expert had not had an opportunity to personally observe and review a copy of Renfrow's hard drive. The circuit court judge stated that he would \"grant [Renfrow's] motion [to view the evidence] with respect to going and viewing the evidence.\" Accordingly, the circuit court judge instructed the State to provide Renfrow's attorney with dates that Renfrow's expert could go to the Cyber Crime Center and review a copy of Renfrow's hard drive. Additionally, the circuit court judge rescheduled Renfrow's trial date to March 27, 2008.\n\n\u00b6 48. On March 19, 2008, Renfrow filed another motion for a continuance. In his second motion for a continuance, Renfrow claimed that he had \"still been denied . . . access to all of the evidence of the State in this matter, more particularly, the original hard drive and the original computer intact as it was obtained.\" In other words, Renfrow requested that the circuit court continue his trial until his computer expert could inspect Renfrow's original hard drive after re-installing the hard drive in Renfrow's computer tower. On March 20, 2008, the circuit court conducted a hearing on Renfrow's second barrage of pretrial motions.\n\n\u00b6 49. During the hearing on Renfrow's second motion for a continuance, the State vigorously objected to Renfrow's computer expert being allowed to re-install and inspect Renfrow's original hard drive. Leavitt testified during that hearing. Leavitt explained that Renfrow's expert would destroy the evidentiary value if she was allowed to install it in Renfrow's tower and boot it up.[3] Leavitt elaborated and testified that, if one were to boot up Renfrow's original hard drive without attaching the write-blocking device, \"over 1,000 files would be changed immediately.\" The \"registry files\" would be modified, and the original data could never be recovered again. Leavitt explained that booting up the original hard drive would also change all of the \"time date stamps\" throughout the computer and the \"log files would be changed, deleted, or recreated in some cases.\" Finally, Leavitt testified that if Renfrow's expert were allowed to do as Renfrow requested, that act would \"certainly change the entire makeup of [Renfrow's] hard drive.\" On cross-examination, Leavitt explained that neither he nor anyone else who performs forensic examinations for the Cyber Crime Center ever examined an original hard drive or booted up a copy of a hard drive\u2014much less an original hard drive\u2014without using the previously-mentioned write blocker. The circuit court resolved the matter by instructing *633 the Cyber Crime Center to allow Renfrow's expert to create her own forensic duplicate copy of Renfrow's original hard drive. However, when Renfrow's expert appeared at the Cyber Crime Center, she was not equipped to prepare her own duplicate. Consequently, Leavitt prepared another duplicate copy of Renfrow's original hard drive as Renfrow's expert, Pate, observed. To summarize, Pate had access to two forensic duplicates of Renfrow's original hard drive.\n\n\u00b6 50. Renfrow claims that the circuit court erred when it denied his motion for continuance. \"Trial judges have wide latitude in deciding whether to grant continuances, and that decision is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\" Evans v. State, 899 So. 2d 890, 896(\u00b6 23) (Miss.Ct.App.2004) (quoting Adams v. State, 772 So. 2d 1010, 1014(\u00b6 16) (Miss. 2000)). A trial court's decision to deny a motion for a continuance is not reversible \"unless manifest injustice appears to have resulted from the denial.\" Id.\n\n\u00b6 51. First and foremost, Renfrow does not indicate what his attorney or his expert might have discovered if the circuit court would have granted his motion for a continuance. Additionally, the undisputed testimony during the hearing on Renfrow's second motion for a continuance was that Renfrow's expert would destroy the evidentiary value of the evidence if the circuit court consented to Renfrow's request. What is more, Renfrow seems to argue that, if the circuit court would have granted his second motion for a continuance, his attorney or his expert might have made some unspecified discovery that may or may not have benefitted his defense. Renfrow had no specific purpose in mind. He simply wanted more time to see if his expert could find something. The circuit court granted Renfrow's first motion for a continuance and gave Renfrow's expert more than one opportunity to review the same evidence that the State had. As the State notes, Renfrow's attorney presented no proof as to how he could have been better prepared to defend Renfrow if he would have had additional time to prepare for trial. Under the circumstances, we find that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Renfrow's second motion for a continuance. Accordingly, we find no merit to this issue.\n\nIV. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n\u00b6 52. Renfrow claims the evidence against him was insufficient to convict him of possession of child pornography. In summary, he argues that: he did not know those files were on his computer; he never sent the files to anyone; and he was a novice with using computers.\n\n\u00b6 53. \"A motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict is a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.\" Gilbert v. State, 934 So. 2d 330, 335(\u00b6 9) (Miss.Ct.App.2006). As our Mississippi Supreme Court has stated:\n\nin considering whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction in the face of a motion for directed verdict or for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the critical inquiry is whether the evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that accused committed the act charged, and that he did so under such circumstances that every element of the offense existed; and where the evidence fails to meet this test it is insufficient to support a conviction. . . . [T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Should the facts and inferences considered in a challenge to the sufficiency of *634 the evidence point in favor of the defendant on any element of the offense with sufficient force that reasonable men could not have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty, the proper remedy is for the appellate court to reverse and render.\nBush v. State, 895 So. 2d 836, 843(\u00b6 16) (Miss.2005) (internal citations and quotations omitted). However, this Court will determine that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the jury's verdict if the evidence was \"of such quality and weight that, having in mind the beyond a reasonable doubt burden of proof standard, reasonable fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions on every element of the offense.\" Id. (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\n\u00b6 54. Renfrow was indicted for possession of child pornography in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-5-33(5). As mentioned, although section 97-5-33(5) does not contain a mens rea element, the language of the indictment included an allegation that Renfrow willfully possessed the images depicting child pornography.\n\n\u00b6 55. It was undisputed that several images depicting child pornography were found on Renfrow's computer. Renfrow argued that he did not solicit the images at issue and that he obtained them inadvertently. According to Renfrow, he had limited knowledge about computers, and the images appeared on his computer after he clicked the word \"attachment\" at the bottom of the computer screen while using a \"chat program\" called ICQ. However, Renfrow also attempted to attribute the child pornography images to other sources. Pate, Renfrow's expert witness, testified that: (a) she found numerous viruses on the duplicate clone of Renfrow's hard drive; (b) she found a \"porn net Trojan virus\" on Renfrow's computer; (c) the \"porn net Trojan virus\" causes adult pornographic images pop up on a computer screen; (d) she found a \"backdoor Trojan virus\" that allows someone to take control of a computer without an owner's knowledge; (e) a \"backdoor Trojan virus\" can hide and disguise itself; and (f) Renfrow could have accepted the images without knowing exactly what they were.\n\n\u00b6 56. However, there was no evidence that any of the computer viruses or other programs that Pate described actually transferred any of the images of child pornography. Pate's testimony in that regard was merely that the viruses or \"Trojan\" programs theoretically could have been the reason the images at issue were on Renfrow's computer. Pate's testimony was in stark contrast to Sullivan's testimony and Leavitt's testimony. Both Leavitt and Sullivan testified that viruses or \"Trojan\" programs were not responsible for placing the pornographic images of children on Renfrow's computer. Leavitt testified that, because Renfrow used a dial-up internet connection that used \"dynamic IP addressing,\" it was impossible for someone to remotely control Renfrow's computer. Both Leavitt and Sullivan testified that Renfrow created a file under the title \"PEDO\" and stored the images at issue in that file. Leavitt testified that one of the images of child pornography was attached to an e-mail that was stored in Renfrow's \"outbox.\" Renfrow's e-mail was protected by a password.\n\n\u00b6 57. Additionally, the State's experts discovered e-mails that were sent from Renfrow's e-mail address. The only inference presented at trial was that Renfrow wrote the stories contained in each e-mail.[4]*635 One such e-mail included a story that Renfrow wrote in which a fifteen-year-old boy reminisced in extremely graphic detail how he became attracted to his pre-teen sister and eventually raped her. In a different e-mail, Renfrow wrote a story about a father who proudly reminisces in extremely graphic detail about the time he encouraged his twelve-year-old twin son and daughter to have sex with one another. In that story, the father molested both children, and after encouraging his twelve-year-old twin children to have sex with one another, the father committed statutory rape of his twelve-year-old daughter. The father continued to do so for months, until his daughter became pregnant. In the story within that e-mail, the father closed by describing how he held his granddaughter while hoping for more grandchildren so he could \"educate\" another generation of his family. In yet another e-mail, Renfrow wrote a story about an adult male who fondly described having sex with his pre-teen niece and daughter.\n\n\u00b6 58. Finally, Dr. Larry Gibson, a physician certified in family medicine, testified that the images at issue depicted sexually explicit conduct involving girls as young as six or seven years old. According to Dr. Gibson, the eldest child depicted in the various images was approximately twelve years old.\n\n\u00b6 59. We can confidently conclude that reasonable and fair-minded jurors could have found that the State proved each element of the offense as stated in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we find that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Renfrow's motion for a JNOV. We find no merit to this issue.\n\nV. WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n\u00b6 60. Renfrow claims the circuit court erred when it denied his motion for a new trial. According to Renfrow, the circuit court should have granted his motion for a new trial because the jury's verdict is contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence. We are mindful that, as we review the circuit court's decision to deny a motion for a new trial, this Court \"will only disturb a verdict when it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence that to allow it to stand would sanction an unconscionable injustice.\" Bush, 895 So.2d at 844(\u00b6 18). The supreme court has further instructed that, when reviewing a trial court's decision to deny a motion for a new trial:\n\nthe court sits as a thirteenth juror. The motion, however, is addressed to the discretion of the court, which should be exercised with caution, and the power to grant a new trial should be invoked only in exceptional cases in which the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict. However, the evidence should be weighed in the light most favorable to the verdict. A reversal on the grounds that the verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence, unlike a reversal based on insufficient evidence, does not mean that acquittal was the only proper verdict. Rather, as the \"thirteenth juror,\" the court simply disagrees with the jury's resolution of the conflicting testimony. This difference of opinion does not signify acquittal any more than a disagreement among the jurors themselves. Instead, the proper remedy is to grant a new trial.\nId. (footnote and internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\n*636 \u00b6 61. To support this issue, Renfrow discusses the same matters that he discussed to support his challenge of the sufficiency of the evidence. Based on evidence discussed in the analysis under Renfrow's challenge of the sufficiency evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, we find that the jury's verdict was not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence that to allow it to stand would sanction an unconscionable injustice. We find no merit to this issue.\n\n\u00b6 62. THE JUDGMENT OF THE SIMPSON COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT OF CONVICTION OF POSSESSION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY AND SENTENCE OF FIFTEEN YEARS IN THE CUSTODY OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IS AFFIRMED. ALL COSTS OF THIS APPEAL ARE ASSESSED TO THE APPELLANT.\n\nKING, C.J., LEE AND MYERS, P.JJ., IRVING, GRIFFIS, BARNES, ISHEE, CARLTON AND MAXWELL, JJ., CONCUR.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] We omit the children's names from this opinion to maintain their anonymity.\n\n[2] Those allegations will be discussed in slightly greater detail as necessary. However, Renfrow was indicted for those allegations at the same time he was indicted for possession of child pornography. The State nolle prossed the inappropriate touching count of the indictment, and Renfrow has not been prosecuted for any alleged inappropriate touching of the children. Because there is still a possibility that Renfrow may be prosecuted for those allegations, we have avoided discussing them in any detail except as necessary. No portion of this opinion should be construed as a finding related to those potential allegations.\n\n[3] Using forensic computer tools and programs, it is possible to compare an original hard drive to a forensic duplicate of a hard drive to test for consistency. However, those tools and programs avoid having to boot up an original hard drive.\n\n[4] The State's experts found an e-mail from someone who was replying to an earlier e-mail from Renfrow. In Renfrow's earlier e-mail, Renfrow stated that he was writing stories about \"very young girls\" and that one of his stories was about \"a father and his 9-year-old daughter.\" Renfrow also asked the recipient whether he was offended by incest.", "annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 53}, {"start": 54, "end": 85}, {"start": 86, "end": 112}, {"start": 113, "end": 146}, {"start": 147, "end": 171},

In the course of the stop, the officer also learned that Riley\u2019s license had been suspended. The officer impounded Riley\u2019s car, pursuant to department policy, and another officer conducted an inventory search of the car. Riley was arrested for possession of concealed and loaded firearms when that search turned up two handguns under the car\u2019s hood. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a712025(a)(1), 12031(a)(1) (West 2009).\n\nAn officer searched Riley incident to the arrest and found items associated with the \u201cBloods\u201d street gang. He also seized a cell phone from Riley\u2019s pants pocket. According to Riley\u2019s uncontradicted assertion, the phone was a \u201csmart phone,\u201d a cell phone with a broad range of other functions based on advanced computing capability, large storage capacity, and Internet connectivity. The officer accessed information on the phone and noticed that some words (presumably in text messages or a contacts list) were preceded by the letters \u201cCK\u201d\u2014a label that, he believed, stood for \u201cCrip Killers,\u201d a slang term for members of the Bloods gang.\n\nAt the police station about two hours after the arrest, a detective specializing in gangs further examined the contents of the phone. The detective testified that he \u201cwent through\u201d Riley\u2019s phone \u201clooking for evidence, because . . . gang members will often video themselves with guns or take pictures of themselves with the guns.\u201d App. in No. 13\u2013132, p. 20. Although there was \u201ca lot of stuff\u201d on the phone, particular files that \u201ccaught [the detective\u2019s] eye\u201d included videos of young men sparring while someone yelled encouragement using the moniker \u201cBlood.\u201d Id., at 11\u201313. The police also found photographs of Riley standing in front of a car they suspected had been involved in a shooting a few weeks earlier.\n\nRiley was ultimately charged, in connection with that earlier shooting, with firing at an occupied vehicle, assault with a semiautomatic firearm, and attempted murder. The State alleged that Riley had committed those crimes for the benefit of a criminal street gang, an aggravating factor that carries an enhanced sentence. Compare Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7246 (2008) with \u00a7186.22(b)(4)(B) (2014). Prior to trial, Riley moved to suppress all evidence that the police had obtained from his cell phone. He contended that the searches of his phone violated the Fourth Amendment, because they had been performed without a warrant and were not otherwise justified by exigent circumstances. The trial court rejected that argument. App. in No. 13\u2013132, at 24, 26. At Riley\u2019s trial, police officers testified about the photographs and videos found on the phone, and some of the photographs were admitted into evidence. Riley was convicted on all three counts and received an enhanced sentence of 15 years to life in prison.\n\nThe California Court of Appeal affirmed. No. D059840 (Cal. App., Feb. 8, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 13\u2013132, pp. 1a\u201323a. The court relied on the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in People v. Diaz, 51 Cal. 4th 84, 244 P. 3d 501 (2011), which held that the Fourth Amendment permits a warrantless search of cell phone data incident to an arrest, so long as the cell phone was immediately associated with the arrestee\u2019s person. See id., at 93, 244 P. 3d, at 505\u2013506.\n\nThe California Supreme Court denied Riley\u2019s petition for review, App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 13\u2013132, at 24a, and we granted certiorari, 571 U. S. ___ (2014).\n\nB\n\nIn the second case, a police officer performing routine surveillance observed respondent Brima Wurie make an apparent drug sale from a car. Officers subsequently arrested Wurie and took him to the police station. At the station, the officers seized two cell phones from Wurie\u2019s person. The one at issue here was a \u201cflip phone,\u201d a kind of phone that is flipped open for use and that generally has a smaller range of features than a smart phone. Five to ten minutes after arriving at the station, the officers noticed that the phone was repeatedly receiving calls from a source identified as \u201cmy house\u201d on the phone\u2019s external screen. A few minutes later, they opened the phone and saw a photograph of a woman and a baby set as the phone\u2019s wallpaper. They pressed one button on the phone to access its call log, then another button to determine the phone number associated with the \u201cmy house\u201d label. They next used an online phone directory to trace that phone number to an apartment building.\n\nWhen the officers went to the building, they saw Wurie\u2019s name on a mailbox and observed through a window a woman who resembled the woman in the photograph on Wurie\u2019s phone. They secured the apartment while obtaining a search warrant and, upon later executing the warrant, found and seized 215 grams of crack cocaine, mari-juana, drug paraphernalia, a firearm and ammunition, and cash.\n\nWurie was charged with distributing crack cocaine, possessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute, and being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a7922(g); 21 U. S. C. \u00a7841(a). He moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of the apartment, arguing that it was the fruit of an unconstitutional search of his cell phone. The District Court denied the motion. 612 F. Supp. 2d 104 (Mass. 2009). Wurie was convicted on all three counts and sentenced to 262 months in prison.\n\nA divided panel of the First Circuit reversed the denial of Wurie\u2019s motion to suppress and vacated Wurie\u2019s convictions for possession with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm as a felon. 728 F. 3d 1 (2013). The court held that cell phones are distinct from other physical possessions that may be searched incident to arrest without a warrant, because of the amount of personal data cell phones contain and the negligible threat they pose to law enforcement interests. See id., at 8\u201311.\n\nWe granted certiorari. 571 U. S. ___ (2014).\n\nII\n\nThe Fourth Amendment provides:\n\n\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d\n\nAs the text makes clear, \u201cthe ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is \u2018reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006) . Our cases have determined that \u201c[w]here a search is undertaken by law enforcement officials to discover evidence of criminal wrongdoing, . . . reasonableness generally requires the obtaining of a judicial warrant.\u201d Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 653 (1995) . Such a warrant ensures that the inferences to support a search are \u201cdrawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u201d Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 14 (1948) . In the absence of a warrant, a search is reasonable only if it falls within a specific exception to the warrant requirement. See Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5\u20136).\n\nThe two cases before us concern the reasonableness of a warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest. In 1914, this Court first acknowledged in dictum \u201cthe right on the part of the Government, always recognized under English and American law, to search the person of the accused when legally arrested to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime.\u201d Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383. Since that time, it has been well accepted that such a search constitutes an exception to the warrant requirement. Indeed, the label \u201cexception\u201d is something of a misnomer in this context, as warrantless searches incident to arrest occur with far greater frequency than searches conducted pursuant to a warrant. See 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a75.2(b), p. 132, and n. 15 (5th ed. 2012).\n\nAlthough the existence of the exception for such searches has been recognized for a century, its scope has been de-bated for nearly as long. See Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. 332, 350 (2009) (noting the exception\u2019s \u201ccheckered his-tory\u201d). That debate has focused on the extent to which officers may search property found on or near the arrestee. Three related precedents set forth the rules governing such searches:\n\nThe first, Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969) , laid the groundwork for most of the existing search incident to arrest doctrine. Police officers in that case arrested Chimel inside his home and proceeded to search his entire three-bedroom house, including the attic and garage. In particular rooms, they also looked through the contents of drawers. Id., at 753\u2013754.\n\nThe Court crafted the following rule for assessing the reasonableness of a search incident to arrest:\n\n\u201cWhen an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that the latter might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape. Otherwise, the officer\u2019s safety might well be endangered, and the arrest itself frustrated. In addition, it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee\u2019s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction. . . . There is ample justification, therefore, for a search of the arrestee\u2019s person and the area \u2018within his immediate control\u2019\u2014construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d Id., at 762\u2013763.\n\nThe extensive warrantless search of Chimel\u2019s home did not fit within this exception, because it was not needed to protect officer safety or to preserve evidence. Id., at 763, 768.\n\nFour years later, in United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218 (1973) , the Court applied the Chimel analysis in the context of a search of the arrestee\u2019s person. A police officer had arrested Robinson for driving with a revoked license. The officer conducted a patdown search and felt an object that he could not identify in Robinson\u2019s coat pocket. He removed the object, which turned out to be a crumpled cigarette package, and opened it. Inside were 14 capsules of heroin. Id., at 220, 223.\n\nThe Court of Appeals concluded that the search was unreasonable because Robinson was unlikely to have evidence of the crime of arrest on his person, and because it believed that extracting the cigarette package and opening it could not be justified as part of a protective search for weapons. This Court reversed, rejecting the notion that \u201ccase-by-case adjudication\u201d was required to determine \u201cwhether or not there was present one of the reasons supporting the authority for a search of the person incident to a lawful arrest.\u201d Id., at 235. As the Court explained, \u201c[t]he authority to search the person incident to a lawful custodial arrest, while based upon the need to disarm and to discover evidence, does not depend on what a court may later decide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect.\u201d Ibid. Instead, a \u201ccustodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.\u201d Ibid.\n\nThe Court thus concluded that the search of Robinson was reasonable even though there was no concern about the loss of evidence, and the arresting officer had no specific concern that Robinson might be armed. Id., at 236. In doing so, the Court did not draw a line between a search of Robinson\u2019s person and a further examination of the cigarette pack found during that search. It merely noted that, \u201c[h]aving in the course of a lawful search come upon the crumpled package of cigarettes, [the officer] was entitled to inspect it.\u201d Ibid. A few years later, the Court clarified that this exception was limited to \u201cpersonal property . . . immediately associated with the person of the arrestee.\u201d United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 15 (1977) (200-pound, locked footlocker could not be searched incident to arrest), abrogated on other grounds by California v. Acevedo, 500 U. S. 565 (1991) .\n\nThe search incident to arrest trilogy concludes with Gant, which analyzed searches of an arrestee\u2019s vehicle. Gant, like Robinson, recognized that the Chimel concerns for officer safety and evidence preservation underlie the search incident to arrest exception. See 556 U. S., at 338. As a result, the Court concluded that Chimel could authorize police to search a vehicle \u201conly when the arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search.\u201d 556 U. S., at 343. Gant added, however, an independent exception for a warrantless search of a vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment \u201cwhen it is \u2018reasonable to believe evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 632 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)). That exception stems not from Chimel, the Court explained, but from \u201ccircumstances unique to the vehicle context.\u201d 556 U. S., at 343.\n\nIII\n\nThese cases require us to decide how the search incident to arrest doctrine applies to modern cell phones, which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy. A smart phone of the sort taken from Riley was unheard of ten years ago; a significant majority of American adults now own such phones. See A. Smith, Pew Research Center, Smartphone Ownership\u20142013 Update (June 5, 2013). Even less sophisticated phones like Wurie\u2019s, which have already faded in popularity since Wurie was arrested in 2007, have been around for less than 15 years. Both phones are based on technology nearly inconceivable just a few decades ago, when Chimel and Robinson were decided.\n\nAbsent more precise guidance from the founding era, we generally determine whether to exempt a given type of search from the warrant requirement \u201cby assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual\u2019s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u201d Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295, 300 (1999) . Such a balancing of interests supported the search incident to arrest exception in Robinson, and a mechanical application of Robinson might well support the warrantless searches at issue here.\n\nBut while Robinson\u2019s categorical rule strikes the appropriate balance in the context of physical objects, neither of its rationales has much force with respect to digital content on cell phones. On the government interest side, Robinson concluded that the two risks identified in Chimel\u2014harm to officers and destruction of evidence\u2014are present in all custodial arrests. There are no comparable risks when the search is of digital data. In addition, Robinson regarded any privacy interests retained by an individual after arrest as significantly diminished by the fact of the arrest itself. Cell phones, however, place vast quantities of personal information literally in the hands of individuals. A search of the information on a cell phone bears little resemblance to the type of brief physical search considered in Robinson.\n\nWe therefore decline to extend Robinson to searches of data on cell phones, and hold instead that officers must generally secure a warrant before conducting such a search.\n\nA\n\nWe first consider each Chimel concern in turn. In doing so, we do not overlook Robinson\u2019s admonition that searches of a person incident to arrest, \u201cwhile based upon theneed to disarm and to discover evidence,\u201d are reasonable regardless of \u201cthe probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found.\u201d 414 U. S., at 235. Rather than requiring the \u201ccase-by-case adjudication\u201d that Robinson rejected, ibid., we ask instead whether application of the search incident to arrest doctrine to this particular category of effects would \u201cuntether the rule from the justifications underlying the Chimel exception,\u201d Gant, supra, at 343. See also Knowles v. Iowa, 525 U. S. 113, 119 (1998) (declining to extend Robinson to the issuance of citations, \u201ca situation where the concern for officer safety is not present to the same extent and the concern for destruction or loss of evidence is not present at all\u201d).\n\n1\n\nDigital data stored on a cell phone cannot itself be used as a weapon to harm an arresting officer or to effectuate the arrestee\u2019s escape. Law enforcement officers remain free to examine the physical aspects of a phone to ensure that it will not be used as a weapon\u2014say, to determine whether there is a razor blade hidden between the phone and its case. Once an officer has secured a phone and eliminated any potential physical threats, however, data on the phone can endanger no one.\n\nPerhaps the same might have been said of the cigarette pack seized from Robinson\u2019s pocket. Once an officer gained control of the pack, it was unlikely that Robinson could have accessed the pack\u2019s contents. But unknown physical objects may always pose risks, no matter how slight, during the tense atmosphere of a custodial arrest. The officer in Robinson testified that he could not identify the objects in the cigarette pack but knew they were not cigarettes. See 414 U. S., at 223, 236, n. 7. Given that, a further search was a reasonable protective measure. No such unknowns exist with respect to digital data. As the First Circuit explained, the officers who searched Wurie\u2019s cell phone \u201cknew exactly what they would find therein: data. They also knew that the data could not harm them.\u201d 728 F. 3d, at 10.\n\nThe United States and California both suggest that a search of cell phone data might help ensure officer safety in more indirect ways, for example by alerting officers that confederates of the arrestee are headed to the scene. There is undoubtedly a strong government interest in warning officers about such possibilities, but neither the United States nor California offers evidence to suggest that their concerns are based on actual experience. The proposed consideration would also represent a broadening of Chimel\u2019s concern that an arrestee himself might grab a weapon and use it against an officer \u201cto resist arrest or effect his escape.\u201d 395 U. S., at 763. And any such threats from outside the arrest scene do not \u201clurk[ ] in all custodial arrests.\u201d Chadwick, 433 U. S., at 14\u201315. Accordingly, the interest in protecting officer safety does not justify dispensing with the warrant requirement across the board. To the extent dangers to arresting officers may be implicated in a particular way in a particular case, they are better addressed through consideration of case-specific exceptions to the warrant requirement, such as the one for exigent circumstances. See, e.g., Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294\u2013299 (1967) (\u201cThe Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others.\u201d).\n\n2\n\nThe United States and California focus primarily on the second Chimel rationale: preventing the destruction of evidence.\n\nBoth Riley and Wurie concede that officers could have seized and secured their cell phones to prevent destruction of evidence while seeking a warrant. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 13\u2013132, p. 20; Brief for Respondent in No. 13\u2013212, p. 41. That is a sensible concession. See Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U. S. 326\u2013333 (2001); Chadwick, supra, at 13, and n. 8. And once law enforcement officers have secured a cell phone, there is no longer any risk that the arrestee himself will be able to delete incriminating data from the phone.\n\nThe United States and California argue that information on a cell phone may nevertheless be vulnerable to two types of evidence destruction unique to digital data\u2014remote wiping and data encryption. Remote wiping occurs when a phone, connected to a wireless network, receives a signal that erases stored data. This can happen when a third party sends a remote signal or when a phone is preprogrammed to delete data upon entering or leaving certain geographic areas (so-called \u201cgeofencing\u201d). See Dept. of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, R. Ayers, S. Brothers, & W. Jansen, Guidelines on Mobile Device Forensics (Draft) 29, 31 (SP 800\u2013101 Rev. 1, Sept. 2013) (hereinafter Ayers). Encryption is a security feature that some modern cell phones use in addition to password protection. When such phones lock, data becomes protected by sophisticated encryption that renders a phone all but \u201cunbreakable\u201d unless police know the password. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in No. 13\u2013132, p. 11.\n\nAs an initial matter, these broader concerns about the loss of evidence are distinct from Chimel\u2019s focus on a defendant who responds to arrest by trying to conceal or destroy evidence within his reach. See 395 U. S., at 763\u2013764. With respect to remote wiping, the Government\u2019s primary concern turns on the actions of third parties who are not present at the scene of arrest. And data encryption is even further afield. There, the Government focuses on the ordinary operation of a phone\u2019s security features, apart from any active attempt by a defendant or his associates to conceal or destroy evidence upon arrest.\n\nWe have also been given little reason to believe that either problem is prevalent. The briefing reveals only a couple of anecdotal examples of remote wiping triggered by an arrest. See Brief for Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 13\u2013132, pp. 9\u201310; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13\u2013132,p. 48. Similarly, the opportunities for officers to search a password-protected phone before data becomes encrypted are quite limited. Law enforcement officers are very unlikely to come upon such a phone in an unlocked state because most phones lock at the touch of a button or, as a default, after some very short period of inactivity. See, e.g., iPhone User Guide for iOS 7.1 Software 10 (2014) (default lock after about one minute). This may explain why the encryption argument was not made until the merits stage in this Court, and has never been considered by the Courts of Appeals.\n\nMoreover, in situations in which an arrest might trigger a remote-wipe attempt or an officer discovers an unlocked phone, it is not clear that the ability to conduct a warrantless search would make much of a difference. The need to effect the arrest, secure the scene, and tend to other press-ing matters means that law enforcement officers may well not be able to turn their attention to a cell phone right away. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13\u2013132, at 50; see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in No. 13\u2013132, at 19. Cell phone data would be vulnerable to remote wiping from the time an individual anticipates arrest to the time any eventual search of the phone is completed, which might be at the station house hours later. Likewise, an officer who seizes a phone in an unlocked state might not be able to begin his search in the short time remaining before the phone locks and data becomes encrypted.\n\nIn any event, as to remote wiping, law enforcement is not without specific means to address the threat. Remote wiping can be fully prevented by disconnecting a phone from the network. There are at least two simple ways to do this: First, law enforcement officers can turn the phone off or remove its battery. Second, if they are concerned about encryption or other potential problems, they can leave a phone powered on and place it in an enclosure that isolates the phone from radio waves. See Ayers 30\u201331. Such devices are commonly called \u201cFaraday bags,\u201d after the English scientist Michael Faraday. They are essentially sandwich bags made of aluminum foil: cheap, lightweight, and easy to use. See Brief for Criminal Law Professors as Amici Curiae 9. They may not be a complete answer to the problem, see Ayers 32, but at least for now they provide a reasonable response. In fact, a number of law enforcement agencies around the country already encourage the use of Faraday bags. See, e.g., Dept. of Justice, National Institute of Justice, Electronic Crime Scene Investigation: A Guide for First Responders 14, 32 (2d ed. Apr. 2008); Brief for Criminal Law Professors as Amici Curiae 4\u20136.\n\nTo the extent that law enforcement still has specific concerns about the potential loss of evidence in a particular case, there remain more targeted ways to address those concerns. If \u201cthe police are truly confronted with a \u2018now or never\u2019 situation,\u201d\u2014for example, circumstances suggesting that a defendant\u2019s phone will be the target of an imminent remote-wipe attempt\u2014they may be able to rely on exigent circumstances to search the phone immediately. Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 10) (quoting Roaden v. Kentucky, 413 U. S. 496, 505 (1973) ; some internal quotation marks omitted). Or, if officers happen to seize a phone in an unlocked state, they may be able to disable a phone\u2019s automatic-lock feature in order to prevent the phone from locking and encrypting data. See App. to Reply Brief in No. 13\u2013132, p. 3a (diagramming the few necessary steps). Such a preventive measure could be analyzed under the principles set forth in our decision in McArthur, 531 U. S. 326, which approved officers\u2019 reasonable steps to secure a scene to preserve evidence while they awaited a warrant. See id., at 331\u2013333.\n\nB\n\nThe search incident to arrest exception rests not only on the heightened government interests at stake in a volatile arrest situation, but also on an arrestee\u2019s reduced privacy interests upon being taken into police custody. Robinson focused primarily on the first of those rationales. But it also quoted with approval then-Judge Cardozo\u2019s account of the historical basis for the search incident to arrest exception: \u201cSearch of the person becomes lawful when grounds for arrest and accusation have been discovered, and the law is in the act of subjecting the body of the accused to its physical dominion.\u201d 414 U. S., at 232 (quoting People v. Chiagles, 237 N. Y. 193, 197, 142 N. E. 583, 584 (1923)); see also 414 U. S., at 237 (Powell, J., concurring) (\u201can individual lawfully subjected to a custodial arrest retains no significant Fourth Amendment interest in the privacy of his person\u201d). Put simply, a patdown of Robinson\u2019s cloth-ing and an inspection of the cigarette pack found in his pocket constituted only minor additional intrusions compared to the substantial government authority exercised in taking Robinson into custody. See Chadwick, 433 U. S., at 16, n. 10 (searches of a person are justified in part by \u201creduced expectations of privacy caused by the arrest\u201d).\n\nThe fact that an arrestee has diminished privacy interests does not mean that the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture entirely. Not every search \u201cis acceptable solely because a person is in custody.\u201d Maryland v. King, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 26). To the contrary, when \u201cprivacy-related concerns are weighty enough\u201d a \u201csearch may require a warrant, notwithstanding the diminished expectations of privacy of the arrestee.\u201d Ibid. One such example, of course, is Chimel. Chimel refused to \u201ccharacteriz[e] the invasion of privacy that results from a top-to-bottom search of a man\u2019s house as \u2018minor.\u2019 \u201d 395 U. S., at 766\u2013767, n. 12. Because a search of the arrestee\u2019s entire house was a substantial invasion beyond the arrest itself, the Court concluded that a warrant was required.\n\nRobinson is the only decision from this Court applying Chimel to a search of the contents of an item found on an arrestee\u2019s person. In an earlier case, this Court had approved a search of a zipper bag carried by an arrestee, but the Court analyzed only the validity of the arrest itself. See Draper v. United States, 358 U. S. 307\u2013311 (1959). Lower courts applying Robinson and Chimel, however, have approved searches of a variety of personal items carried by an arrestee. See, e.g., United States v. Carrion, 809 F. 2d 1120, 1123, 1128 (CA5 1987) (billfold and address book); United States v. Watson, 669 F. 2d 1374, 1383\u20131384 (CA11 1982) (wallet); United States v. Lee, 501 F. 2d 890, 892 (CADC 1974) (purse).\n\nThe United States asserts that a search of all data stored on a cell phone is \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d from searches of these sorts of physical items. Brief for United States in No. 13\u2013212, p. 26. That is like saying a ride on horseback is materially indistinguishable from a flight to the moon. Both are ways of getting from point A to point B, but little else justifies lumping them together. Modern cell phones, as a category, implicate privacy concerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet, or a purse. A conclusion that inspecting the contents of an arrestee\u2019s pockets works no substantial additional intrusion on privacy beyond the arrest itself may make sense as applied to physical items, but any extension of that reasoning to digital data has to rest on its own bottom.\n\n1\n\nCell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense from other objects that might be kept on an arrestee\u2019s person. The term \u201ccell phone\u201d is itself misleading shorthand; many of these devices are in fact minicomputers that also happen to have the capacity to be used as a telephone. They could just as easily be called cameras, video players, rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, libraries, diaries, albums, televisions, maps, or newspapers.\n\nOne of the most notable distinguishing features of modern cell phones is their immense storage capacity. Before cell phones, a search of a person was limited by physical realities and tended as a general matter to constitute only a narrow intrusion on privacy. See Kerr, Foreword: Accounting for Technological Change, 36 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol\u2019y 403, 404\u2013405 (2013). Most people cannot lug around every piece of mail they have received for the past several months, every picture they have taken, or every book or article they have read\u2014nor would they have any reason to attempt to do so. And if they did, they would have to drag behind them a trunk of the sort held to require a search warrant in Chadwick, supra, rather than a container the size of the cigarette package in Robinson.\n\nBut the possible intrusion on privacy is not physically limited in the same way when it comes to cell phones. The current top-selling smart phone has a standard capacity of 16 gigabytes (and is available with up to 64 gigabytes). Sixteen gigabytes translates to millions of pages of text, thousands of pictures, or hundreds of videos. See Kerr, supra, at 404; Brief for Center for Democracy & Technol-ogy et al. as Amici Curiae 7\u20138. Cell phones couple that capacity with the ability to store many different types of information: Even the most basic phones that sell for less than $20 might hold photographs, picture messages, text messages, Internet browsing history, a calendar, a thousand-entry phone book, and so on. See id., at 30; United States v. Flores-Lopez, 670 F. 3d 803, 806 (CA7 2012). We expect that the gulf between physical practicability and digital capacity will only continue to widen in the future.\n\nThe storage capacity of cell phones has several interrelated consequences for privacy. First, a cell phone collects in one place many distinct types of information\u2014an address, a note, a prescription, a bank statement, a video\u2014that reveal much more in combination than any isolated record. Second, a cell phone\u2019s capacity allows even just one type of information to convey far more than previously possible. The sum of an individual\u2019s private life can be reconstructed through a thousand photographs labeled with dates, locations, and descriptions; the same cannot be said of a photograph or two of loved ones tucked into a wallet. Third, the data on a phone can date back to the purchase of the phone, or even earlier. A person might carry in his pocket a slip of paper reminding him to call Mr. Jones; he would not carry a record of all his communications with Mr. Jones for the past several months, as would routinely be kept on a phone. 1\n\nFinally, there is an element of pervasiveness that characterizes cell phones but not physical records. Prior to the digital age, people did not typically carry a cache of sensitive personal information with them as they went about their day. Now it is the person who is not carrying a cell phone, with all that it contains, who is the exception. According to one poll, nearly three-quarters of smart phone users report being within five feet of their phones most of the time, with 12% admitting that they even use their phones in the shower. See Harris Interactive, 2013 Mobile Consumer Habits Study (June 2013). A decade ago police officers searching an arrestee might have occasionally stumbled across a highly personal item such as a diary. See, e.g., United States v. Frankenberry, 387 F. 2d 337 (CA2 1967) (per curiam). But those discoveries were likely to be few and far between. Today, by contrast, it is no exaggeration to say that many of the more than 90% of American adults who own a cell phone keep on their person a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives\u2014from the mundane to the intimate. See Ontario v. Quon, 560 U. S. 746, 760 (2010) . Allowing the police to scrutinize such records on a routine basis is quite different from allowing them to search a personal item or two in the occasional case.\n\nAlthough the data stored on a cell phone is distinguished from physical records by quantity alone, certain types of data are also qualitatively different. An Internet search and browsing history, for example, can be found on an Internet-enabled phone and could reveal an individual\u2019s private interests or concerns\u2014perhaps a search for certain symptoms of disease, coupled with frequent visits to WebMD. Data on a cell phone can also reveal where a person has been. Historic location information is a stand-ard feature on many smart phones and can reconstruct someone\u2019s specific movements down to the minute, not only around town but also within a particular building. See United States v. Jones, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3) (\u201cGPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person\u2019s public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.\u201d).\n\nMobile application software on a cell phone, or \u201capps,\u201d offer a range of tools for managing detailed information about all aspects of a person\u2019s life. There are apps for Democratic Party news and Republican Party news; apps for alcohol, drug, and gambling addictions; apps for sharing prayer requests; apps for tracking pregnancy symptoms; apps for planning your budget; apps for every conceivable hobby or pastime; apps for improving your romantic life. There are popular apps for buying or selling just about anything, and the records of such transactions may be accessible on the phone indefinitely. There are over a million apps available in each of the two major app stores; the phrase \u201cthere\u2019s an app for that\u201d is now part of the popular lexicon. The average smart phone user has installed 33 apps, which together can form a revealing montage of the user\u2019s life. See Brief for Electronic Privacy Information Center as Amicus Curiae in No. 13\u2013132, p. 9.\n\nIn 1926, Learned Hand observed (in an opinion later quoted in Chimel) that it is \u201ca totally different thing to search a man\u2019s pockets and use against him what they contain, from ransacking his house for everything which may incriminate him.\u201d United States v. Kirschenblatt, 16 F. 2d 202, 203 (CA2). If his pockets contain a cell phone, however, that is no longer true. Indeed, a cell phone search would typically expose to the government far more than the most exhaustive search of a house: A phone not only contains in digital form many sensitive records previ-ously found in the home; it also contains a broad array of private information never found in a home in any form\u2014unless the phone is.\n\n2\n\nTo further complicate the scope of the privacy interests at stake, the data a user views on many modern cell phones may not in fact be stored on the device itself. Treating a cell phone as a container whose contents may be searched incident to an arrest is a bit strained as an initial matter. See New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 460, n. 4 (1981) (describing a \u201ccontainer\u201d as \u201cany object capable of holding another object\u201d). But the analogy crumbles entirely when a cell phone is used to access data located elsewhere, at the tap of a screen. That is what cell phones, with increasing frequency, are designed to do by taking advantage of \u201ccloud computing.\u201d Cloud computing is the capacity of Internet-connected devices to display data stored on remote servers rather than on the device itself. Cell phone users often may not know whether particular information is stored on the device or in the cloud, and it generally makes little difference. See Brief for Electronic Privacy Information Center in No. 13\u2013132, at 12\u201314, 20. Moreover, the same type of data may be stored locally on the device for one user and in the cloud for another.\n\nThe United States concedes that the search incident to arrest exception may not be stretched to cover a search of files accessed remotely\u2014that is, a search of files stored in the cloud. See Brief for United States in No. 13\u2013212, at 43\u201344. Such a search would be like finding a key in a suspect\u2019s pocket and arguing that it allowed law enforcement to unlock and search a house. But officers searching a phone\u2019s data would not typically know whether the information they are viewing was stored locally at the time of the arrest or has been pulled from the cloud.\n\nAlthough the Government recognizes the problem, its proposed solutions are unclear. It suggests that officers could disconnect a phone from the network before searching the device\u2014the very solution whose feasibility it contested with respect to the threat of remote wiping. Compare Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13\u2013132, at 50\u201351, with Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13\u2013212, pp. 13\u201314. Alternatively, the Government proposes that law enforcement agencies \u201cdevelop protocols to address\u201d concerns raised by cloud computing. Reply Brief in No. 13\u2013212, pp. 14\u201315. Probably a good idea, but the Founders did not fight a revolution to gain the right to government agency protocols. The possibility that a search might extend well beyond papers and effects in the physical proximity of an arrestee is yet another reason that the privacy interests here dwarf those in Robinson.\n\nC\n\nApart from their arguments for a direct extension of Robinson, the United States and California offer various fallback options for permitting warrantless cell phone searches under certain circumstances. Each of the proposals is flawed and contravenes our general preference to provide clear guidance to law enforcement through categorical rules. \u201c[I]f police are to have workable rules, the balancing of the competing interests . . . \u2018must in large part be done on a categorical basis\u2014not in an ad hoc, case-by-case fashion by individual police officers.\u2019 \u201d Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 705, n. 19 (1981) (quoting Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200\u2013220 (1979) (White, J., concurring)).\n\nThe United States first proposes that the Gant standard be imported from the vehicle context, allowing a warrantless search of an arrestee\u2019s cell phone whenever it is reasonable to believe that the phone contains evidence of the crime of arrest. But Gant relied on \u201ccircumstances unique to the vehicle context\u201d to endorse a search solely for the purpose of gathering evidence. 556 U. S., at 343. Justice Scalia\u2019s Thornton opinion, on which Gant was based, explained that those unique circumstances are \u201ca reduced expectation of privacy\u201d and \u201cheightened law enforcement needs\u201d when it comes to motor vehicles. 541 U. S., at 631; see also Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S., at 303\u2013304. For reasons that we have explained, cell phone searches bear neither of those characteristics.\n\nAt any rate, a Gant standard would prove no practical limit at all when it comes to cell phone searches. In the vehicle context, Gant generally protects against searches for evidence of past crimes. See 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a77.1(d), at 709, and n. 191. In the cell phone context, however, it is reasonable to expect that incriminating information will be found on a phone regardless of when the crime occurred. Similarly, in the vehicle context Gant restricts broad searches resulting from minor crimes such as traffic violations. See id., \u00a77.1(d), at 713, and n. 204. That would not necessarily be true for cell phones. It would be a particularly inexperienced or unimaginative law enforcement officer who could not come up with sev-eral reasons to suppose evidence of just about any crime could be found on a cell phone. Even an individual pulled over for something as basic as speeding might well have locational data dispositive of guilt on his phone. An individual pulled over for reckless driving might have evidence on the phone that shows whether he was texting while driving. The sources of potential pertinent information are virtually unlimited, so applying the Gant standard to cell phones would in effect give \u201cpolice officers unbridled discretion to rummage at will among a person\u2019s private effects.\u201d 556 U. S., at 345.\n\nThe United States also proposes a rule that would restrict the scope of a cell phone search to those areas of the phone where an officer reasonably believes that infor-mation relevant to the crime, the arrestee\u2019s identity, or officer safety will be discovered. See Brief for United States in No. 13\u2013212, at 51\u201353. This approach would again impose few meaningful constraints on officers. The proposed categories would sweep in a great deal of information, and officers would not always be able to discern in advance what information would be found where.\n\nWe also reject the United States\u2019 final suggestion that officers should always be able to search a phone\u2019s call log, as they did in Wurie\u2019s case. The Government relies on Smith v. Maryland, 442 U. S. 735 (1979) , which held that no warrant was required to use a pen register at telephone company premises to identify numbers dialed by a particular caller. The Court in that case, however, concluded that the use of a pen register was not a \u201csearch\u201d at all under the Fourth Amendment. See id., at 745\u2013746. There is no dispute here that the officers engaged in a search of Wurie\u2019s cell phone. Moreover, call logs typically contain more than just phone numbers; they include any identifying information that an individual might add, such as the label \u201cmy house\u201d in Wurie\u2019s case.\n\nFinally, at oral argument California suggested a different limiting principle, under which officers could search cell phone data if they could have obtained the same information from a pre-digital counterpart. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 13\u2013132, at 38\u201343; see also Flores-Lopez, 670 F. 3d, at 807 (\u201cIf police are entitled to open a pocket diary to copy the owner\u2019s address, they should be entitled to turn on a cell phone to learn its number.\u201d). But the fact that a search in the pre-digital era could have turned up a photograph or two in a wallet does not justify a search of thousands of photos in a digital gallery. The fact that someone could have tucked a paper bank statement in a pocket does not justify a search of every bank statement from the last five years. And to make matters worse, such an analogue test would allow law enforcement to search a range of items contained on a phone, even though people would be unlikely to carry such a variety of information in physical form. In Riley\u2019s case, for example, it is implausible that he would have strolled around with video tapes, photo albums, and an address book all crammed into his pockets. But because each of those items has a pre-digital analogue, police under California\u2019s proposal would be able to search a phone for all of those items\u2014a significant diminution of privacy.\n\nIn addition, an analogue test would launch courts on a difficult line-drawing expedition to determine which digital files are comparable to physical records. Is an e-mail equivalent to a letter? Is a voicemail equivalent to a phone message slip? It is not clear how officers could make these kinds of decisions before conducting a search, or how courts would apply the proposed rule after the fact. An analogue test would \u201ckeep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.\u201d Sykes v. United States, 564 U. S. 1, ___ (2011) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7) (discussing the Court\u2019s analogue test under the Armed Career Criminal Act).\n\nIV\n\nWe cannot deny that our decision today will have an impact on the ability of law enforcement to combat crime. Cell phones have become important tools in facilitating coordination and communication among members of criminal enterprises, and can provide valuable incriminating information about dangerous criminals. Privacy comes at a cost.\n\nOur holding, of course, is not that the information on a cell phone is immune from search; it is instead that a warrant is generally required before such a search, even when a cell phone is seized incident to arrest. Our cases have historically recognized that the warrant requirement is \u201can important working part of our machinery of gov-ernment,\u201d not merely \u201can inconvenience to be somehow \u2018weighed\u2019 against the claims of police efficiency.\u201d Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, 481 (1971) . Recent technological advances similar to those discussed here have, in addition, made the process of obtaining a warrant itself more efficient. See McNeely, 569 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11\u201312); id., at ___ (Roberts, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (slip op., at 8) (describing jurisdiction where \u201cpolice officers can e-mail warrant requests to judges\u2019 iPads [and] judges have signed such warrants and e-mailed them back to officers in less than 15 minutes\u201d).\n\nMoreover, even though the search incident to arrest exception does not apply to cell phones, other case-specific exceptions may still justify a warrantless search of a particular phone. \u201cOne well-recognized exception applies when \u2018 \u201cthe exigencies of the situation\u201d make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 394 (1978) ). Such exigencies could include the need to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence in individual cases, to pursue a fleeing suspect, and to assist persons who are seriously injured or are threatened with imminent injury. 563 U. S., at ___. In Chadwick, for example, the Court held that the exception for searches incident to arrest did not justify a search of the trunk at issue, but noted that \u201cif officers have reason to believe that luggage contains some immediately dangerous instrumentality, such as explosives, it would be foolhardy to transport it to the station house without opening the luggage.\u201d 433 U. S., at 15, n. 9.\n\nIn light of the availability of the exigent circumstances exception, there is no reason to believe that law enforcement officers will not be able to address some of the more extreme hypotheticals that have been suggested: a suspect texting an accomplice who, it is feared, is preparing to detonate a bomb, or a child abductor who may have information about the child\u2019s location on his cell phone. The defendants here recognize\u2014indeed, they stress\u2014that such fact-specific threats may justify a warrantless search of cell phone data. See Reply Brief in No. 13\u2013132, at 8\u20139; Brief for Respondent in No. 13\u2013212, at 30, 41. The critical point is that, unlike the search incident to arrest exception, the exigent circumstances exception requires a court to examine whether an emergency justified a warrantless search in each particular case. See McNeely, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6). 2\n\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\nOur cases have recognized that the Fourth Amendment was the founding generation\u2019s response to the reviled \u201cgeneral warrants\u201d and \u201cwrits of assistance\u201d of the colonial era, which allowed British officers to rummage through homes in an unrestrained search for evidence of criminal activity. Opposition to such searches was in fact one of the driving forces behind the Revolution itself. In 1761, the patriot James Otis delivered a speech in Boston denouncing the use of writs of assistance. A young John Adams was there, and he would later write that \u201c[e]very man of a crowded audience appeared to me to go away, as I did, ready to take arms against writs of assistance.\u201d 10 Works of John Adams 247\u2013248 (C. Adams ed. 1856). According to Adams, Otis\u2019s speech was \u201cthe first scene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then and there the child Independence was born.\u201d Id., at 248 (quoted in Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 625 (1886) ).\n\nModern cell phones are not just another technological convenience. With all they contain and all they may reveal, they hold for many Americans \u201cthe privacies of life,\u201d Boyd, supra, at 630. The fact that technology now allows an individual to carry such information in his hand does not make the information any less worthy of the protection for which the Founders fought. Our answer to the question of what police must do before searching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly simple\u2014get a warrant.\n\nWe reverse the judgment of the California Court of Appeal in No. 13\u2013132 and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. We affirm the judgment of the First Circuit in No. 13\u2013212.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\nNotes\n1 Because the United States and California agree that these cases involve searches incident to arrest, these cases do not implicate the question whether the collection or inspection of aggregated digital information amounts to a search under other circumstances.\n\n2 In Wurie\u2019s case, for example, the dissenting First Circuit judge argued that exigent circumstances could have justified a search of Wurie\u2019s phone. See 728 F. 3d 1, 17 (2013) (opinion of Howard, J.) (discussing the repeated unanswered calls from \u201cmy house,\u201d the suspected location of a drug stash). But the majority concluded that the Government had not made an exigent circumstances argument. See id., at 1. The Government acknowledges the same in this Court. See Brief for United States in No. 13\u2013212, p. 28, n. 8.\nTOP\nConcurrence\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n_________________\n\nNos. 13\u2013132 and 13\u2013212\n\n_________________\n\nDAVID LEON RILEY, PETITIONER\n\n13\u2013132 v.\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\non writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of cali-fornia, fourth appellate district, division one\n\nUNITED STATES, PETITIONER\n\n13\u2013212 v.\n\nBRIMA WURIE\n\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit\n\n[June 25, 2014]\nJustice Alito, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n\nI agree with the Court that law enforcement officers, in conducting a lawful search incident to arrest, must generally obtain a warrant before searching information stored or accessible on a cell phone. I write separately to address two points.\n\nI\n\nA\n\nFirst, I am not convinced at this time that the ancient rule on searches incident to arrest is based exclusively (or even primarily) on the need to protect the safety of arresting officers and the need to prevent the destruction of evidence. Cf. ante, at 9. This rule antedates the adoption of the Fourth Amendment by at least a century. See T. Clancy, The Fourth Amendment: Its History and Interpretation 340 (2008); T. Taylor, Two Studies in Constitutional Interpretation 28 (1969); Amar, Fourth Amendment First Principles, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 757, 764 (1994). In Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 392 (1914) , we held that the Fourth Amendment did not disturb this rule. See also Taylor, supra, at 45; Stuntz, The Substantive Origins of Criminal Procedure, 105 Yale L. J. 393, 401 (1995) (\u201cThe power to search incident to arrest\u2014a search of the arrested suspect\u2019s person . . .\u2014was well established in the mid-eighteenth century, and nothing in . . . the Fourth Amendment changed that\u201d). And neither in Weeks nor in any of the authorities discussing the old common-law rule have I found any suggestion that it was based exclusively or primarily on the need to protect arresting officers or to prevent the destruction of evidence.\n\nOn the contrary, when pre-Weeks authorities discussed the basis for the rule, what was mentioned was the need to obtain probative evidence. For example, an 1839 case stated that \u201cit is clear, and beyond doubt, that . . . constables . . . are entitled, upon a lawful arrest by them of one charged with treason or felony, to take and detain prop-erty found in his possession which will form material evi-dence in his prosecution for that crime.\u201d See Dillon v. O\u2019Brien, 16 Cox Crim. Cas. 245, 249\u2013251 (1887) (citing Regina, v. Frost, 9 Car. & P. 129, 173 Eng. Rep. 771)). The court noted that the origins of that rule \u201cderiv[e] from the interest which the State has in a person guilty (or reasonably believed to be guilty) of a crime being brought to justice, and in a prosecution, once commenced, being determined in due course of law.\u201d 16 Cox Crim. Cas., at 249\u2013250. See also Holker v. Hennessey, 141 Mo. 527, 537\u2013540, 42 S. W. 1090, 1093 (1897).\n\nTwo 19th-century treatises that this Court has previ-ously cited in connection with the origin of the search-incident-to-arrest rule, see Weeks, supra, at 392, suggest the same rationale. See F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice \u00a760, p. 45 (8th ed. 1880) (\u201cThose arresting a defendant are bound to take from his person any articles which may be of use as proof in the trial of the offense with which the defendant is charged\u201d); J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure \u00a7\u00a7210\u2013212, p. 127 (2d ed. 1872) (if an arresting officer finds \u201cabout the prisoner\u2019s person, or otherwise in his possession, either goods or moneys which there is reason to believe are connected with the supposed crime as its fruits, or as the instruments with which it was committed, or as directly furnishing evidence relating to the transaction, he may take the same, and hold them to be disposed of as the court may direct\u201d).\n\nWhat ultimately convinces me that the rule is not closely linked to the need for officer safety and evidence preser-vation is that these rationales fail to explain the rule\u2019s well-recognized scope. It has long been accepted that written items found on the person of an arrestee may be examined and used at trial. 1 * But once these items are taken away from an arrestee (something that obviously must be done before the items are read), there is no risk that the arrestee will destroy them. Nor is there any risk that leaving these items unread will endanger the arresting officers.\n\nThe idea that officer safety and the preservation of evidence are the sole reasons for allowing a warrantless search incident to arrest appears to derive from the Court\u2019s reasoning in Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969) , a case that involved the lawfulness of a search of the scene of an arrest, not the person of an arrestee. As I have explained, Chimel\u2019s reasoning is questionable, see Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. 332\u2013363 (2009) (Alito, J., dissenting), and I think it is a mistake to allow that reasoning to affect cases like these that concern the search of the person of arrestees.\n\nB\n\nDespite my view on the point discussed above, I agree that we should not mechanically apply the rule used in the predigital era to the search of a cell phone. Many cell phones now in use are capable of storing and accessing a quantity of information, some highly personal, that no person would ever have had on his person in hard-copy form. This calls for a new balancing of law enforcement and privacy interests.\n\nThe Court strikes this balance in favor of privacy interests with respect to all cell phones and all information found in them, and this approach leads to anomalies. For example, the Court\u2019s broad holding favors information in digital form over information in hard-copy form. Suppose that two suspects are arrested. Suspect number one has in his pocket a monthly bill for his land-line phone, and the bill lists an incriminating call to a long-distance number. He also has in his a wallet a few snapshots, and one of these is incriminating. Suspect number two has in his pocket a cell phone, the call log of which shows a call to the same incriminating number. In addition, a number of photos are stored in the memory of the cell phone, and one of these is incriminating. Under established law, the police may seize and examine the phone bill and the snapshots in the wallet without obtaining a warrant, but under the Court\u2019s holding today, the information stored in the cell phone is out.\n\nWhile the Court\u2019s approach leads to anomalies, I do not see a workable alternative. Law enforcement officers need clear rules regarding searches incident to arrest, and it would take many cases and many years for the courts to develop more nuanced rules. And during that time, the nature of the electronic devices that ordinary Americans carry on their persons would continue to change.\n\nII\n\nThis brings me to my second point. While I agree with the holding of the Court, I would reconsider the question presented here if either Congress or state legislatures, after assessing the legitimate needs of law enforcement and the privacy interests of cell phone owners, enact legislation that draws reasonable distinctions based on categories of information or perhaps other variables.\n\nThe regulation of electronic surveillance provides an instructive example. After this Court held that electronic surveillance constitutes a search even when no property interest is invaded, see Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347\u2013359 (1967), Congress responded by enacting Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 82Stat. 211. See also 18 U. S. C. \u00a72510 et seq. Since that time, electronic surveillance has been governed primarily, not by decisions of this Court, but by the stat-ute, which authorizes but imposes detailed restrictions on electronic surveillance. See ibid.\n\nModern cell phones are of great value for both lawful and unlawful purposes. They can be used in committing many serious crimes, and they present new and difficult law enforcement problems. See Brief for United States in No. 13\u2013212, pp. 2\u20133. At the same time, because of the role that these devices have come to play in contemporary life, searching their contents implicates very sensitive privacy interests that this Court is poorly positioned to understand and evaluate. Many forms of modern technology are making it easier and easier for both government and private entities to amass a wealth of information about the lives of ordinary Americans, and at the same time, many ordinary Americans are choosing to make public much information that was seldom revealed to outsiders just a few decades ago.\n\nIn light of these developments, it would be very unfortunate if privacy protection in the 21st century were left primarily to the federal courts using the blunt instrument of the Fourth Amendment. Legislatures, elected by the people, are in a better position than we are to assess and respond to the changes that have already occurred and those that almost certainly will take place in the future.\n\nNotes\n1* Cf.

Sharpe, Deputy, for respondent.\n\nGUY, J.\n\nJoseph Riley was convicted of three counts of computer trespass and four counts of possession of a stolen access device after he used his home computer to obtain long-distance telephone access codes from telephone company computers. We hold that the search warrant used to obtain the physical evidence underlying most of Riley's convictions was invalid, and we therefore reverse those convictions. We affirm the remaining convictions, which are based on evidence independent from the invalid search warrant.\n\nFACTS\n\nNorthwest Telco Corporation (Telco) is a company that provides long-distance telephone service. Telco's customers dial a publicly available general access number, then enter an individualized 6-digit access code and the long-distance number they wish to call. A computer at Telco's central location then places the call and charges it to the account corresponding to the entered 6-digit code.\n\nOn January 9, 1990, Cal Edwards, director of engineering at Telco, observed that Telco's general access number was being dialed at regular intervals of approximately 40 seconds. After each dialing, a different 6-digit number was entered, followed by a certain long-distance number. Edwards observed similar activity on January 10, between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. From his past experience, Edwards recognized this activity as characteristic of that of a \"computer hacker\" attempting to obtain the individualized 6-digit access codes of Telco's customers. Edwards surmised that the hacker was using a computer and modem to dial Telco's general access number, a randomly selected 6-digit number, and a long-distance number. Then, by recording which 6-digit numbers enabled the *26 long-distance call to be put through successfully, the hacker was able to obtain the valid individual access codes of Telco's customers. The hacker could then use those codes fraudulently to make long-distance calls that would be charged improperly to Telco's paying customers.\n\nOn January 11, Edwards contacted Toni Ames, a U S West security investigator, and requested her assistance in exposing the hacker. In response, Ames established a line trap, which is a device that traces telephone calls to their source. By 3 p.m., Ames had traced the repeated dialing to the home of Joseph Riley in Silverdale, Washington. The dialing continued until 6 a.m. on January 12.\n\nAmes contacted the Kitsap County Prosecutor's office on January 12, 1990, and was directed to Investigator Richard Kitchen. Kitchen filed an affidavit for a search warrant after interviewing both Ames and Edwards. The affidavit stated that hackers program computers to conduct the repeated dialing of random numbers and, after discovering valid codes, often transfer them to notebooks, ledgers, or lists. Because the telephone company's system that processes long-distance calls is a computer \"switch\", the crime listed in the affidavit was computer trespass. That day, Kitchen obtained a search warrant authorizing the seizure of\n\nany fruits, instrumentalities and/or evidence of a crime, to-wit: notes, records, lists, ledgers, information stored on hard or floppy discs, personal computers, modems, monitors, speed dialers, touchtone telephones, electronic calculator, electronic notebooks or any electronic recording device.\nThe warrant did not state the crime of computer trespass, or any other crime.\n\nOn January 16, Kitchen arrived at Riley's house with the search warrant. Prior to executing the search, Kitchen informed Riley of his rights, although Riley was not arrested. Kitchen then questioned Riley about the occupancy of the house to ascertain which occupant was responsible for the hacking. According to Kitchen, \"[Riley] stated that his children did not have access to the modem and that he was *27 the one that used the computer and modem.\" Verbatim Report of Proceedings, at 88. Riley then admitted having attempted to obtain Telco customer access codes. Riley told Kitchen that he had tried to obtain the access codes for 3 days in the past week, but that he was not certain of the specific dates. This was consistent with the telephone company's observation of hacking activity on January 9, 10 and 11. Riley is also reported to have said that had he been successful in discovering valid access codes, he might have used the codes to make personal long-distance telephone calls.\n\nEvidence discovered during the subsequent search included four stolen access codes, a computer program that conducted the rapid repeated dialing and entry of random 6-digit numbers, handwritten notes detailing Riley's hacking activity, and a how-to-hack manual.\n\nRiley was later charged with and convicted of two counts of computer trespass against Telco, one count of computer trespass against another long-distance telephone company, ITT Metromedia, and four counts of possession of a stolen access device. The conditions of Riley's sentence included that he not associate with hackers, communicate with computer bulletin board services, or possess a computer.\n\nRiley appealed, and we accepted certification from the Court of Appeals.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nI\n\nThe Search Warrant\n\n[1] We first consider whether the search warrant used to search Riley's home was invalid. The trial court ruled that it was valid, despite the fact that it neither specified what crimes were being investigated nor otherwise limited the scope of the search by reference to particular items to be seized. We disagree. A search warrant that fails to specify the crime under investigation without otherwise limiting the items that may be seized violates the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n*28 The Fourth Amendment mandates that warrants describe with particularity the things to be seized.[1]State v. Perrone, 119 Wash. 2d 538, 545,  834 P.2d 611 (1992). When the nature of the underlying offense precludes a descriptive itemization, generic classifications such as lists are acceptable. Perrone, at 547; United States v. Spilotro, 800 F.2d 959, 963 (9th Cir.1986). In such cases, the search must be circumscribed by reference to the crime under investigation; otherwise, the warrant will fail for lack of particularity. Spilotro, at 964. For example, in United States v. Cardwell, 680 F.2d 75, 77-78 (9th Cir.1982), the court declared overbroad and invalid a warrant allowing seizure of any items that were the \"fruits, instrumentalities and evidence\" of violations of the general tax evasion statute. In Center Art Galleries \u2014 Hawaii, Inc. v. United States, 875 F.2d 747, 750 (9th Cir.1989), a warrant authorizing the seizure of evidence of violations of federal criminal law that did not describe the specific crimes being investigated was declared illegal. In Spilotro, the court struck down as overbroad a warrant that permitted the seizure of evidence of a violation of any one of 13 federal statutes.\n\nIn the present case, the warrant used to search Riley's home permitted the seizure of broad categories of material and was not limited by reference to any specific criminal activity. We therefore hold that the warrant was overbroad and invalid.\n\n[2] The State contends that the warrant is valid because the executing officer, Investigator Kitchen, had personal knowledge of the crime being investigated. It is true that the executing officer's personal knowledge of the place to be searched may \"cure\" minor, technical defects in the warrant's place description. 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 4.5(a), at 209-10 (2d ed. 1987). For example, the officer's knowledge of the place to be searched will excuse the transposition of address numbers. State v. Smith, 39 Wn. App. *29 642, 648-49, 694 P.2d 660 (1984), review denied, 103 Wash. 2d 1034 (1985). However, where the inadequacy arises not in the warrant's description of the place to be searched but rather in the things to be seized, the officer's personal knowledge of the crime may not cure the defect. See generally 2 W. LaFave \u00a7\u00a7 4.5-4.6 (discussing the particularity requirement in relation to a warrant's description of the places to be searched and the things to be seized). This is so because the purpose of a warrant is not only to limit the executing officer's discretion, but to inform the person subject to the search what items the officer may seize. United States v. Hayes, 794 F.2d 1348, 1355 (9th Cir.1986).\n\n[3] For the same reason, the State's assertion that the search was not executed overbroadly is irrelevant. Because the person whose home is searched has the right to know what items may be seized, an overbroad warrant is invalid whether or not the executing officer abused his discretion. See In re Lafayette Academy, Inc., 610 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1979).\n\n[4] The State also contends that the warrant's overbreadth is cured because the affidavit limited the search to evidence of the particular crime of computer trespass. However, an affidavit may only cure an overbroad warrant where the affidavit and the search warrant are physically attached, and the warrant expressly refers to the affidavit and incorporates it with \"suitable words of reference\". Bloom v. State, 283 So. 2d 134, 136 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1973). See generally 2 W. LaFave \u00a7 4.6(a), at 241 (discussing question whether description in affidavit can save defective description in warrant). If the affidavit is not attached to the warrant and expressly incorporated therein, it may not cure generalities in the warrant even if some of the executing officers have copies of the affidavit. Center Art Galleries, at 750; Spilotro, at 967; State v. Kelley, 52 Wash. App. 581, 762 P.2d 20 (1988) (search of buildings listed in affidavit but not warrant held impermissible because affidavit was not attached and not expressly incorporated); United States v. Strand, 761 F.2d 449, 453-54 (8th Cir.1985) (affidavit attached to warrant could not cure *30 warrant's lack of particularity because of improper words of incorporation).\n\nThe affidavit for the Riley warrant was not attached to the search warrant or incorporated in the warrant by reference. Therefore, although the affidavit mentioned \"computer trespass\" as the crime under investigation, it cannot validate the overbroad warrant.\n\n[5] The State further argues that even if the warrant's defects are not cured by the executing officer's personal knowledge of the crime, the \"good faith\" exception to the exclusionary rule applies, rendering the fruits of the search admissible at trial. We reject this argument. This court has neither accepted nor rejected the good faith exception under the Washington State Constitution. State v. Canady, 116 Wash. 2d 853, 857-58, 809 P.2d 203 (1991). See also State v. Crawley, 61 Wash. App. 29, 35, 808 P.2d 773, review denied, 117 Wash. 2d 1009 (1991); State v. Kelley, 52 Wash. App. 581, 587 n. 2,  762 P.2d 20 (1988). The State did not raise the good faith issue prior to appeal. We will not consider adopting the exception when the issue has not been briefed or argued below. Canady, at 857.\n\n[6] We hold that the search warrant relied upon to search Riley's home is invalid. Therefore the primary fruits of the search must be suppressed. Because Riley's convictions of four counts of possession of stolen property and one count of computer trespass against ITT Metromedia are supported solely by physical evidence obtained from the search, we reverse those convictions.\n\nII\n\nRiley's Confessions\n\nWe next consider Riley's convictions of two counts of computer trespass against Telco. We affirm the convictions.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, we consider Riley's argument that these convictions, like his others, must be reversed because they are based upon evidence obtained by use of the illegal search warrant. That evidence includes a number of incriminating statements Riley made to Investigator Kitchen *31 to the effect that Riley had on three separate days dialed Telco's general access number using his computer and modem in an attempt to obtain customer calling card codes. The State contends the computer trespass convictions can be sustained because the incriminating statements were made independently of the execution of the warrant.\n\n[7, 8] Riley raises his Fourth Amendment argument against the admission of the incriminating statements for the first time on appeal.[2] Arguments not raised in the trial court generally will not be considered on appeal. Van Vonno v. Hertz Corp., 120 Wash. 2d 416, 427, 841 P.2d 1244 (1992). Moreover, although RAP 2.5(a) permits a party to raise for the first time on appeal a \"manifest error affecting a constitutional right\", RAP 2.5(a) does not mandate appellate review of a newly raised argument where the facts necessary for its adjudication are not in the record and therefore where the error is not \"manifest\". Here, the record is unclear as to whether any or all of Riley's incriminating statements were the product of the invalid search warrant. In particular, the record is unclear whether Riley made incriminating statements prior to being told the investigating officer had a search warrant. Because we lack the needed record for review, we decline to consider whether the Fourth Amendment requires exclusion of Riley's incriminating statements. See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471,  9 L. Ed. 2d 441, 83 S. Ct. 407 (1963) (incriminating statements that are indirect fruits of an illegal search are inadmissible when they *32 bear a sufficiently close relationship to the underlying illegality); Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 603-04, 45 L. Ed. 2d 416, 95 S. Ct. 2254 (1975) (listing factors to guide determination whether underlying illegality taints incriminating statements); New York v. Harris, 495 U.S. 14, 19, 109 L. Ed. 2d 13,  110 S. Ct. 1640 (1990) (attenuation analysis required only where evidence is somehow product of illegal governmental activity); see generally Annot., \"Fruit of the Poisonous Tree\" Doctrine Excluding Evidence Derived From Information Gained in Illegal Search, 43 A.L.R. 3d 385, 397 (1972) (explaining that \"fruits\" doctrine applies to confession obtained via an illegal search).\n\n[9] Thus, we shall assume Riley's admission that he had dialed Telco's general access number in an attempt to obtain customer calling card codes was properly admitted against him, despite the invalidity of the search warrant used in the search of Riley's home subsequent to the time he made that admission. A confession alone, however, will not sustain a conviction unless it is corroborated by independent proof sufficient to establish the corpus delicti of the crime. State v. Ryan, 103 Wash. 2d 165, 178, 691 P.2d 197 (1984); State v. Cunningham, 23 Wash. App. 826, 855-56, 598 P.2d 756 (1979). \"The independent evidence need not ... establish the corpus delicti beyond a reasonable doubt, or even by a preponderance of the proof.\" State v. Meyer, 37 Wash. 2d 759, 763, 226 P.2d 204 (1951). The evidence need only \"support a logical and reasonable deduction\" that the crime occurred. State v. Hamrick, 19 Wash. App. 417, 419, 576 P.2d 912 (1978).\n\nHere, there are two pieces of evidence to corroborate Riley's admission: Cal Edwards's observation of hacking activity on January 10 and 11, and U S West's tracing of the hacking to Riley's home on January 11. When Riley's admission and the independent corroborating evidence are considered together, there is sufficient evidence to sustain Riley's conviction of the two counts of computer trespass against Telco. We therefore affirm Riley's conviction of these two counts.\n\n*33 III\n\nUse of Line Trap\n\nRiley raises an argument against the admission of one of the above pieces of corroborating evidence. In particular, he objects that the line trap placed by U S West, which traced the hacking activity to Riley's home, recorded a \"private communication\" in violation of RCW 9.73.030(1)(a). Therefore, Riley argues, the information derived from the line trap may not be used in any criminal case against him pursuant to RCW 9.73.050.[3]\n\n[10] We reject Riley's argument. RCW 9.73.030(1)(a) provides in part that\n\nit shall be unlawful for any ... corporation ... to intercept, or record any:\n(a) Private communication transmitted by telephone... between two or more individuals ... by any device electronic or otherwise designed to record and/or transmit said communication regardless how such device is powered or actuated, without first obtaining the consent of all the participants in the communication[.]\nBecause RCW 9.73 does not define \"private communication\", courts must give the term its ordinary and usual meaning. Kadoranian v. Bellingham Police Dep't, 119 Wash. 2d 178, 18990, 829 P.2d 1061 (1992); State v. Forrester, 21 Wash. App. 855, 861, 587 P.2d 179 (1978), review denied, 92 Wash. 2d 1006 (1979). The ordinary meaning of \"communication\" is \"the act ... of imparting or transmitting\" or \"facts or information communicated\". Webster's Third New International Dictionary 460 (1986).\n\n[11] Here, the \"line trap\" traced the hacking activity to, and discovered nothing more than, Riley's telephone number. A telephone number, unless it is itself communicated, *34 does not constitute a \"communication\". Therefore, discovering Riley's telephone number via a tracer does not implicate RCW 9.73.030(1)(a).\n\nRiley urges that State v. Gunwall, 106 Wash. 2d 54, 720 P.2d 808, 76 A.L.R. 4th 517 (1986) dictates a contrary determination. We disagree. In Gunwall, this court held that a pen register records a \"private communication\" under RCW 9.73.106 Wn.2d at 69. A pen register is a device that \"identif[ies] all local and long distance numbers dialed, whether the call is completed or not.\" Gunwall, at 63. Although a pen register does not intercept spoken words, it does record an exchange of information \u2014 the dialing from one telephone number to another. A pen register is thus \"comparable in impact to electronic eavesdropping devices in that it ... may affect other persons and can involve multiple invasions of privacy\". Gunwall, at 69. In contrast, all that is learned from a tracer is the telephone number of one party, the party dialing. A pen register may therefore be reasonably viewed as recording a \"private communication\", whereas a tracer may not.\n\n[12] Assuming, arguendo, that a telephone number constitutes a \"private communication\" under RCW 9.73.030, the information obtained from the tracer would still be admissible to corroborate Riley's confessions. RCW 9.73.070 exempts acts performed \"in the... operations of the common carrier's communications services, facilities, or equipment or incident to the use of such services, facilities or equipment\" from the provisions of RCW 9.73. Telephone companies must address hacking during their operation and maintenance. Thus, tracing hacking activity constitutes an act performed in the \"operations of the common carrier's communications services\".\n\nWe hold that RCW 9.73 does not apply because no \"private communication\" was recorded via a line trap; and that even if RCW 9.73 did apply, U S West had the authority to establish a line trap pursuant to RCW 9.73.070.[4] Therefore, the information obtained from U S West's tracer may be *35 used to corroborate Riley's admission of having committed the crime of computer trespass against Telco.\n\nIV\n\nDefinition of Computer Trespass\n\nRiley also contends that his convictions of computer trespass against Telco must be reversed because his conduct \u2014 repeatedly dialing Telco's general access number and entering random 6-digit numbers in an attempt to discover access codes belonging to others \u2014 does not satisfy the statutory definition of computer trespass. We disagree.\n\n[13, 14] RCW 9A.52.110 provides in relevant part that\n\n[a] person is guilty of computer trespass in the first degree if the person, without authorization, intentionally gains access to a computer system or electronic data base of another....\nRiley contends the telephone company's long-distance switch is not a \"computer\" under RCW 9A.52.110. We reject this contention. The trial court explicitly found that the switch is a computer. This finding was based on unrebutted expert testimony. A trial court's findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal when they are supported by undisputed evidence. Leonard v. Washington Employers, Inc., 77 Wash. 2d 271, 272, 461 P.2d 538 (1969).\n\nRiley also argues that acts accomplished by simply dialing the telephone are not encompassed within the statutorily defined crime of computer trespass, and are merely the equivalent of placing a telephone call. He contends he is not guilty of computer trespass because he did not enter, read, insert, or copy data from the telephone system's computer switch. Instead, he argues, RCW 9.26A.110, dealing with telephone fraud, is more appropriately applied.\n\nRiley's acts were not equivalent to placing a telephone call. He used his home computer to dial Telco's general access number and enter random 6-digit numbers representing customer access codes every 40 seconds for several hours at a time. Moreover, RCW 9A.52.110 criminalizes the unauthorized, intentional \"access\" of a computer system. The term \"access\" is defined under RCW 9A.52.010(6) as \"to approach ... or *36 otherwise make use of any resources of a computer, directly or by electronic means.\" Riley's repeated attempts to discover access codes by sequentially entering random 6-digit numbers constitute \"approach[ing]\" or \"otherwise mak[ing] use of any resources of a computer\". The switch is a computer. Long-distance calls are processed through the switch. Riley was approaching the switch each time he entered the general access number, followed by a random 6-digit number representing a customer access code, and a destination number. Therefore, Riley's conduct satisfied the statutory definition of \"access\" and so was properly treated as computer trespass.[5]\n\nV\n\nSentence\n\nRiley challenges three conditions of his sentence: the prohibitions against Riley owning a computer, associating with other computer hackers, and communicating with computer bulletin boards. He argues that these conditions are not directly crime related, in violation of RCW 9.94A.120(5) and RCW 9.94A.030(7), (11). We disagree and hold that all the conditions the trial court imposed are reasonably related to Riley's convictions of two counts of computer trespass against Telco.\n\nRiley was sentenced pursuant to RCW 9.94A.120(5) which provides that a first-time offender may be sentenced to \"up to two years of community supervision, which [includes the imposition of] crime-related prohibitions\". Under RCW 9.94A.030(11), a crime-related prohibition is defined as \"an order of a court prohibiting conduct that directly relates to the circumstances of the crime for which the offender has been convicted\". The philosophy underlying the \"crime-related\" provision is that \"[p]ersons may be punished for their crimes and they may be prohibited from doing things which are directly related to their crimes, but they may not be coerced *37 into doing things which are believed will rehabilitate them.\" D. Boerner, Sentencing in Washington \u00a7 4.5, at 4-7 (1985).[6]See also State v. Barnes, 117 Wash. 2d 701, 709-10, 818 P.2d 1088 (1991); In re Mota, 114 Wash. 2d 465, 476, 788 P.2d 538 (1990).\n\n[15, 16] The main concern that arises when reviewing crime-related prohibitions is thus the prevention of coerced rehabilitation. See generally D. Boerner \u00a7 4.5, at 4-6 through 4-7. Otherwise, the assignment of crime-related prohibitions has \"traditionally been left to the discretion of the sentencing judge.\" State v. Parramore, 53 Wash. App. 527, 530, 768 P.2d 530 (1989) (quoting D. Boerner \u00a7 4.5, at 4-7). Thus, a sentence will be reversed only if it is \"manifestly unreasonable\" such that \"no reasonable man would take the view adopted by the trial court.\" State v. Blight, 89 Wash. 2d 38, 41, 569 P.2d 1129 (1977).\n\n[17] Here, proscribing Riley from possessing a computer is clearly permissible under RCW 9.94A.030(7), (11). We find unpersuasive Riley's argument that this portion of his sentence is not crime related because he cannot commit computer trespass without a modem. Allowing Riley to possess a computer would facilitate his commission of computer trespass in the future. Further, given that punishment is a main goal of sentences imposed pursuant to RCW 9.94A.030(7), (11), prohibiting Riley from possessing a computer for the length of his sentence is a reasonable punishment for a self-proclaimed computer hacker.\n\nProhibiting Riley from associating with other computer hackers is also reasonable. Limitations upon fundamental rights are permissible, provided they are imposed sensitively. United States v. Consuelo-Gonzalez, 521 F.2d 259, 265 (9th Cir.1975). \"[The convict's] freedom of association may be restricted if reasonably necessary to accomplish the essential *38 needs of the state and public order.\" Malone v. United States, 502 F.2d 554, 556 (9th Cir.1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1124 (1975). The prohibition against Riley associating with other computer hackers is punitive and helps prevent Riley from further criminal conduct for the duration of his sentence. It is therefore not an unconstitutional restriction of Riley's freedom of association. The prohibition against Riley communicating with computer bulletin boards is also reasonably crime related as a means of discouraging his communication with other hackers.\n\nWe hold that the conditions of Riley's sentence were reasonably related to Riley's convictions of computer trespass. We therefore uphold the trial court's imposition of those conditions.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe reverse Riley's convictions for computer trespass against ITT Metromedia and possession of four stolen access devices because those convictions were supported solely by evidence illegally seized from Riley's home. Riley's convictions of two counts of computer trespass against Northwest Telco are independently supportable and are therefore affirmed.\n\nANDERSEN, C.J., and UTTER, BRACHTENBACH, DURHAM, SMITH, and JOHNSON, JJ., concur.\n\nReconsideration denied April 2, 1993.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] The Fourth Amendment provides that \"no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" (Italics ours.) U.S. Const. amend. 4.\n\n[2] Although an attempt to exclude the confessions appears in the trial record (Clerk's Papers, at 64), it is based on Fifth, rather than Fourth, Amendment grounds. Thus, instead of discussing the \"fruits\" doctrine, Riley disputed at trial the voluntariness of his statements. However, \"[v]oluntariness is a test of the admissibility of a confession under the common-law prohibition of compulsory self-incrimination.... It does not affect the issue here, the Fourth Amendment question of whether a confession is a `fruit of the poisonous tree.'\" State v. Byers, 88 Wash. 2d 1, 7, 559 P.2d 1334 (1977). Therefore, Riley's Fifth Amendment argument for the suppression of his confessions does not suffice as a substitute for the requisite Fourth Amendment argument. The record is not sufficiently developed factually for us to consider the issue; thus, we decline to speculate on what occurred.\n\n[3] Although the State asserts that Riley did not properly preserve this issue for appellate review, appellant assigned error to the \"warrantless line trap\" and alleged a violation of RCW 9.73 at the trial level. Brief of Appellant app. B, at 5. This is sufficient to preserve an issue for appellate review. See State v. Clark, 53 Wash. App. 120, 123, 765 P.2d 916 (1988) (an assignment of error, supported by argument and citation to authority, preserves a claimed error for appellate review), review denied, 112 Wash. 2d 1018 (1989).\n\n[4] We express no opinion as to whether RCW 9.73.030(2)(c), the anonymous or repeated telephone call exception to RCW 9.73.030(1)(a), applies to the tracing of hacking activity by a telephone company.\n\n[5] This interpretation of the statute does not criminalize repeated dialing of a busy telephone number because a computer trespass conviction requires an \"intent to commit another crime\". RCW 9A.52.110(1)(a). It is not disputed that Riley had such an intent.\n\n[6] Appellant correctly asserts that the first-time offender option (RCW 9.94A.120(5)) permits the imposition of rehabilitative sentencing conditions. See D. Boerner, Sentencing in Washington \u00a7 7.1 (1985); State v. Welty, 44 Wash. App. 281, 283, 726 P.2d 472, review denied, 107 Wash. 2d 1002 (1986). However, Riley contests only the crime-related portion of his sentence. The rehabilitation-oriented philosophy of RCW 9.94A.120(5) applies only to the \"other conditions\" imposed pursuant to subsection (5)(a) through (f), which Riley does not challenge.", "annotations":

(\"Hawaiian\"), alleging that Hawaiian viewed Konop's secure website without authorization, disclosed the contents of that website, and took other related actions in violation of the federal Wiretap Act, the Stored Communications Act, and the Railway Labor Act. Konop also alleged several state tort claims. The district court granted summary judgment against Konop on all claims, except his retaliation claim under the Railway Labor Act. On the retaliation claim, the district court entered judgment against Konop following a bench trial. Konop appeals the district court's judgement on all claims, except on those brought under state tort law.\n\n2\nOn January 8, 2001, we issued an opinion, reversing the district court's decision on Konop's claims under the Wiretap Act and the Stored Communications Act, and on several of his claims under the Railway Labor Act. Konop v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., 236 F.3d 1035 (9th Cir.2001). Hawaiian filed a petition for rehearing, which became moot when we withdrew our previous opinion. Konop v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., 262 F.3d 972 (9th Cir.2001). We now affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to Konop's Wiretap Act claims and his retaliation claim under the Railway Labor Act. We reverse the district court's judgment with respect to Konop's claims under the Stored Communications Act and his remaining claims under the Railway Labor Act.\n\nFACTS\n\n3\nKonop, a pilot for Hawaiian, created and maintained a website where he posted bulletins critical of his employer, its officers, and the incumbent union, Air Line Pilots Association (\"ALPA\"). Many of those criticisms related to Konop's opposition to labor concessions which Hawaiian sought from ALPA. Because ALPA supported the concessions, Konop, via his website, encouraged Hawaiian employees to consider alternative union representation.\n\n4\nKonop controlled access to his website by requiring visitors to log in with a user name and password. He created a list of people, mostly pilots and other employees of Hawaiian, who were eligible to access the website. Pilots Gene Wong and James Gardner were included on this list. Konop programmed the website to allow access when a person entered the name of an eligible person, created a password, and clicked the \"SUBMIT\" button on the screen, indicating acceptance of the terms and conditions of use. These terms and conditions prohibited any member of Hawaiian's management from viewing the website and prohibited users from disclosing the website's contents to anyone else.\n\n5\nIn December 1995, Hawaiian vice president James Davis asked Wong for permission to use Wong's name to access Konop's website. Wong agreed. Davis claimed he was concerned about untruthful allegations that he believed Konop was making on the website. Wong had not previously logged into the website to create an account. When Davis accessed the website using Wong's name, he presumably typed in Wong's name, created a password, and clicked the \"SUBMIT\" button indicating acceptance of the terms and conditions.\n\n6\nLater that day, Konop received a call from the union chairman of ALPA, Reno Morella.1 Morella told Konop that Hawaiian president Bruce Nobles had contacted him regarding the contents of Konop's website. Morella related that Nobles was upset by Konop's accusations that Nobles was suspected of fraud and by other disparaging statements published on the website. From this conversation with Morella, Konop believed Nobles had obtained the contents of his website and was threatening to sue Konop for defamation based on statements contained on the website.\n\n7\nAfter speaking with Morella, Konop took his website offline for the remainder of the day. He placed it back online the next morning, however, without knowing how Nobles had obtained the information discussed in the phone call. Konop claims to have learned only later from the examination of system logs that Davis had accessed the website using Wong's name.\n\n8\nIn the meantime, Davis continued to view the website using Wong's name. Later, Davis also logged in with the name of another pilot, Gardner, who had similarly consented to Davis' use of his name. Through April 1996, Konop claims that his records indicate that Davis logged in over twenty times as Wong, and that Gardner or Davis logged in at least fourteen more times as Gardner.\n\n9\nKonop filed suit alleging claims under the federal Wiretap Act, the Stored Communications Act, the Railway Labor Act, and state tort law, arising from Davis' viewing and use of Konop's secure website. Konop also alleged that Hawaiian placed him on medical suspension in retaliation for his opposition to the proposed labor concessions, in violation of the Railway Labor Act. The district court granted summary judgment to Hawaiian on all but the retaliatory suspension claim, and entered judgment against Konop on that claim after a short bench trial.\n\n10\nKonop appeals, arguing that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Hawaiian on his federal claims under the Wiretap Act, Stored Communications Act, and Railway Labor Act. In addition, Konop urges us to reverse the district court's judgment on the retaliation claim following the bench trial, because he claims the district court improperly quashed subpoenas for witnesses Konop sought to have testify at trial.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n11\nThe district court's grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Konop, we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law. Id.\n\n12\nI. Electronic Communications Privacy Act Claims\n\n13\nWe first turn to the difficult task of determining whether Hawaiian violated either the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2522 (2000) or the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2701-2711 (2000),2 when Davis accessed Konop's secure website. In 1986, Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), Pub.L. No. 99-508, 100 Stat. 1848, which was intended to afford privacy protection to electronic communications. Title I of the ECPA amended the federal Wiretap Act, which previously addressed only wire and oral communications, to \"address[] the interception of ... electronic communications.\" S.Rep. No. 99-541, at 3 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3557. Title II of the ECPA created the Stored Communications Act (SCA), which was designed to \"address[] access to stored wire and electronic communications and transactional records.\" Id.\n\n14\nAs we have previously observed, the intersection of these two statutes \"is a complex, often convoluted, area of the law.\" United States v. Smith, 155 F.3d 1051, 1055 (9th Cir.1998). In the present case, the difficulty is compounded by the fact that the ECPA was written prior to the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web. As a result, the existing statutory framework is ill-suited to address modern forms of communication like Konop's secure website. Courts have struggled to analyze problems involving modern technology within the confines of this statutory framework, often with unsatisfying results. See. e.g., Robert A. Pikowsky, Legal and Technological Issues Surrounding Privacy of Attorney Client Communication Via Email, Advocate, Oct. 2000, at 17-19 (discussing the uncertainty over email privacy caused by the ECPA and judicial interpretations thereof); Lieutenant Colonel LeEllen Coacher, Permitting Systems Protection Monitoring: When the Government Can Look and What It Can See, 46 A.F. L.Rev. 155, 171-74 (1999) (same); Tatsuya Akamine, Note, Proposal for a Fair Statutory Interpretation: E-mail Stored in a Service Provider Computer Is Subject to an Interception Under the Federal Wiretap Act, 7 J.L. Pol'y 519, 521-29, 561-68 (1999) (criticizing the judiciary's interpretation of the ECPA). We observe that until Congress brings the laws in line with modern technology, protection of the Internet and websites such as Konop's will remain a confusing and uncertain area of the law.\n\nA. The Internet and Secure Websites\n\n15\nThe Internet is an international network of interconnected computers that allows millions of people to communicate and exchange information. See Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844, 849-50, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874 (1997); In re DoubleClick Inc. Privacy Litig., 154 F. Supp. 2d 497, 501 (S.D.N.Y.2001). The World Wide Web, the best known category of communication over the Internet, consists of a vast number of electronic documents stored in different computers all over the world. Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. at 852, 117 S. Ct. 2329. Any person or organization with a computer connected to the Internet can \"publish\" information on the Web in the form of a \"web page\" or \"website.\" See id. at 853 & n. 9, 95 S. Ct. 2051. A website consists of electronic information stored by a hosting service computer or \"server.\" The owner of the website may pay a fee for this service. Each website has a unique domain name or web address (e.g., Amazon.com or Lycos.com), which corresponds to a specific location within the server where the electronic information comprising the website is stored. A person who wishes to view the website types the domain name into a computer connected to the Internet. This is essentially a request to the server to make an electronic copy of the website (or at least the first page or \"home page\") and send it to the user's computer. After this electronic information reaches the user's computer, it is downloaded for viewing on the user's screen. See generally Preston Gralla, How the Internet Works (1999).\n\n16\nWhile most websites are public, many, such as Konop's, are restricted. For instance, some websites are password-protected, require a social security number, or require the user to purchase access by entering a credit card number. See Reno, 521 U.S. at 852-53, 856, 117 S. Ct. 2329. The legislative history of the ECPA suggests that Congress wanted to protect electronic communications that are configured to be private, such as email and private electronic bulletin boards. See S.Rep. No. 99-541, at 35-36, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3599 (\"This provision [the SCA] addresses the growing problem of unauthorized persons deliberately gaining access to ... electronic or wire communications that are not intended to be available to the public.\"); H.R.Rep. No. 99-647 at 41, 62-63 (1986) (describing the Committee's understanding that the configuration of the electronic communications system would determine whether or not an electronic communication was readily accessible to the public). The nature of the Internet, however, is such that if a user enters the appropriate information (password, social security number, etc.), it is nearly impossible to verify the true identity of that user. Cf. Reno, 521 U.S. at 855-56, 117 S. Ct. 2329 (discussing the difficulty of verifying the age of a website user by requiring a credit card number or password).\n\n17\nWe are confronted with such a situation here. Although Konop took certain steps to restrict the access of Davis and other managers to the website,3 Davis was nevertheless able to access the website by entering the correct information, which was freely provided to Davis by individuals who were eligible to view the website.\n\nB. Wiretap Act\n\n18\nKonop argues that Davis' conduct constitutes an interception of an electronic communication in violation of the\n\n19\nWiretap Act. The Wiretap Act makes it an offense to \"intentionally intercept[] ... any wire, oral, or electronic communication.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(1)(a). We must therefore determine whether Konop's website is an \"electronic communication\" and, if so, whether Davis \"intercepted\" that communication.\n\n20\nAn \"electronic communication\" is defined as \"any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photooptical system.\" Id. \u00a7 2510(12). As discussed above, website owners such as Konop transmit electronic documents to servers, where the documents are stored. If a user wishes to view the website, the user requests that the server transmit a copy of the document to the user's computer. When the server sends the document to the user's computer for viewing, a transfer of information from the website owner to the user has occurred. Although the website owner's document does not go directly or immediately to the user, once a user accesses a website, information is transferred from the website owner to the user via one of the specified mediums. We therefore conclude that Konop's website fits the definition of \"electronic communication.\"\n\n21\nThe Wiretap Act, however, prohibits only \"interceptions\" of electronic communications. \"Intercept\" is defined as \"the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\" Id. \u00a7 2510(4). Standing alone, this definition would seem to suggest that an individual \"intercepts\" an electronic communication merely by \"acquiring\" its contents, regardless of when or under what circumstances the acquisition occurs. Courts, however, have clarified that Congress intended a narrower definition of \"intercept\" with regard to electronic communications.\n\n22\nIn Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service, 36 F.3d 457 (5th Cir.1994), the Fifth Circuit held that the government's acquisition of email messages stored on an electronic bulletin board system, but not yet retrieved by the intended recipients, was not an \"interception\" under the Wiretap Act. The court observed that, prior to the enactment of the ECPA, the word \"intercept\" had been interpreted to mean the acquisition of a communication contemporaneous with transmission. Id. at 460 (citing United States v. Turk, 526 F.2d 654, 658 (5th Cir.1976)). The court further observed that Congress, in passing the ECPA, intended to retain the previous definition of \"intercept\" with respect to wire and oral communications,4 while amending the Wiretap Act to cover interceptions of electronic communications. See Steve Jackson Games, 36 F.3d at 462; S.Rep. No. 99-541, at 13; H.R.Rep. No. 99-647, at 34. The court reasoned, however, that the word \"intercept\" could not describe the exact same conduct with respect to wire and electronic communications, because wire and electronic communications were defined differently in the statute. Specifically, the term \"wire communication\" was defined to include storage of the communication, while \"electronic communication\" was not.5 The court concluded that this textual difference evidenced Congress' understanding that, although one could \"intercept\" a wire communication in storage, one could not \"intercept\" an electronic communication in storage:\n\n23\nCritical to the issue before us is the fact that, unlike the definition of \"wire communication,\" the definition of \"electronic communication\" does not include electronic storage of such communications.... Congress' use of the word \"transfer\" in the definition of \"electronic communication,\" and its omission in that definition of the phrase \"any electronic storage of such communication\" ... reflects that Congress did not intend for \"intercept\" to apply to \"electronic communications\" when those communications are in \"electronic storage.\"\n\n24\nSteve Jackson Games, 36 F.3d at 461-62; Wesley Coll. v. Pitts, 974 F. Supp. 375, 386 (D.Del.1997) (\"[B]y including the electronic storage of wire communications within the definition of such communications but declining to do the same for electronic communications ... Congress sufficiently evinced its intent to make acquisitions of electronic communications unlawful under the Wiretap Act only if they occur contemporaneously with their transmissions.\"), aff'd, 172 F.3d 861 (3d Cir.1998); United States v. Reyes, 922 F. Supp. 818, 836 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (\"Taken together, the definitions thus imply a requirement that the acquisition of [electronic communications] be simultaneous with the original transmission of the data.\"); Bohach v. City of Reno, 932 F. Supp. 1232, 1236-37 (D.Nev. 1996) (requiring acquisition during transmission). The Steve Jackson Court further noted that the ECPA was deliberately structured to afford electronic communications in storage less protection than other forms of communication. See Steve Jackson Games, 36 F.3d at 462-64.\n\n25\nThe Ninth Circuit endorsed the reasoning of Steve Jackson Games in United States v. Smith, 155 F.3d at 1051. The question presented in Smith was whether the Wiretap Act covered wire communications in storage, such as voice mail messages, or just wire communications in transmission, such as ongoing telephone conversations. Relying on the same textual distinction as the Fifth Circuit in Steve Jackson Games, we concluded that wire communications in storage could be \"intercepted\" under the Wiretap Act. We found that Congress' inclusion of storage in the definition of \"wire communication\" militated in favor of a broad definition of the term \"intercept\" with respect to wire communications, one that included acquisition of a communication subsequent to transmission. We further observed that, with respect to wire communications only, the prior definition of \"intercept\" \u2014 acquisition contemporaneous with transmission \u2014 had been overruled by the ECPA. Smith, 155 F.3d at 1057 n. 11. On the other hand, we suggested that the narrower definition of \"intercept\" was still appropriate with regard to electronic communications: [I]n cases concerning \"electronic communications\" \u2014 the definition of which specifically includes \"transfers\" and specifically excludes \"storage\" \u2014 the \"narrow\" definition of \"intercept\" fits like a glove; it is natural to except non-contemporaneous retrievals from the scope of the Wiretap Act. In fact, a number of courts adopting the narrow interpretation of \"interception\" have specifically premised their decisions to do so on the distinction between \u00a7 2510's definitions of wire and electronic communications.\n\n26\nSmith, 155 F.3d at 1057 (citations and alterations omitted).\n\n27\nWe agree with the Steve Jackson and Smith courts that the narrow definition of \"intercept\" applies to electronic communications. Notably, Congress has since amended the Wiretap Act to eliminate storage from the definition of wire communication, see USA PATRIOT Act \u00a7 209, 115 Stat. at 283, such that the textual distinction relied upon by the Steve Jackson and Smith courts no longer exists. This change, however, supports the analysis of those cases. By eliminating storage from the definition of wire communication, Congress essentially reinstated the pre-ECPA definition of \"intercept\" \u2014 acquisition contemporaneous with transmission \u2014 with respect to wire communications. See Smith, 155 F.3d at 1057 n. 11. The purpose of the recent amendment was to reduce protection of voice mail messages to the lower level of protection provided other electronically stored communications. See H.R. Rep. 107-236(I), at 158-59 (2001). When Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, it was aware of the narrow definition courts had given the term \"intercept\" with respect to electronic communications, but chose not to change or modify that definition. To the contrary, it modified the statute to make that definition applicable to voice mail messages as well. Congress, therefore, accepted and implicitly approved the judicial definition of \"intercept\" as acquisition contemporaneous with transmission.\n\n28\nWe therefore hold that for a website such as Konop's to be \"intercepted\" in violation of the Wiretap Act, it must be acquired during transmission, not while it is in electronic storage.6 This conclusion is consistent with the ordinary meaning of \"intercept,\" which is \"to stop, seize, or interrupt in progress or course before arrival.\" Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 630 (1985). More importantly, it is consistent with the structure of the ECPA, which created the SCA for the express purpose of addressing \"access to stored ... electronic communications and transactional records.\" S.Rep. No. 99-541 at 3 (emphasis added). The level of protection provided stored communications under the SCA is considerably less than that provided communications covered by the Wiretap Act. Section 2703(a) of the SCA details the procedures law enforcement must follow to access the contents of stored electronic communications, but these procedures are considerably less burdensome and less restrictive than those required to obtain a wiretap order under the Wiretap Act. See Steve Jackson Games, 36 F.3d at 463. Thus, if Konop's position were correct and acquisition of a stored electronic communication were an interception under the Wiretap Act, the government would have to comply with the more burdensome, more restrictive procedures of the Wiretap Act to do exactly what Congress apparently authorized it to do under the less burdensome procedures of the SCA. Congress could not have intended this result. As the Fifth Circuit recognized in Steve Jackson Games, \"it is most unlikely that Congress intended to require law enforcement officers to satisfy the more stringent requirements for an intercept in order to gain access to the contents of stored electronic communications.\" Id.; see also Wesley Coll., 974 F.Supp. at 388 (same).\n\n29\nBecause we conclude that Davis' conduct did not constitute an \"interception\" of an electronic communication in violation of the Wiretap Act, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment against Konop on his Wiretap Act claims.7\n\nC. Stored Communications Act\n\n30\nKonop also argues that, by viewing his secure website, Davis accessed a stored electronic communication without authorization in violation of the SCA. The SCA makes it an offense to \"intentionally access[] without authorization a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided ... and thereby obtain[] ... access to a wire or electronic communication while it is in electronic storage in such system.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701(a)(1). The SCA excepts from liability, however, \"conduct authorized ... by a user of that service with respect to a communication of or intended for that user.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701(c)(2). The district court found that the exception in \u00a7 2701(c)(2) applied because Wong and Gardner consented to Davis' use of Konop's website. It therefore granted summary judgment to Hawaiian on the SCA claim.\n\n31\nThe parties agree that the relevant \"electronic communications service\" is Konop's website, and that the website was in \"electronic storage.\" In addition, for the purposes of this opinion, we accept the parties' assumption that Davis' conduct constituted \"access without authorization\"8 to \"a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided.\"\n\n32\nWe therefore address only the narrow question of whether the district court properly found Hawaiian exempt from liability under \u00a7 2701(c)(2). Section 2701(c)(2) allows a person to authorize a third party's access to an electronic communication if the person is 1) a \"user\" of the \"service\" and 2) the communication is \"of or intended for that user.\" See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701(c)(2). A \"user\" is \"any person or entity who \u2014 (A) uses an electronic communications service; and (B) is duly authorized by the provider of such service to engage in such use.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(13).\n\n33\nThe district court concluded that Wong and Gardner had the authority under \u00a7 2701(c)(2) to consent to Davis' use of the website because Konop put Wong and Gardner on the list of eligible users. This conclusion is consistent with other parts of the Wiretap Act and the SCA which allow intended recipients of wire and electronic communications to authorize third parties to access those communications.9 In addition, there is some indication in the legislative history that Congress believed \"addressees\" or \"intended recipients\" of electronic communications would have the authority under the SCA to allow third parties access to those communications. See H.R.Rep. No. 99-647, at 66-67 (explaining that \"an addressee [of an electronic communication] may consent to the disclosure of a communication to any other person\" and that \"[a] person may be an `intended recipient' of a communication ... even if he is not individually identified by name or otherwise\").\n\n34\nNevertheless, the plain language of \u00a7 2701(c)(2) indicates that only a \"user\" of the service can authorize a third party's access to the communication. The statute defines \"user\" as one who 1) uses the service and 2) is duly authorized to do so. Because the statutory language is unambiguous, it must control our construction of the statute, notwithstanding the legislative history. See United States v. Daas, 198 F.3d 1167, 1174 (9th Cir.1999). The statute does not define the word \"use,\" so we apply the ordinary definition, which is \"to put into action or service, avail oneself of, employ.\" Webster's at 1299; see Daas, 198 F.3d at 1174 (\"If the statute uses a term which it does not define, the court gives that term its ordinary meaning.\").\n\n35\nBased on the common definition of the word \"use,\" we cannot find any evidence in the record that Wong ever used Konop's website. There is some evidence, however, that Gardner may have used the website, but it is unclear when that use occurred. At any rate, the district court did not make any findings on whether Wong and Gardner actually used Konop's website \u2014 it simply assumed that Wong and Gardner, by virtue of being eligible to view the website, could authorize Davis' access. The problem with this approach is that it essentially reads the \"user\" requirement out of \u00a7 2701(c)(2). Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Konop, we must assume that neither Wong nor Gardner was a \"user\" of the website at the time he authorized Davis to view it. We therefore reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment to Hawaiian on Konop's SCA claim.\n\nII. Railway Labor Act Claims\n\n36\nKonop also appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment to Hawaiian on his claims under the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-188 (\"RLA\"). The RLA prohibits \"interference, influence, or coercion by either party over the designation of representatives by the other.\" 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 (Third). It also declares that \"it shall be unlawful for any carrier to interfere in any way with the organization of its employees, or to use the funds of the carrier in maintaining or assisting or contributing to any labor organization, labor representative, or other agency of collective bargaining....\" Id. at \u00a7 152 (Fourth).\n\n37\nKonop asserts three claims under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 (Third) and (Fourth) of the RLA. First, Konop alleges that Hawaiian interfered with his organizing efforts by accessing his website under false pretenses. Second, Konop alleges that Hawaiian wrongfully assisted a labor group by disclosing the contents of Konop's website to a union leader who supported the concessionary contract. Third, Konop alleges that Hawaiian engaged in coercion and intimidation by threatening to file a defamation suit against Konop based on statements on the website. The district court dismissed these claims on the alternative grounds that it lacked jurisdiction over the RLA claims, and that Konop failed to support them with evidence sufficient to withstand summary judgment.\n\nA. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n38\nFederal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over disputes which are \"grounded in the [collective bargaining agreement],\" Haw. Airlines, Inc. v. Norris, 512 U.S. 246, 256, 114 S. Ct. 2239, 129 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1994), and \"involve controversies over the meaning of an existing collective bargaining agreement in a particular fact situation,\" id. at 253, 114 S. Ct. 2239 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such disputes, labeled \"minor\" disputes under the RLA, are subject to mandatory arbitration. Id. Hawaiian argues, and the district court agreed, that Konop's RLA claims are grounded in the collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") and are therefore subject to mandatory arbitration. We disagree.\n\n39\nIn Fennessy v. Southwest Airlines, 91 F.3d 1359 (9th Cir.1996), we addressed whether the district court had jurisdiction over the plaintiff's statutory claim under the RLA. The plaintiff in Fennessy alleged that the carrier violated 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 (Fourth) by terminating his employment in retaliation for his efforts to replace the existing union. Id. at 1360-61. We held that \"because his claim is based on a statutory provision rather than on the collective bargaining contract, it is not a minor dispute that must be brought to [arbitration]; it is a statutory claim that he may bring directly in district court.\" Id. at 1362. The plaintiff's unsuccessful arbitration of a related contractual claim under the CBA did not alter this conclusion. Because the statutory claims were not \"grounded in the collective-bargaining agreement,\" and the statutory rights were \"independent of the CBA,\" we found the district court had jurisdiction. Id.\n\n40\nHawaiian argues that, unlike the statutory claim in Fennessy, Konop's statutory claims are grounded in and dependent on the CBA. To support this position, Hawaiian focuses on conduct which Konop explicitly alleged in his complaint as violating the CBA. Specifically, in the RLA section of the complaint, Konop alleged that Hawaiian violated the CBA by suspending him from work, reducing his employee benefits, requiring him to submit to physical and psychological testing, and giving certain pilots paid opportunities to campaign in favor of the concessionary contract.\n\n41\nOn appeal, however, Konop does not challenge the district court's dismissal of these CBA-related claims. Rather, he objects to the district court's dismissal of his independent RLA claims. Konop claims that Hawaiian violated the RLA by (1) accessing his website under false pretenses, (2) disclosing the website's contents to the rival union faction, and (3) threatening to sue Konop for defamation based on statements on the website. Hawaiian never explains how these RLA claims are grounded in the CBA, except to say that Konop merely presents them as a precursor to the alleged CBA violations. Nothing, however, requires such a narrow reading of Konop's allegations. Konop, like the plaintiff in Fennessy, presents his statutory claims as independent violations of the RLA. These claims in no way depend upon a finding that Hawaiian, at some later time, violated Konop's contractual rights under the CBA.\n\n42\nAccordingly, we hold that the RLA claims which Konop presses on appeal are not grounded in the CBA, are not subject to mandatory arbitration and, therefore, fall within the court's jurisdiction.\n\nB. Protected Activity\n\n43\nHawaiian contends that even if Hawaiian managers accessed Konop's website under false pretenses, conveyed this information to a rival union leader, and threatened to sue Konop for defamation, such conduct did not violate the RLA because it did not interfere with any protected organizing activity. The organizing activity in which Konop engaged principally involved the publication of articles on a secure website. As discussed above, Konop limited access to pilots and other employees on the eligible list and prohibited users from disclosing the contents of the website to others. He also categorically excluded managers. Konop's website publication vigorously criticized Hawaiian management and its proposal for wage concessions in the existing collective bargaining agreement. Because the incumbent union, ALPA, supported the concessionary contract, Konop sought to encourage consideration of alternative union representation.\n\n44\nThere is no dispute that Konop's website publication would ordinarily constitute protected union organizing activity under the RLA. Hawaiian argues, however, that Konop forfeited any protection he would otherwise enjoy because his articles contained malicious, defamatory and insulting material known to be false. In Linn v. United Plant Guard Workers, Local 114, 383 U.S. 53, 61, 86 S. Ct. 657, 15 L. Ed. 2d 582 (1966), the Supreme Court held that a party forfeits his protection under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by \"circulating defamatory or insulting material known to be false.\"10 See also Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat'l Ass'n of Letter Carriers v. Austin, 418 U.S. 264, 282-83, 94 S. Ct. 2770, 41 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1974); San Antonio Comm. Hosp. v. S. Cal. Dist. Council of Carpenters, 125 F.3d 1230, 1237 (9th Cir.1997).\n\n45\nWe assume Hawaiian is referring to the alleged defamatory statements contained in the \"Facts\" section of its brief. There, Hawaiian indicates that Konop published the following false statements: (1) Nobles does his \"dirty work ... like the Nazis during World War II\"; (2) \"Soviet Negotiating Style Essential to Nobles Plan!\"; (3) Nobles is \"one incompetent at the top.\"; (4) Nobles \"has little skill and little ability with people.... In fact, with as few skills as Nobles possesses, it is difficult to imagine how he got this far\"; and (5) \"Nobles Suspected in Fraud!\" and \"Hawaiian Air president, Bruce Nobles, is the prime suspect in an alleged fraud which took place in 1991.\"\n\n46\nThe first two statements, referencing the Nazis and Soviets, are simply \"rhetorical hyperbole\" protected by federal labor laws. See Letter Carriers, 418 U.S. at 286, 94 S. Ct. 2770. The second two statements, commenting on Nobles' competence and people skills, are opinions also protected by federal labor laws. See id. at 284, 94 S. Ct. 2770; San Antonio Comm. Hosp., 125 F.3d at 1237. Konop did not forfeit his protection under the Railway Labor Act, as Hawaiian suggests, simply by publishing statements that were critical of and insulting to Nobles. \"`[F]ederal law gives a union license to use intemperate, abusive, or insulting language without fear of restraint or penalty....'\" San Antonio Comm. Hosp., 125 F.3d at 1235 (quoting Letter Carriers, 418 U.S. at 283, 94 S. Ct. 2770) (emphasis added); see also Linn, 383 U.S. at 58, 86 S. Ct. 657 (\"[R]epresentation campaigns are frequently characterized by bitter and extreme charges, countercharges, unfounded rumors, vituperations, personal accusations, misrepresentations and distortions.\").11\n\n47\nWith respect to the final challenged statement, indicating that Nobles was suspected of fraud, Hawaiian fails to argue or present any evidence that Konop published the statement with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth. Federal labor law protects even false and defamatory statements unless such statements are made with actual malice \u2014 i.e., knowledge of falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth. See Letter Carriers, 418 U.S. at 281, 94 S. Ct. 2770; Linn, 383 U.S. at 61, 86 S. Ct. 657 (protection under labor law existed \"even though the statements [were] erroneous and defame[d] one of the parties to the dispute\"). With no evidence or argument that Konop acted with actual malice, Hawaiian cannot demonstrate as a matter of law that Konop forfeited his protection under the RLA.\n\n48\nNLRB v. Pincus Bros., Inc.-Maxwell, 620 F.2d 367 (3d Cir.1980) (as amended), upon which Hawaiian principally relies, provides little support for Hawaiian's position. In Pincus Bros., the Third Circuit, in considering whether the NLRB abused its discretion by declining to defer to an arbitration award, merely concluded it was \"at least arguable\" that the employee published a defamatory statement known to be false. Id. at 376. For Hawaiian to prevail on summary judgment, however, it must do more than show it is \"at least arguable\" that Konop knew the challenged statement was false. It must demonstrate this as a matter of law. As Hawaiian presents no evidence or argument that Konop acted with the requisite malice, Hawaiian falls short of satisfying this burden.\n\n49\nAccordingly, we find that Konop has raised a triable issue of fact with respect to whether the development and maintenance of his website constituted protected activity under the RLA.\n\nC. Specific Violations\n\n50\nKonop argues that Hawaiian managers: (1) interfered with Konop's organizing efforts by viewing the website under false pretenses, (2) wrongfully supported one labor group in favor of another by informing the opposing labor faction of the website's contents, and (3) engaged in coercion and intimidation by threatening to sue Konop for defamation, all in violation of the RLA. Hawaiian argues, and the district court agreed, that Konop failed to present sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on these claims. We disagree.\n\n1. Access of Website\n\n51\nKonop argues that Davis interfered with Konop's organizing efforts by viewing the website under false pretenses. Absent a legitimate justification, employers are generally prohibited from engaging in surveillance of union organizing activities. Cal. Acrylic Indus. v. NLRB, 150 F.3d 1095, 1099-1100 (9th Cir.1998). The reason for this general proscription is that employer surveillance \"tends to create fear among employees of future reprisal\" and, thus, \"chills an employee's freedom to exercise\" his rights under federal labor law. Id. at 1099.\n\n52\nIn NLRB v. Unbelievable, Inc., 71 F.3d 1434 (9th Cir.1995), we upheld the Board's finding that the employer \"engaged in unfair labor practices by eavesdropping on private conversations between employees and [a] Union representative,\" which occurred in the employee break room. Id. at 1438-39. We see no principled distinction between the employer's eavesdropping in Unbelievable and Hawaiian's access of Konop's secure website.\n\n53\nHawaiian suggests that Davis had a legitimate reason to access Konop's website \u2014 to identify and correct any false or misleading statements. Assuming such a concern could justify Davis' monitoring of private union organizing activities, Hawaiian has presented little evidence to suggest that any statements on Konop's website were actually defamatory. Moreover, as discussed below, there are triable issues whether Hawaiian used information it obtained from the website to assist one union faction over another, and to coerce and intimidate Konop. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Konop has raised a triable issue that Hawaiian's access of Konop's website was not justified.\n\n54\nHawaiian also argues that Davis' access did not violate the RLA because it did not appreciably limit Konop's organizing activities. Hawaiian emphasizes that, after learning about Davis' access to the website, Konop restricted access for a mere half-day and declined to temper the language in his articles. Hawaiian, however, presents no authority indicating that employees subject to surveillance or eavesdropping must also demonstrate that they consequently limited their organizing activity. It is the tendency to chill protected activities, not the actual chilling of protected activities, that renders eavesdropping and surveillance generally objectionable under federal labor law. See, e.g., Cal. Acrylic, 150 F.3d at 1099-1100. That a hardy individual might continue his organizing activities undeterred, despite an employer's surveillance, does not render the employer's conduct any less of a violation.12\n\n55\nAccordingly, we find that Konop has raised a triable issue of fact that Hawaiian interfered with Konop's union organizing activity in violation of the RLA by accessing Konop's website.\n\n2. Disclosure to Opposing Union\n\n56\nKonop argues that Nobles unlawfully assisted Reno Morella, the union leader who supported the concessionary contract, by disclosing the contents of Konop's website. Generally, the RLA prohibits employers from providing assistance to a union or labor faction. See Barthelemy v. Air Lines Pilots Ass'n, 897 F.2d 999, 1009 (9th Cir.1990) (per curiam); see also NLRB v. Finishline Indus., 451 F.2d 1280, 1281-82 (9th Cir.1971) (NLRA prohibits employer from telling workers to withdraw from one union and join another); NLRB v. L. Ronney & Sons Furniture Mfg. Co., 206 F.2d 730, 734-35 (9th Cir.1953) (NLRA prohibits employer from initiating membership drive among his employees for employer-favored union).\n\n57\nKonop argues that Nobles disclosed useful intelligence to a rival union faction in an effort to ensure that Konop's faction, which opposed the concessionary contract, would not prevail. Hawaiian does not seriously dispute that disclosure of the contents of Konop's website to Morella would constitute improper assistance. Instead, Hawaiian argues that Konop failed to present sufficient evidence that Nobles made any such disclosure or that Nobles was even familiar with the contents of Konop's website when he spoke to Morella.\n\n58\nMorella, however, states in his declaration that Nobles contacted him on December 14, 1995 and informed him \"that he had just reviewed information which was posted on an internet communications system operated by Hawaiian Airlines Pilot Robert Konop.\" In addition, Morella states that Nobles also \"disclosed to me that Konop's internet communications system contained a third written article concerning Konop's efforts to obtain union representation by a labor organization other than the Air Line Pilots Association.\" This evidence creates a genuine issue of fact whether Nobles was familiar with the contents of Konop's website and whether Nobles disclosed the contents of the website to Morella.\n\n59\nMoreover, Nobles confirmed in his declaration that he contacted Morella because he \"felt that Reno Morella, the Chairman of the ALPA Master Executive Council, should be aware of the newsletter because of its inaccurate attack on the proposed labor agreements and the unfair effect it could have on the ratification process.\" Nobles thus effectively concedes that he interceded to help ensure that Morella's faction \u2014 which favored ratification of the concessionary contract \u2014 would prevail over Konop's faction, which opposed the agreement.\n\n60\nAccordingly, we find that Konop has raised a triable issue of fact whether Nobles improperly assisted one union faction over another in violation of the RLA.\n\n3. Threat of Defamation Suit\n\n61\nKonop argues that Nobles engaged in unlawful coercion and intimidation by threatening to file a defamation suit against Konop based on statements on Konop's website. An employer's filing or threatened filing of a lawsuit against an employee concerning union organizing activities may, under certain circumstances, violate the RLA. See, e.g., Diamond Walnut Growers, Inc. v. NLRB, 53 F.3d 1085, 1089-90 (9th Cir.1995) (finding employer's defamation lawsuit against union violated NLRA); GHR Energy Corp., 294 N.L.R.B. 1011, 1014 (1989) (analyzing whether employer's threat to sue employee for defamation violated NLRA), aff'd, 924 F.2d 1055 (5th Cir.1991).\n\n62\nHawaiian does not argue that Nobles would be justified in threatening to sue Konop for defamation. Instead, Hawaiian contends that Konop failed to present sufficient evidence that Nobles ever made such a threat. Nobles stated in his declaration that he \"did mention to Morella that the gross inaccuracies and lies in the newsletter made by Konop amounted to defamation,\" but that he \"never said that [he] intended to file a lawsuit against Konop.\"\n\n63\nMorella, however, indicates otherwise. Morella states in his declaration, \"Nobles advised me that Konop should be cautioned, or informed, of the possibility of a defamation lawsuit by Nobles.\" Morella also testified, \"[I]t was my impression and conclusion that Nobles intended for me to contact Konop, or take other action, for the purpose of opposing Konop's efforts to seek alternative union representation.\" Morella then \"informed Konop of Mr. Nobles' statements ... regarding caution with respect to a possible lawsuit against Konop for defamation.\" Konop confirms the same in his declaration. This evidence is sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact whether Nobles threatened to sue Konop for defamation.\n\n64\nAccordingly, we find that Konop has raised a triable issue of fact whether Nobles engaged in coercion and intimidation in violation of the RLA by threatening to sue Konop for defamation.\n\nD. Bench Trial on Retaliation Claim\n\n65\nKonop's retaliation claim under the RLA was tried to the district court. The district court entered judgment against him on this claim, which involved his allegation that Hawaiian violated the RLA when it placed him on sick leave in retaliation for protected labor activities. Konop challenges the district court's judgment on this claim on the ground that his subpoenas for corroborating witnesses were improperly quashed. We review a district court's order quashing subpoenas for an abuse of discretion. United States v. Berberian, 767 F.2d 1324, 1324 (9th Cir.1985). A litigant whose subpoenas have been improperly quashed must also show prejudice. See Casino Foods Corp. v. Kraftco Corp., 546 F.2d 301, 302 (9th Cir.1976).\n\n66\nThere is some dispute whether the district court's remarks in a pretrial hearing constituted an order to quash subpoenas at all. Assuming, however, that the district court did quash Konop's subpoenas, Konop has not suggested what relevant evidence the subpoenaed witnesses might have provided had they been compelled to testify. Konop has consequently failed to show that he was prejudiced. Accordingly, the district court's judgment against Konop on his retaliation claim under the RLA is affirmed.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n67\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's judgment with respect to Konop's Wiretap Act claims and his retaliation claim under the Railway Labor Act. We reverse the district court's judgment on Konop's Stored Communications Act claims and his claims under the Railway Labor Act for interference with organizing activities, wrongful support of a union faction, and coercion and intimidation.\n\n68\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\n\nNotes:\n\n1\nThe parties dispute the date and substance of this phone conversation. Because the district court granted summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable to Konop\n\n2\nThe Wiretap Act and SCA have since been amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA PATRIOT Act), Pub.L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272 (October 26, 2001)\n\n3\nSpecifically, Konop configured the website to allow access when a person typed in the correct web address, received the home page of his website, entered the name of an eligible person, created a password, and clicked the \"SUBMIT\" button indicating acceptance of the terms and conditions of use.

No. 99-647, at 34.\n\n5\nUntil October 2001, \"wire communication\" was defined as \"any aural transfer made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception ... andsuch term includes any electronic storage of such communication....\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(1) (2000) (emphasis added).\n\n6\nThe dissent, amici, and several law review articles argue that the term \"intercept\" must apply to electronic communications in storage because storage is a necessary incident to the transmission of electronic communicationsSee, e.g., Akamine, supra, at 561-65; Jarrod J. White, E-Mail@Work.Com: Employer Monitoring of Employee E-Mail, 48 Ala. L.Rev. 1079, 1083 (1997). Email and other electronic communications are stored at various junctures in various computers between the time the sender types the message and the recipient reads it. In addition, the transmission time of email is very short because it travels across the wires at the speed of light. It is therefore argued that if the term \"intercept\" does not apply to the en route storage of electronic communications, the Wiretap Act's prohibition against \"intercepting\" electronic communications would have virtually no effect. While this argument is not without appeal, the language and structure of the ECPA demonstrate that Congress considered and rejected this argument. Congress defined \"electronic storage\" as \"any temporary, intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(17)(A), indicating that Congress understood that electronic storage was an inherent part of electronic communication. Nevertheless, as discussed above, Congress chose to afford stored electronic communications less protection than other forms of communication.\n\n7\nKonop also claims that Hawaiian violated the Wiretap Act when Davis used and disclosed the contents of Konop's website. As there was no interception under the Wiretap Act, this claim also fails\n\n8\nThe term \"without authorization\" is not defined in the statuteCf. EF Cultural Travel BV v. Explorica, Inc., 274 F.3d 577, 581-82 & n. 10 (1st Cir.2001) (explaining, with respect to alleged unauthorized use of a website, Congress' failure to define \"without authorization\" in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and discussing some possible, practicable definitions of the term). There is some indication in the legislative history that Congress intended the configuration of the electronic communication system to \"establish an objective standard [for] determining whether a system receives privacy protection.\" H.R.Rep. No. 99-647, at 41. Since the issue is not properly before us, however, we express no opinion on how the term \"without authorization\" should be defined with respect to a non-public website such as Konop's.\n\n9\nFor instance, \u00a7 2702(b)(1) permits service providers to divulge the contents of stored communications \"to an addressee or intended recipient of such communication or an agent of such addressee or intended recipient.\"See also id. \u00a7 2702(b)(3) (providing a similar exception with respect to remote computing services). Similarly, the \"consent\" exception to the Wiretap Act allows one party to a wire communication to authorize a third party to intercept the communication. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(c) & (d).\n\n10\nWhile employers covered under the RLA are not subject to the provisions of the NLRA, courts look to the NLRA and the cases interpreting it for guidanceBhd. of R.R. Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U.S. 369, 383, 89 S. Ct. 1109, 22 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1969). We see no reason why the rule announced in Linn, 383 U.S. at 61, 86 S. Ct. 657, regarding protected activities, should not apply in the context of the RLA.\n\n11\nWe recognize that some organizing activity may be \"so flagrant, violent or extreme\" or so \"egregious,\" \"opprobrious,\" \"offensive,\" \"obscene\" or \"wholly unjustified\" that it loses the protection of the RLASee Reef Indus. v. NLRB, 952 F.2d 830, 837 & n. 19 (5th Cir.1991) (per curiam); Timekeeping Sys., Inc. & Lawrence Leinweber, 323 N.L.R.B. 244, 248-50 (1997). It is not clear whether Hawaiian is contending that Konop's conduct falls within one of these more amorphous standards. Assuming Hawaiian does so contend, we nevertheless find Hawaiian has failed to demonstrate that, as a matter of law, Konop's activities were so intolerable as to lose their protection under the RLA.\n\n12\nHawaiian also presents this argument to defeat the other two alleged RLA claims discussed in the following sections. We find it is no more persuasive in the context of those claims\n\n69\nREINHARDT, Circuit Judge, concurring in part, dissenting in part.\n\n70\nI concur in Part C of Section I of the majority opinion regarding Konop's claims under the Stored Communications Act, and Section II of the majority opinion regarding Konop's claims under the Railway Labor Act. I dissent, however, from Part B of Section I, which holds that the term \"intercept\" in the Wiretap Act, as applied to electronic communications, refers solely to contemporaneous acquisition. I conclude instead that \"stored electronic communications\" are subject to the statute's intercept prohibition as well.\n\n71\nBecause I recognize that any reading of the relevant statutory provisions raises some difficulties and introduces some inconsistencies, the question becomes: which reading is more coherent and more consistent with Congressional intent? The majority reasons, and I agree, that stored electronic communications are covered under the definition of \"electronic communications\" in the Wiretap Act. However, having made that determination, the majority proceeds to introduce unnecessary confusion and incoherence into the statute by holding that \"intercept\" encompasses only contemporaneous acquisition of electronic communications, and thus that it is not possible to \"intercept\" a stored electronic communication. We have already rejected just such a contemporaneity requirement with respect to the acquisition of stored wire communications, and there is no justification for reviving it with respect to stored electronic communications. United States v. Smith, 155 F.3d 1051, 1057 n. 11, 1058 (9th Cir.1998).\n\n72\nThe contemporaneity requirement for interception first appeared in United States v. Turk, 526 F.2d 654 (5th Cir.1976), in which the Fifth Circuit held that the definition of \"intercept\" in the statute \"require[s] participation by the one charged with an `interception' in the contemporaneous acquisition of the communication through the use of [a] device.\" 526 F.2d at 658 (emphasis added). In Turk, however, the Fifth Circuit was interpreting a version of the Wiretap Act that predates the one at issue in Smith and in this case. That version did not cover interception of stored wire communications or of electronic communications at all. The statute was subsequently amended to include electronic communications, stored electronic communications, and stored wire communications in 1986.1 Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Pub.L. No. 99-508. 100 Stat. 1848. Thereafter, in Smith, 155 F.3d 1051, 1057 n. 11, 1058 (9th Cir.1998), this court held, in a case involving the acquisition of stored voicemail messages, that Turk's contemporaneity requirement had been \"statutorily overruled,\" at least with respect to wire communications, by the changes in the statute which brought stored wire communications within its purview. The Smith court reasoned that \"intercept\" must necessarily include non-contemporaneous acquisition of stored wire communications because Congress had deliberately inserted stored wire communications into the intercept provision despite the fact that contemporaneous acquisition of stored wire communications is, by definition, impossible. 155 F.3d at 1058. To read \"intercept\" to include only contemporaneous acquisition would, of course, have rendered the intercept prohibition with respect to stored wire communications meaningless. Id.\n\n73\nHere, the majority's definition of \"intercept\" renders that prohibition meaningless with respect to stored electronic communications. The majority opinion would result in eliminating stored electronic communications from the purview of the intercept prohibition altogether, because a stored communication cannot be acquired contemporaneously with its transmission \u2014 it has already been transmitted. The majority's reading of the statute simply doesn't work: while explicitly holding that stored electronic communications are within the term \"electronic communications\" and that the intercept prohibition of the Wiretap Act applies to electronic communications, it also explicitly holds that interception of electronic communications is limited to contemporaneous acquisition, thereby simultaneously including and excluding stored electronic communications from the intercept prohibition.\n\n74\nTo read a contemporaneity requirement into the definition of \"intercept\" renders the prohibition against the electronic communication interception largely superfluous, and violates the precept against interpreting one provision of a statute to negate another. See e.g., Sorenson v. Secretary of the Treasury, 475 U.S. 851, 106 S. Ct. 1600, 89 L. Ed. 2d 855 (1986) (applying the whole act rule to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981). Intercept of electronic communications is defined as any \"acquisition of the contents of any ... electronic ... communication through the use of any ... device.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(4). The nature of electronic communication is that it spends infinitesmal amounts of time \"en route,\" unlike a phone call. Therefore, in order to \"intercept\" an electronic communication, one ordinarily obtains one of the copies made en route or at the destination. These copies constitute \"stored electronic communications,\" as acknowledged by the majority. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(17)(A)(\"`electronic storage' means ... any temporary, intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication incidental to the electronic transmission thereof\"). If intercept is defined as solely contemporaneous acquisition, then in contravention of Congressional intent, at most all acquisitions of the contents of electronic communications would escape the intercept prohibition entirely. Jarrod J. White, Commentary, E-Mail@Work.Com: Employer Monitoring of Employee E-Mail, 48 Ala. L.Rev. 1079, 1083 (1997) (\"Following the Fifth Circuit's rationale, [and excluding stored electronic communications from the intercept prohibition] there is only a narrow window during which an E-mail interception may occur \u2014 the seconds or milliseconds before which a newly composed message is saved to any temporary location following a send command. Therefore, ... [assuming that stored communications are excluded from the intercept prohibition], interception of E-mail within the prohibition of the ECPA is virtually impossible.\").\n\n75\nThe majority asserts that it is reasonable that the term \"intercept\" would describe different conduct with respect to wire communications than with respect to electronic communications because different actions are required to intercept different kinds of communications. This reasoning fails because, although wire communications and electronic communications are quite different, stored wire communications are technologically equivalent to stored electronic communications. Thus it would make little sense to treat them differently. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(1) (defining \"wire communication\" as including \"any electronic storage of[wire] communication\"). While Congress may not always act sensibly, there is no reason for the majority to presume that it failed to do so in this instance.\n\n76\nThe Non-Contemporaneous Acquisition Reading Permits a Coherent Reading of the Wiretap Act and the Stored Communications Act Together, Consistent with Congressional Intent\n\n77\nCongress's clear intent, when amending the statute in 1986, was to regulate access to and acquisition of stored electronic communications. See S.Rep. No. 99-541 at 3-4 (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3557-8 (discussing Congressional intent to cover email and computerized recordkeeping systems). The majority's interpretation of the Wiretap Act depends in part on a tortured reading of the Stored Communications Act under which \"access to\" a communication is equated with \"acquisition of\" a communication, contrary to clear statutory language. Sections 2701 and 2703 of the Stored Communications Act regulate \"access\" to facilities where communications are stored and \"access\" to the communications themselves. The majority, relying on Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Serv., 36 F.3d 457, 463 (5th Cir.1994) somehow reads these provisions as being analogous to the \"intercept\" provisions of the Wiretap Act. 236 F.3d at 1044. However, \"access\" is more properly understood as being qualitatively different from \"intercept,\" not temporally different, and as constituting a lesser included offense of \"intercept.\" The \"access\" prohibitions in \u00a7 2701, in contrast to those regarding \"interception\" in \u00a7 2511, do not mention at all \"acquisition\" of the \"contents\" of any communication, but only \"access,\" authorized and unauthorized, to them. \"Access\" is not defined in the statute, and therefore courts must apply the ordinary or technical meaning that the word has in the context of electronic communications. \"Access\" is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"[t]he habit or power of getting near or into contact with; entrance, admittance, admission (to the presence or use of) [noun]\" and \"[t]o gain access to (data, etc., held in a computer or computer-based system, or the system itself) [transitive verb].\" As discussed above, \"intercept\" is defined in the statute as the actual acquisition of the contents of a communication. Given the plain language of the statute, the difference between the prohibition in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 (\"intercept\") and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701 (\"access\") becomes more than semantic; it indicates that Congress intended that only 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 prohibit the actual acquisition of the contents of a communication.\n\n78\nOn the other hand, section 2703 (the structure of which the panel claims supports a \"contemporaneous acquisition\" reading of the text) sets out the parameters under which governmental authorities can gain \"access\" to the \"contents\" of stored electronic communications. That section provides that governmental authorities may obtain a search warrant to compel electronic communication service providers to disclose the contents of stored electronic communications. By its plain terms, it does not provide a judicial means by which government authorities can independently intercept or acquire the contents of electronic communications. That is covered under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516. Having excluded stored electronic communications from the Wiretap Act, the majority is forced to torture the statutory language of the Stored Communications Act in order to craft a reading of the statutes which accomplishes Congress's intent of establishing procedures by which governmental authorities may directly acquire the contents of stored electronic communications. A reading of the Wiretap Act which includes stored electronic communications under the intercept prohibition provides a plain answer \u2014 one that does not require linguistic gymnastics.\n\n79\nFurthermore, contrary to the arguments of Hawaiian Airlines and its amici, the drafting of a separate act specifically governing the contents of stored electronic communications (Stored Communications Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2702-03) was necessary, even though stored communications were included in the Wiretap Act. First, the damage caused by computer hackers (also known as \"electronic trespassers\") was a major concern of Congress in enacting the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Stored Communications Act. The separate provisions prohibiting unauthorized access were found necessary, in addition to the pre-existing prohibitions on interception, because computer hackers often do a great deal of damage to stored communications facilities and stored communications without ever acquiring the contents of those communications. See United States v. Smith, 155 F.3d 1051, 1058-59 (9th Cir.1998) (explaining that the Stored Communications Act permits penalties against hackers who put themselves in the position to acquire a communication, but the Wiretap Act penalizes those who go further and acquire the communication); In re DoubleClick, Inc. Privacy Litigation, 154 F. Supp. 2d 497 at 507 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (finding that Title II of ECPA was aimed at computer hackers); Sherman & Co. v. Salton Maxim Housewares, Inc., 94 F. Supp. 2d 817, 820 (E.D.Mich.2000) (explaining that the general purpose of the ECPA was to create a cause of action against computer hackers.); State Wide Photocopy, Corp. v. Tokai Financial Services, Inc., 909 F. Supp. 137, 145 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (\"[T]he ECPA was primarily designed to provide a cause of action against computer hackers....\"). Hackers often use their unauthorized access to disrupt or prevent authorized access of others to stored communications facilities. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701 (prohibiting obtaining, altering or preventing access to wire or electronic communications without authorization). Moreover, the activities of hackers, and the mere potential that they could acquire the contents of electronic or wire communications in storage, create an atmosphere of anxiety in which computer users do not feel confident about the confidentiality of their communications, and productivity is hampered. These were all major concerns of Congress in enacting the Stored Communications Act, concerns which necessitated the drafting of a separate act even though stored electronic communications were already included under the definition of electronic communications.\n\n80\nSecond, it is in the nature of electronic communication to be stored (both temporarily and permanently, as Congress indicated in the definition of electronic storage, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(17)), and it is in the nature of the electronic communications industry that electronic communications service providers (defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(15)) have possession and control over large amounts of stored electronic communications. Therefore, electronic communications service providers would be an obvious source for law enforcement authorities who seek to obtain the contents of electronic communications. Recognizing that compelling disclosure by these entities would be one means by which government authorities might seek to obtain the contents of communications, Congress added a section setting out the procedures for compelling such disclosure. Michael S. Leib, E Mail and the Wiretap Laws: Why Congress Should Add Electronic Communication to Title III's Statutory Exclusionary Rule and Expressly Reject a \"Good Faith\" Exception, 34 Harv. J. on Legis. 393, 414 (1997). There is no analogous storage of wire communication by wire communication service providers (i.e., telephone companies, also included under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(15)) such that guidelines would be needed on how governmental authorities could compel disclosure of stored wire communications from them.\n\n81\nThird, the Stored Communications Act is necessary to police the unauthorized access to electronic and wire communications facilities that is a necessary antecedent to illegal interception of those communications in storage. Were Congress to prohibit only actual acquisition of the contents of communications in storage, law enforcement would be powerless to do anything about persons who gained unauthorized access in preparation for interception (i.e., the acquisition of the contents of communications) until such persons had actually accomplished their unlawful mission. Further, because acquisition of the contents of an electronic communication in storage, or a wire communication in electronic storage does not disturb the \"original\" copy of such communication, actual acquisition of these communications is likely to be much more difficult to detect and prove than unauthorized access to a facility. Therefore it is helpful to law enforcement to have in its arsenal a separate provision governing access.\n\n82\nIn sum, a reading of the Wiretap Act that includes stored electronic communications in the statute's \"intercept\" prohibition is consistent with the nature of the technology at issue, leaves no unexplained statutory gaps, and renders none of the myriad provisions of either the Wiretap Act or the Stored Communications Act superfluous. Under such a reading, the Wiretap Act would prohibit the interception of electronic communications, both stored and en route, and subject violators to serious penalties. It would permit law enforcement to intercept such communications using a court order as indicated in \u00a7 2516. (Whether or not it would preserve the use of other less savory techniques is a matter this court is not called upon to decide.) A court order can be obtained by state prosecutors in connection with any one of a number of enumerated crimes, and by any assistant United States attorney for the investigation of any federal felony. Wire communications are treated similarly with only minor exceptions (for example, authorization to intercept wire communications is only available for a finite, though extensive, list of federal crimes); this reading, consistent with Congressional intent as revealed in the legislative history of the statute, rejects the idea that stored electronic communications are afforded a lesser degree of protection from interception than stored wire communications.2\n\n83\nPrior Precedent on the Wiretap Act and the Stored Communications Act Does Not Preclude the Non-Contemporaneous Acquisition Reading\n\n84\nThis is a case of first impression in this circuit, and there is no binding authority on the regulation of stored electronic communications. There are no Supreme Court cases interpreting the provisions of the Wiretap Act and the Stored Communications Act as they relate to electronic communications, and the court of appeals decisions, in our circuit and others, either do not deal with stored electronic communications, or are superseded by changes in law and technology, or both. United States v. Turk predates the addition of the electronic provisions and language to the statute, and therefore is of little relevance.  526 F.2d 654 (5th Cir.1976). More important, its contemporaneity requirement was expressly repudiated in United States v. Smith. 155 F.3d 1051, 1057 n. 11, 1058 (9th Cir.1998) (\"[T]o the extent that Turk stands for a definition of \"intercept\" that necessarily entails contemporaneity, it has ... been statutorily overruled.\"). Steve Jackson Games is the only circuit court case that involves stored electronic communications. As discussed above, the Fifth Circuit's reasoning is flawed, as it fails to consider the difference between \"access\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701 and \"intercept\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 and erroneously conflates the terms, reading them both to refer to the acquisition of the contents of a communication. 36 F.3d at 463. Moreover, Steve Jackson Games is rendered somewhat obsolete by the growth of the Internet, a phenomenon that the judges deciding that case could not have meaningfully incorporated into their reading of the statute. In particular, it would have been impossible to anticipate the expectations of privacy that people would develop regarding the Internet, expectations that are crucial to interpreting the statutory scheme consistent with Congressional intent to protect privacy interests. The other cases cited by the majority are district court cases, not binding on this court; they also have little persuasive value because they rely on the flawed reasoning of Steve Jackson Games and on the contemporaneity requirement that this court has rejected. See Wesley College v. Pitts, 974 F. Supp. 375, 386 (D.Del.1997), aff'd, 172 F.3d 861 (3d Cir.1998) (affirmed by the Third Circuit in an unpublished disposition, which therefore has no precedential value); United States v. Reyes, 922 F. Supp. 818, 836 (S.D.N.Y.1996); Bohach v. City of Reno, 932 F. Supp. 1232, 1236-37 (D.Nev. 1996). Although this court in United States v. Smith correctly recognized the access/intercept distinction, our opinion contained unfortunate dicta regarding electronic communications. 155 F.3d 1051 at 1057. Because the case involved wire, not electronic, communications, those statements are not binding upon us.\n\nConclusion\n\n85\nIn conclusion, because I believe that reading the Wiretap Act to prohibit interception of \"stored electronic communications\" provides a more coherent construction of the Act and is more consistent with the text of the statute as well as with the Congressional intent underlying both the Wiretap Act and the Stored Communications Act, I respectfully dissent from Part B of Section I of the majority opinion.\n\nNotes:\n\n1\nThe statute was again recently amended, this time to repeal the inclusion of stored wire communications in the definition of wire communication. Uniting and Strengthening America By Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot Act) Act of 2001, Pub.L. No. 107-56, \u00a7 209, 115 Stat. 272, 283 (enacted October 26, 2001). However we apply here the version that was in effect at the time of the acts in question, Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Pub.L. No. 99-508. 100 Stat. 1848\n\n2\nIn its interpretation of the term \"intercept,\" the majority relies in part on legislative history from the USA Patriot Act.

Hunter Jr.\n\n618 S.E.2d 807 (2005)\nSTATE of North Carolina\nv.\nCynthia JOHNSTON.\n\nNo. COA04-1283.\nCourt of Appeals of North Carolina.\n\nSeptember 20, 2005.\nAttorney General Roy A. Cooper, III, by Special Deputy Attorney General William P. Hart and Assistant Attorney General Caroline Farmer, for the State.\n\nJeffrey Evan Noecker, Wilmington, for defendant-appellant.\n\n*808 HUNTER, Judge.\n\nCynthia Johnston (\"defendant\") presents the following issues for our consideration: Did the trial court err by (I) failing to instruct the jury regarding an essential element of felonious damage to computers; (II) denying her motion to dismiss; and (III) entering judgment on a fatally flawed indictment. After careful review, we vacate the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for entry of judgment and sentence on the misdemeanor offense of damaging computers.\n\nThe State presented evidence at trial tending to show the following: Dr. Thomas Kirby (\"Dr. Kirby\") is an optometrist with a practice located in four cities in New Hanover, Pender, and Brunswick Counties. Dr. Kirby and two other optometrists rotated through these four locations.\n\nPrior to 1998, Dr. Kirby's insurance billing procedure consisted of completing a standardized health claim insurance form by hand and mailing the form to the insurance company via standard United States mail. In order to improve efficiency, he contracted with defendant, a representative with Island Automated Medical Systems, in February of 1998 to computerize his billing system. Defendant thereafter purchased billing software and uploaded the software onto Dr. Kirby's office computers at all four locations. As payment, defendant and Dr. Kirby agreed that defendant would receive five percent (5%) of all insurance claims received from the insurance companies. Dr. Kirby testified that the computer program software was owned by defendant. Dr. Kirby also hired defendant as his data entry processor, for which he paid defendant an hourly salary in addition to the five percent (5%) portion of the insurance claims. Defendant was responsible for filing the insurance claims.\n\nDr. Kirby's and defendant's business relationship worked well until the end of 2000, when defendant's work quality declined due to personal problems. Defendant was absent from work without explanation, and while at work she handled personal business. As a result, a backlog developed in the number of claims processed.\n\nOn 20 October 2000, Dr. Kirby had a \"counseling\" meeting with defendant, during which he discussed defendant's work quality and gave defendant several warning notices. After the meeting, defendant left Dr. Kirby's office and went to her vehicle parked outside. Before getting into her car, however, defendant \"spun around and came back in the office.\" She sat down at her desk and \"did something on the [computer] keyboard.\" Defendant then removed a box of computer diskettes from her desk and left the building. Defendant appeared to be angry and \"was mumbling something about not having to put up with this.\"\n\nDr. Kirby and two other individuals immediately checked the computer and noticed the program icon for the billing program was no longer on the computer screen. Prior to the meeting, an employee had observed the billing program up and running on the computer. Dr. Kirby testified that all of the patient and appointment information was missing. The patient information consisted of demographic data, patient demographics, names, addresses, insurance type, insurance numbers, and past claims. He testified this information was not part of defendant's software, but was stored on the hard drive. Dr. Kirby testified that the software was owned by defendant; however, the data was his property. Defendant removed the software program from the Wilmington location only. The three other locations retained the software and data.\n\n*809 As a result of defendant's removal of the software, Dr. Kirby purchased a new software program that was ultimately incompatible with his computers. Dr. Kirby purchased a new computer system and hired Patricia Payne (\"Payne\") to attempt to rebuild the lost insurance claims. Payne reviewed the patient files, spoke with patients, and re-filed several claims. Dr. Kirby agreed to pay Payne twenty percent (20%) of anything he received from her insurance filings with insurance companies. No testimony was given regarding the amount of the lost claims.\n\nDefendant presented no evidence. Upon review of the evidence, the jury found defendant guilty of damaging a computer. The trial court sentenced defendant to a suspended sentence of ten to twelve months imprisonment and placed her on supervised probation for thirty-six months. The trial court also ordered defendant to pay costs and restitution in the amount of $1,766.00. Defendant appeals.\n\nDefendant argues the trial court erred by (I) failing to instruct the jury regarding an essential element of felonious damage to a computer; (II) failing to dismiss the charge of felonious damage to a computer as there was insufficient evidence that defendant acted without authorization or that her actions amounted to alteration, damage, or destruction; and (III) entering judgment on a fatally flawed indictment.\n\nI. Jury Instructions\n\nDefendant argues the trial court erroneously failed to instruct the jury regarding an essential element of the crime of felonious damage to a computer. Specifically, defendant contends the trial court did not instruct the jury that the computer damage must exceed $1,000.00 in order to constitute a felony.\n\nAs an initial matter, we address the State's contention that this issue is not preserved for appellate review because defendant failed to object to the trial court's instruction during the charge conference or after the charge was given to the jury. Pursuant to Rule 10(b)(2) of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure:\n\nA party may not assign as error any portion of the jury charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly that to which he objects and the grounds of his objection; provided, that opportunity was given to the party to make the objection out of the hearing of the jury, and, on request of any party, out of the presence of the jury.\nN.C.R.App. P. 10(b)(2). Defendant did not object to the jury instruction in this case. Therefore, we can only review this issue for plain error. See N.C.R.App. P. 10(c)(4); State v. Odom, 307 N.C. 655, 659, 300 S.E.2d 375, 378 (1983). Defendant, however, has not alleged plain error and, therefore, this issue is not properly preserved for appellate review. See State v. Moore, 132 N.C.App. 197, 201, 511 S.E.2d 22, 25, disc. review denied, 350 N.C. 103,  525 S.E.2d 469 (1999).\n\nHowever, under Rule 2 of the Appellate Rules:\n\nTo prevent manifest injustice to a party, or to expedite decision in the public interest, either court of the appellate division may, except as otherwise expressly provided by these rules, suspend or vary the requirements or provisions of any of these rules in a case pending before it upon application of a party or upon its own initiative, and may order proceedings in accordance with its directions.\nN.C.R.App. P. 2.\n\nIn Viar v. N.C. Dep't of Transp., 359 N.C. 400, 610 S.E.2d 360 (2005), our Supreme Court stated \"[i]t is not the role of the appellate courts . . . to create an appeal for an appellant.\" Id. at 402, 610 S.E.2d at 361. In Viar, the majority opinion addressed an issue not raised or argued by the plaintiff which was the basis of the Industrial Commission's decision, namely, the reasonableness of the defendant's decision to delay installation of median barriers at a dangerous location. Id. By addressing an issue not raised by either party, the appellee did not have notice of the issue and did not address the issue in its brief. Our Supreme Court stated \"[a]s this case illustrates, the Rules of Appellate Procedure must be consistently applied; otherwise, the Rules become meaningless, and an *810 appellee is left without notice of the basis upon which an appellate court might rule.\" Id.\n\nIn this case, we choose to invoke Rule 2 upon our own initiative to \"expedite decision in the public interest\"[1] for the following reasons. First, our review of the record indicates the trial court failed to instruct on an essential element of the crime of felonious damage to computers, to wit: the damage must exceed $1,000.00. A pattern jury instruction does not exist for this statutory crime, and the lack of a pattern jury instruction may have facilitated the error in this case. Additionally, there are no cases interpreting, analyzing, citing, or explaining Article 60 \"Computer-Related Crime\" of Chapter 14 of our General Statutes. Specifically, section 14-455 of our General Statutes has never been addressed by our appellate courts. Thus, even if a trial court was inclined to fashion a jury instruction from the applicable case law, no applicable case law exists. Finally, the trial court utilized the incorrect statutory version of section 14-455 to charge the jury in this case. Notably, unlike the situation in Viar, the parties have addressed these issues in their briefs and at oral argument.\n\nWe also find that an invocation of Rule 2 is consistent with the purpose of Rule 2. Rule 2 was enacted in 1975. In explaining the rationale of Rule 2, the drafting committee included the following commentary in our appellate rules:\n\nThis Rule expresses an obvious residual power possessed by any authoritative rule-making body to suspend or vary operation of its published rules in specific cases where this is necessary to accomplish a fundamental purpose of the rules. The power does not of course depend upon its express reservation by the Court in the body of the Rules. It is included here as a reminder to counsel that the power does exist, and that it may be drawn upon by either appellate court where the justice of doing so or the injustice of failing to do so is made clear to the court. The phrase \"except as otherwise expressly provided\" refers to the provision in Rule 27(c) that the time limits for taking appeal laid down in these Rules . . . may not be extended by any court.\nN.C.R.App. P. 2, Commentary (1977). We therefore address the merits of defendant's argument in order to clarify the law of computer related crime in North Carolina. See, e.g., State v. Hudson, 345 N.C. 729, 732, 483 S.E.2d 436, 438 (1997) (stating that, \"[n]evertheless, we deny the State's request that we refuse to review the issue now. The Court of Appeals exercised its discretion pursuant to Rule 2 of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure to consider this issue; we likewise exercise our discretion pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7A-31 to review the Court of Appeals' decision so that the law pertaining to this issue in this jurisdiction will be consistent and clear\").\n\nDefendant argues the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury regarding the amount of damages. Under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-455(a) (1999), the statute in effect on 20 October 2000:\n\nIt is unlawful to willfully and without authorization alter, damage, or destroy a computer, computer system, computer network, or any part thereof. A violation of this subsection is a Class G felony if the damage caused by the alteration, damage, or destruction is more than one thousand dollars ($1000). Any other violation of this subsection is a Class 1 misdemeanor.\nId. Under this statute, if the computer damage does not exceed $1,000.00, the alleged perpetrator is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor, and not a Class G felony.\n\nIn order to convict defendant of felonious damage to a computer, the State was therefore required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury was required to so find, that the damages in this case exceeded $1,000.00. Compare N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-72(a) (2003) (providing that \"[l]arceny of goods of the value of more than one thousand *811 dollars ($1,000) is a Class H felony\"); State v. Jones, 275 N.C. 432, 436, 168 S.E.2d 380, 383 (1969) (emphasis omitted) (stating that, in order \"to convict of the felony of larceny, it is incumbent upon the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the stolen property was more than two hundred dollars [now $1,000.00]; and, value in excess of two hundred dollars being an essential element of the offense, it is incumbent upon the trial judge to so instruct the jury\"). As such, the trial court was required to instruct the jury regarding valuation of damages in excess of $1,000.00. See Jones, 275 N.C. at 436-437, 168 S.E.2d at 383 (stating that, \"[t]he basis for this requirement is the elementary proposition that the credibility of the testimony, even though unequivocal and uncontradicted, must be passed upon by the jury\").\n\nThe trial court here, however, failed to instruct the jury regarding the essential element of valuation. Absent such instruction, the jury did not fix the value of the damages as in excess of $1,000.00. Hence, the jury verdict did not establish defendant was guilty of the felony of damaging computers of a value in excess of $1,000.00. See id. (holding that, as the trial court did not instruct on the essential element of valuation for the crime of felonious larceny, the jury failed to find that the larceny of which the defendant was convicted related to property of a value of more than $200.00 (now $1,000.00), and the verdict had to therefore be considered a verdict of guilty of larceny of personal property of a value of $200.00 (now $1,000.00) or less); State v. Holloway, 265 N.C. 581, 583,  144 S.E.2d 634, 635 (1965) (holding that, where no instructions are given on value, a judgment of felonious larceny must be vacated); State v. Cooper, 256 N.C. 372, 381, 124 S.E.2d 91, 98 (1962) (same); State v. Keeter, 35 N.C.App. 574, 575, 241 S.E.2d 708, 709 (1978) (noting that \"although the judgment of felonious larceny must be vacated where no instructions were given on value, the verdict will stand, and the case is to be remanded for entering a sentence consistent with a verdict of guilty of misdemeanor larceny\").\n\nMoreover, the State presented no evidence that the damage caused by defendant to Dr. Kirby's computer exceeded $1,000.00. Neither Dr. Kirby nor Payne testified regarding the amount of any lost claims. Nor was evidence presented regarding the value of Payne's services in recovering any lost data. Although the indictment against defendant alleged economic harm in the amount of thirty thousand dollars, the State failed to introduce evidence at trial to support such a finding by the jury. We must therefore vacate defendant's judgment and remand this case for entry of judgment and sentencing on the misdemeanor of damaging computers.\n\nII. Motion to Dismiss\n\nBy further assignment of error, defendant contends the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss on the ground that the State failed to present evidence that she acted without authorization or that she damaged Dr. Kirby's computer. We disagree.\n\nDefendant contends the State failed to present evidence that she acted without authorization when she removed the software from Dr. Kirby's computer. For computer-related crimes, \"authorization\" is defined as \"having the consent or permission of the owner, or of the person licensed or authorized by the owner to grant consent or permission to access a computer, computer system, or computer network in a manner not exceeding the consent or permission.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-453(1a) (1999) (emphasis added). Defendant argues that, as the computer software belonged to her, she acted within her authority in removing it. Dr. Kirby testified, however, that defendant's actions in removing the software also resulted in a loss of all of his patient data stored on his computer's hard drive. Both the data and the computer hard drive were the property of Dr. Kirby. Although defendant was certainly authorized to access the computer, Dr. Kirby employed defendant to enter patient data onto his computer, not to delete such files. Such action clearly \"exceeded the consent or permission\" of Dr. Kirby, the owner of the computer, and thereby violated the statute. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss.\n\nDefendant also contends the State failed to prove that she damaged the computer *812 because there was no evidence that she introduced a computer virus into Dr. Kirby's computer system. The version of section 14-455 of our General Statutes in effect on 20 October 2000 provided that:\n\n(a) It is unlawful to willfully and without authorization alter, damage, or destroy a computer, computer system, computer network, or any part thereof. A violation of this subsection is a Class G felony if the damage caused by the alteration, damage, or destruction is more than one thousand dollars ($1,000). Any other violation of this subsection is a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n(b) This section applies to alteration, damage, or destruction effectuated by introducing, directly or indirectly, a computer program (including a self-replicating or a self-propagating computer program) into a computer, computer system, or computer network.\nN.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-455 (1999). Defendant contends subsection (b) of section 14-455 in effect modifies subsection (a) to limit the crime of damage to computers to damages caused by computer viruses only. This argument has no merit. As the State notes, defendant erroneously asserts that the term \"`applies to'\" means \"`is defined as.'\" Under defendant's reasoning, both subsections refer to the same crime. We agree with the State that, rather than limiting subsection (a), subsection (b) creates a new separate offense relating to a computer virus. We overrule this assignment of error.\n\nIII. Indictment\n\nFinally, defendant argues that the charges against her should have been dismissed in that the indictment against her was fatally flawed. The indictment against defendant charged she damaged computers by \"unlawfully, willfully and feloniously . . . entering a controlled computer system from an outside line without the knowledge or consent of the owner . . . for the purpose of damaging the system by deleting operational and system files causing a loss . . . of $30,000.00.\" Defendant contends the indictment nowhere alleges she \"`altere[d], damage[d] or destroy[ed]'\" a computer and that a fatal variance therefore exists between the indictment and the evidence adduced at trial. We disagree.\n\n\"An indictment charging a statutory offense must allege all of the essential elements of the offense.\" State v. Snyder, 343 N.C. 61, 65, 468 S.E.2d 221, 224 (1996).\n\n\"An indictment is sufficient in form for all intents and purposes if it expresses the charge in a plain, intelligible and explicit manner. It will not be quashed `by reasons of any informality or refinement, if[,] in the bill or proceeding, sufficient matter appears to enable the court to proceed to judgment.' [State v. Russell, 282 N.C. 240, 244, 192 S.E.2d 294, 296 (1972)]. It is generally held that the language in a statutorily prescribed form of criminal pleading is sufficient if the act or omission is clearly set forth so that a person of common understanding may know what is intended.\"\nId. at 66, 468 S.E.2d at 224 (citations omitted) (quoting State v. Coker, 312 N.C. 432, 434-35, 323 S.E.2d 343, 346 (1984)).\n\nHere, the indictment was sufficiently plain and intelligible and charged defendant with all of the essential elements of the crime of damaging computers. The indictment alleged that defendant (1) \"unlawfully, willfully and feloniously\"; (2) \"without the knowledge or consent of the owner\"; (3) \"enter[ed] a controlled computer system . . . for the purpose of damaging the system by deleting operational and system files\"; thereby (4) \"causing a loss.\" The State presented evidence at trial from which the jury could find defendant damaged Dr. Kirby's computer by deleting important patient and other data from the hard drive without authority or consent. The indictment against defendant was therefore not fatally flawed, and we overrule this assignment of error.\n\nIn conclusion, we hold the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on an essential element of the crime of felonious damage to computers. In light of our decision, we need not address defendant's remaining assignment of error. We vacate the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for entry *813 of judgment and sentence on the misdemeanor crime of damaging computers.\n\nVacated and remanded.\n\nJudges HUDSON and GEER concur.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] Because we conclude invocation of Rule 2 is in the public interest, the present case is unlike that of State v. Buchanan, ___ N.C.App. ___, ___,  613 S.E.2d 356, 358 (2005), where this Court determined that the defendant's failure to preserve any issue for appeal did not create a \"manifest injustice\" and

Jordan, for the State.\n\nPeter Wood, Raleigh, for defendant-appellant.\n\nGEER, Judge.\n\nDefendant Geraldine Lewis Ramos appeals from her conviction of damaging a computer or computer network in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-455(a) (2007). In order to obtain a conviction under that statute, the State must prove the defendant acted \"willfully.\" We agree with defendant that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that it was required to determine whether defendant deleted files on the computer willfully. Because there is a reasonable possibility that the jury might have reached a different verdict if properly instructed, we must grant defendant a new trial.\n\nFacts\n\nThe State's evidence tended to show the following facts. Defendant was hired as a community outreach coordinator by the Latin American Resource Center (\"LARC\") on 15 May 2005. Her supervisor was LARC's director and founder, Aura Camacho-Maas. At that time, LARC had three full-time employees, including Camacho-Maas and defendant, and eight part-time employees. LARC had a computer network with five computers.\n\nOne of defendant's responsibilities was to write grant proposals for the organization. One proposal was supposed to be completed by 1 August 2005. On 1 August 2005, however, the proposal was not complete, and defendant and Camacho-Maas had to work until midnight to get the proposal done.\n\nDuring the week prior to 15 August 2005, Camacho-Maas assigned defendant a second grant proposal due on 15 August 2005. The proposal required defendant to access computer files related to LARC's teacher apprenticeship program (\"TAP\"). When, on 15 August 2005, the proposal was still not completed, Camacho-Maas and defendant, who were the only employees in the office, had to work on the grant proposal together.\n\nOn that same day, Camacho-Maas told defendant that she was being terminated because she was unable to do the work required for her position. When Camacho-Maas asked defendant for her keys to the office, defendant refused to hand them over until she received her paycheck. Camacho-Maas explained to defendant that she would receive her paycheck at the end of the month as usual, and defendant left the building. Camacho-Maas followed defendant and told the receptionist that defendant had been terminated from her job and was not to enter the building without Camacho-Maas being present. The receptionist requested that Camacho-Maas send an e-mail confirming that instruction.\n\nWhile Camacho-Maas was in her office typing the e-mail, she heard noises in the lobby. When she went to see what was happening, defendant and the receptionist were coming out of defendant's office with drums defendant had brought to LARC for a summer art program. After they left, Camacho-Maas closed the door to defendant's office and went back into her own office.\n\n*360 Moments later, Camacho-Maas realized the receptionist and defendant were again coming out of defendant's office. Camacho-Maas became concerned, went into defendant's office, sat down at defendant's computer, and discovered that the TAP files were missing from LARC's server. Camacho-Maas had seen the TAP files on the server earlier that day before she had terminated defendant's employment. Only LARC employees have access to the TAP files, and Camacho-Maas had not authorized anyone to move or remove the TAP files. Camacho-Maas called the police, and Detective B.R. Williams of the Raleigh Police Department was assigned to investigate the case.\n\nOn 16 August 2005, defendant returned to LARC, and Camacho-Maas called Detective Williams. He went to LARC, met defendant, and told her why he was there. Defendant admitted that she had copied files onto her flash drive. Detective Williams asked defendant to accompany him to the police station so that he could copy the contents of the flash drive. A member of the Raleigh Police Department's cybercrimes unit found approximately 304 LARC files on defendant's flash drive, 80% of which were TAP files that were \"either deleted or deleted and overwritten.\"\n\nDefendant was charged with damaging a computer system or computer network. On 3 November 2005, defendant pled guilty in district court to damaging a computer. The trial court sentenced defendant to a suspended sentence of 45 days imprisonment and 12 months supervised probation. Defendant appealed to superior court on 7 November 2005.\n\nDuring the trial in superior court, defendant presented evidence that she had researched and developed a curriculum that cost $5,000.00 to $6,000.00\u2014a curriculum that she knew Camacho-Maas would want. Upon her termination, defendant told Camacho-Maas that she was going to delete her work off the computer. Camacho-Maas responded that defendant's work was not good and, therefore, she did not care if defendant deleted the files. Defendant testified that she never deleted the TAP files, but rather only deleted the research she had done for the curriculum and the part of the grant proposal that she had written. Defendant also testified that Camacho-Maas knew that defendant was deleting files and never said anything about what defendant was doing.\n\nThe jury found defendant guilty of damaging a computer system or computer network on 14 December 2006. The court sentenced defendant to a suspended sentence of 45 days and 18 months supervised probation. Defendant was also ordered to pay a fine in the amount of $3,107.50 and to complete 100 hours of community service. Defendant timely appealed to this Court.\n\nI\n\nDefendant first contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss. When considering a motion to dismiss, the trial court must determine whether the State presented substantial evidence of each element of the crime and of the defendant's being the perpetrator. State v. Robinson, 355 N.C. 320, 336, 561 S.E.2d 245, 255, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1006, 123 S. Ct. 488, 154 L. Ed. 2d 404 (2002). \"`Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.'\" State v. Matias, 354 N.C. 549, 552, 556 S.E.2d 269, 270 (2001) (quoting State v. Brown, 310 N.C. 563, 566, 313 S.E.2d 585, 587 (1984)). The evidence must be viewed \"in the light most favorable to the State, giving the State the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving any contradictions in its favor.\" State v. Rose, 339 N.C. 172, 192,  451 S.E.2d 211, 223 (1994), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1135, 115 S. Ct. 2565, 132 L. Ed. 2d 818 (1995).\n\nN.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-455(a), the offense charged in defendant's indictment, states: \"It is unlawful to willfully and without authorization alter, damage, or destroy a computer, computer program, computer system, computer network, or any part thereof.\" Thus, a violation of this statute requires proof: (1) that the defendant altered, damaged, or destroyed a computer, computer program, computer system, computer network, or any part thereof, (2) that the defendant *361 did so willfully, and (3) without authorization.\n\nIn this case, defendant argues only that the State presented insufficient evidence that she acted willfully. She asserts that any files deleted were her own personal property, were deleted with the permission of the director of LARC, or were accidentally deleted. Defendant's argument is, however, based solely on her own testimony. Defendant overlooks the fact that, on appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss, we look only at the State's evidence. State v. Barnett, 141 N.C.App. 378, 382-83, 540 S.E.2d 423, 427 (2000), appeal dismissed and disc. review denied in part, 353 N.C. 527, 549 S.E.2d 552, aff'd per curiam in part, 354 N.C. 350, 554 S.E.2d 644 (2001). A defendant's evidence may be considered only if it \"`explains, clarifies or is not inconsistent with the State's evidence.'\" Id. (quoting State v. Walker, 332 N.C. 520, 530, 422 S.E.2d 716, 722 (1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 919, 113 S. Ct. 2364,  124 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1993)).\n\nBecause \"willfulness\" involves a state of mind, \"`ordinarily it must be proved, if proven at all, by circumstantial evidence, that is, by proving facts from which the fact sought to be proven may be reasonably inferred.'\" State v. Alexander, 337 N.C. 182, 188, 446 S.E.2d 83, 86-87 (1994) (quoting State v. Ferguson, 261 N.C. 558, 561, 135 S.E.2d 626, 629 (1964)). In this case, the State presented evidence that when defendant's employment was terminated, she \"became enraged\" and her \"words and her body language were... very violent.\" Defendant also would not give Camacho-Maas her keys without immediately getting her paycheck. After Camacho-Maas explained that she would have to wait until the end of the month for her paycheck, defendant refused to hand over her keys and left.\n\nThe critical files were found missing from the LARC server a short while later, after defendant had returned to her office. The police discovered the missing files on defendant's flash drive with 80% of them deleted or deleted and overwritten. When questioned by the police, defendant stated that \"she would give Miss Camacho-Maas' files back when she got her paycheck.\" At trial, defendant admitted deleting LARC computer files, including curriculum files and grant-writing files, although she claimed that Camacho-Maas had given her permission to delete her \"personal files,\" which she interpreted to include work-related files.\n\nThis evidence was sufficient to allow a jury to find that defendant deleted computer files willfully. The trial court, therefore, properly denied the motion to dismiss.\n\nII\n\nDefendant next contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury as to the elements of the offense under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-455(a). Defense counsel requested in writing the following instruction:\n\nFor you to find the defendant guilty you must find that she\n1. Willfully, that is intentionally and without an honest belief that there is an excuse or justification for it[,]\n2. Without the knowledge or consent of the owner, Latin American Resource Center[,]\n3. Damaged, Altered, or Destroyed a computer, computer network, computer program, computer system or part thereof of the Latin American Resource Center[.]\nThe court denied defense counsel's requested instruction and the court submitted the following instruction to the jury:\n\nThe defendant, Geraldine Lewis Ramos, has been charged with the misdemeanor of damaging a compute [sic] system or computer network, or any part thereof.\nFor you to find the defendant guilty of this offense the State must prove two things:\nFirst, that the defendant damaged a computer system or computer network or any part thereof by deleting a file or files from the computer system or computer network.\nSecond, that the defendant did so without authorization. A person is without authorization when although the person has the consent or permission of owner [sic] to access a computer system or computer network the person does so in a *362 manner which exceeds the consent or permission.\nIf you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about August the 15th, 2005 the defendant, without authorization, damaged a computer system or computer network, it would appeal [sic] your duty to return a verdict of guilty.\nDefendant contends that the trial court's instruction was insufficient because it did not instruct the jury that it was required to find that defendant acted willfully.\n\nThe State contends that we should review the trial court's instructions to the jury under an abuse of discretion standard. The State has, however, mistakenly lumped all jury instruction issues under one standard of review. Our appellate courts have repeatedly held that \"[a] trial judge is required by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1231 and N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1232 to instruct the jury on the law arising on the evidence. This includes instruction on the elements of the crime.\" State v. Bogle, 324 N.C. 190, 195, 376 S.E.2d 745, 748 (1989) (emphasis added). See also State v. Gooch, 307 N.C. 253, 256, 297 S.E.2d 599, 601 (1982) (\"The trial court must charge the essential elements of the offense.\"); State v. Jarrett, 137 N.C.App. 256, 265, 527 S.E.2d 693, 699 (\"The trial court is required to instruct the jury as to the essential elements of the offense charged and when the court undertakes to define the law, it must do so correctly.\"), disc. review denied, 352 N.C. 152, 544 S.E.2d 233 (2000).\n\nThe appellate courts have recognized that a trial judge has discretion in the manner in which he charges the jury, \"`but he must explain every essential element of the offense charged.'\" State v. Valladares, 165 N.C.App. 598, 607, 599 S.E.2d 79, 86 (emphasis added) (quoting State v. Young, 16 N.C.App. 101, 106,  191 S.E.2d 369, 373 (1972)), appeal dismissed and disc. review denied, 359 N.C. 196, 608 S.E.2d 66 (2004). See also State v. Holmes, 120 N.C.App. 54, 71, 460 S.E.2d 915, 925 (\"While the court must explain each essential element of the offense charged, the manner in which it chooses to do so is within its discretion.\"), disc. review denied, 342 N.C. 416, 465 S.E.2d 545 (1995). This Court distinguished the aspects of jury instructions subject to discretion from those that are mandatory in State v. Wallace, 104 N.C.App. 498, 504, 410 S.E.2d 226, 230 (1991) (internal citations omitted), appeal dismissed and disc. review denied, 331 N.C. 290, 416 S.E.2d 398, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 915, 113 S. Ct. 321, 121 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1992):\n\nIn North Carolina, a trial judge is not required to follow any particular form in giving instructions and has wide discretion in presenting the issues to the jury. A judge is not required to state, summarize, or recapitulate the evidence, or to explain the application of the law to the evidence, although he may elect to do so in his discretion. A trial judge must, however, charge every essential element of the offense.\nIn short, if \"willfulness\" is an element of an offense under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-455(a), then the trial court was required to include \"willfulness\" in its instructions.\n\nThe State does not dispute either that willfulness is an element of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-455(a) or that the trial court's instruction failed to instruct the jury that defendant must have acted willfully. The State, however, contends that no error occurred because the trial court instructed the jury that defendant must have acted \"without authorization.\" According to the State, \"without authorization\" and \"willfully\" are synonymous concepts. We cannot agree.\n\nOur General Assembly defined \"authorization\" for purposes of computer-related crimes, including N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-455(a), as meaning \"having the consent or permission of the owner, or of the person licensed or authorized by the owner to grant consent or permission to access a computer, computer system, or computer network in a manner not exceeding the consent or permission.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-453(1a) (2007). As a result, a person acts \"without authorization\" if she accesses a computer without the consent or permission of the owner or in a manner exceeding any consent or permission. On the other hand, \"`[w]ilful' as used in criminal statutes means the wrongful doing of an act without justification or excuse, or *363 the commission of an act purposely and deliberately in violation of law.\" State v. Arnold, 264 N.C. 348, 349, 141 S.E.2d 473, 474 (1965). One may act \"without authorization,\" but still not act willfully. For example, a person who accidentally deletes files is not acting willfully, but has deleted the files without authorization.\n\nConsequently, the trial court's instruction that the jury was required to find that defendant acted \"without authorization\" did not satisfy the requirement that the jury be instructed as to willfulness. A contrary interpretation of the statute would be inconsistent with established principles of statutory construction:\n\n\"[W]e are guided by the principle of statutory construction that a statute should not be interpreted in a manner which would render any of its words superfluous. We construe each word of a statute to have meaning, where reasonable and consistent with the entire statute, because it is always presumed that the legislature acted with care and deliberation.\"\nState v. Haddock, ___ N.C.App. ___, ___, 664 S.E.2d 339, 345 (2008) (quoting State v. Coffey, 336 N.C. 412, 417-18, 444 S.E.2d 431, 434 (1994)). The State's contention would require that we view either \"willfully\" or \"without authorization\" as redundant or surplusage. A more reasonable construction of the statute\u2014especially given the plain meaning of the words\u2014is that the General Assembly intended to require proof both of willfulness and lack of authorization. See Porsh Builders, Inc. v. City of Winston-Salem, 302 N.C. 550, 556, 276 S.E.2d 443, 447 (1981) (\"It is presumed that the legislature intended each portion to be given full effect and did not intend any provision to be mere surplusage.\").\n\nWhen a trial court fails to instruct a jury that the State was required to prove willfulness as an element of a crime, the court has erred. See State v. Maxwell, 47 N.C.App. 658, 660, 267 S.E.2d 582, 584 (holding that trial court \"should have charged on willfulness as an element\"), appeal dismissed and disc. review denied, 301 N.C. 102, 273 S.E.2d 307 (1980). \"Ordinarily, failure to instruct on each element of a crime is prejudicial error requiring a new trial.\" State v. Whiteley, 172 N.C.App. 772, 780, 616 S.E.2d 576, 581 (2005). Nevertheless, a failure to instruct on willfulness may amount to harmless error. See State v. Rose, 53 N.C.App. 608, 611, 281 S.E.2d 404, 406 (1981) (finding no prejudice when court failed to instruct jury that defendant's escape from prison must have been willful because \"nothing in the record in any way indicates that defendant's escape was anything other than `willful'\"); Maxwell, 47 N.C.App. at 660, 267 S.E.2d at 584 (finding no prejudice because \"all the evidence shows that if defendant took indecent liberties with the child he did so willfully\").\n\nIn arguing that defendant was not prejudiced by any error, the State argues that \"defendant admitted she deleted LARC's computer files.\" It is, however, well established that a showing that an act was intentional is not the same as a showing that the act was willful. As this Court explained in State v. Whittle, 118 N.C.App. 130, 135, 454 S.E.2d 688, 691 (1995) (quoting State v. Stephenson, 218 N.C. 258, 264, 10 S.E.2d 819, 823 (1940)), \"[t]he word `willfully' means `something more than an intention to commit the offense.' ... `It implies committing the offense purposely and designedly in violation of law.'\" See also State v. Clifton, 152 N.C. 800, 802, 67 S.E. 751, 752 (1910) (\"The word willful as used within the meaning of the statute implies something more than a mere voluntary purpose. When used in criminal statutes the word willful means not only designedly, but also with a `bad purpose.'\"); Glenn-Robinson v. Acker, 140 N.C.App. 606, 619, 538 S.E.2d 601, 611 (2000) (holding that when statute requires willfulness, word \"willfully\" means more than intention to commit offense), appeal dismissed and disc. review denied, 353 N.C. 372, 547 S.E.2d 811 (2001).\n\nHere, defendant presented evidence that she believed Camacho-Maas had authorized her to delete files amounting to her own work. Defendant testified that, at the time of her termination, defendant told Camacho-Maas, \"since my work is no good I guess you won't mind if I take my work off computer [sic].\" According to defendant, Camacho-Maas responded, \"this was no consequence to *364 her, that the work was not good, and it was no consequence.\" Defendant testified that Camacho-Maas followed defendant into her office while defendant was deleting the files. Defendant testified Camacho-Maas \"didn't say anything, but she knew what I was doing at that time, reason [sic] I walked back down to the room.\" Defendant claimed that the only files that she deleted were:\n\n[t]he curriculum, research that I had done for the curriculum. I deleted part of the grant which was the grant that I had written. I think that was about three, three files, but it was not the TAP file.\nTAP file was in the server. It was a server and, in order for, to go into the server. She had already worked in the server, so I could not [sic] to go into the TAP file.\nI would have [sic] go into the server. Server couldn't be but one person going into it at the time, so I don't know.\nBased on this testimony, the jury could reasonably find that defendant intended only to delete files that she believed\u2014 according to the State, incorrectly\u2014Camacho-Maas had consented to her deleting. As our Supreme Court has held, \"[n]either does one `willfully and knowingly' violate a statute when he does that which he believes he has a bona fide right to do.\" State v. Fraylon, 240 N.C. 365, 373, 82 S.E.2d 400, 405 (1954). A jury could further find, based on defendant's testimony that she did not intend to delete the TAP files and did not believe she could enter the TAP files while Camacho-Maas was working on them, that any deletion of the files was accidental. Thus, the record contains evidence that would allow a jury to find that she deleted files without authorization, but not willfully. The trial court's failure to include willfulness in its instructions cannot, therefore, be deemed harmless error.\n\nAccordingly, defendant is entitled to a new trial. Because of our disposition of this appeal, we need not address defendant's remaining contentions.\n\nNew trial.\n\nJudge STROUD concurs.\n\nJudge TYSON concurs in part and dissents in part in a separate opinion.\n\nTYSON, Judge concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nI fully concur with that portion of the majority's opinion affirming the trial court's denial of Geraldine Lewis Ramos's (\"defendant\") motion to dismiss based upon the sufficiency of the evidence. Although the trial court failed to instruct the jury that the State was required to prove the element of willfulness, defendant failed to show any prejudice by this omission and is not entitled to a new trial. I disagree with that portion of the majority's opinion granting defendant a new trial based upon the instructions submitted to the jury. I respectfully dissent.\n\nI. Standard of Review\n\nThis Court reviews jury instructions contextually and in its entirety. The charge will be held to be sufficient if \"it presents the law of the case in such manner as to leave no reasonable cause to believe the jury was misled or misinformed....\" The party asserting error bears the burden of showing that the jury was misled or that the verdict was affected by [the] instruction. \"Under such a standard of review, it is not enough for the appealing party to show that error occurred in the jury instructions; rather, it must be demonstrated that such error was likely, in light of the entire charge, to mislead the jury.\"\nState v. Blizzard, 169 N.C.App. 285, 296-97, 610 S.E.2d 245, 253 (2005) (quoting Bass v. Johnson, 149 N.C.App. 152, 160, 560 S.E.2d 841, 847 (2002)) (emphasis supplied).\n\nII. Analysis\n\nThe majority's opinion holds the trial court committed reversible error and awards defendant a new trial because the trial court failed to instruct the jury that the State was required to prove that defendant \"willfully\" deleted the files off of LRAC's computer network. I disagree.\n\nIt is well-established that a trial judge is required to instruct the jury on every essential element of the crime charged. State v. *365 Mundy, 265 N.C. 528, 529, 144 S.E.2d 572, 573 (1965); State v. Hunt, 339 N.C. 622, 649, 457 S.E.2d 276, 292 (1994). Here, defendant was charged and convicted of a violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-455, which provides:\n\nIt is unlawful to willfully and without authorization alter, damage, or destroy a computer, computer program, computer system, computer network, or any part thereof. A violation of this subsection is a Class G felony if the damage caused by the alteration, damage, or destruction is more than one thousand dollars ($1,000). Any other violation of this subsection is a Class 1 misdemeanor.\nN.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-455(a) (2005) (emphasis supplied). The trial court correctly instructed the jury on the element of \"without authorization[,]\" but failed to instruct the jury on willfulness. Based upon principles of statutory interpretation and contrary to the State's contention, the terms \"willfully\" and \"without authorization\" are not interchangeable. See Lithium Corp. of Am. v. Town of Bessemer City, 261 N.C. 532, 535, 135 S.E.2d 574, 577 (1964) (\"Ordinarily, when the conjunctive \"and\" connects words, phrases or clauses of a statutory sentence, they are to be considered jointly.\" (Citation omitted)).\n\nThe majority's opinion correctly points out that the failure to instruct the jury on the element of willfulness has been repeatedly held to be harmless error. See State v. Rose, 53 N.C.App. 608, 611, 281 S.E.2d 404, 406 (1981); State v. Maxwell, 47 N.C.App. 658, 660-61, 267 S.E.2d 582, 584, disc. rev. denied, 301 N.C. 102, 273 S.E.2d 307 (1980). Here, our task is to determine whether the trial court's error prejudiced defendant to entitle her to a new trial. See N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443(a) (2005) (\"A defendant is prejudiced by errors relating to rights arising other than under the Constitution of the United States when there is a reasonable possibility that, had the error in question not been committed, a different result would have been reached at the trial out of which the appeal arises. The burden of showing such prejudice under this subsection is upon the defendant.\" (Emphasis supplied)).\n\nAlthough defendant presented evidence tending to show that her supervisor, Aura Camacho-Mass (\"Camacho-Mass\"), had authorized defendant to delete her personal files from LRAC's computer, other overwhelming evidence shows that defendant's actions were unequivocally willful. At trial, Camacho-Mass recounted the events which took place after she had informed defendant of her termination. Camacho-Mass testified defendant \"became enraged. Her words and her body language were, were [sic] very violent. And she was crying in my office after she told me many things.\" Camacho-Mass further testified that defendant stated she \"was a fake\" and that \"she'll destroy me in the agency.\" Defendant refused to return her office keys and immediately demanded her paycheck. Camacho-Mass informed defendant that she would receive her paycheck at the end of the month. After defendant left the building, Camacho-Mass informed the receptionist that defendant was not to be allowed to re-enter the building without her presence.\n\nShortly thereafter, Camacho-Mass heard noises outside her office and observed defendant and the receptionist exit defendant's office carrying drums that were used in the agency's summer program. Camacho-Mass testified she refrained from commenting on defendant's presence because she believed the drums belonged to defendant.\n\nCamacho-Mass subsequently observed defendant and the receptionist exit defendant's office a second time and became \"really concerned.\" Camacho-Mass sat down at defendant's computer, opened up the file server, and discovered that all the Teacher Apprenticeship Program (\"TAP\") files had been deleted from the agency's computer network. Camacho-Mass reported defendant's actions to the police. Camacho-Mass testified that neither defendant nor other personnel had permission to duplicate or remove the TAP files from LRAC's network.\n\nRaleigh Police Detective James Neville (\"Detective Neville\") of the cyber crimes unit, confirmed that 304 files were stored on LRAC's flash drive and approximately 80 percent of these files were either deleted or overwritten.\n\n*366 The following day, defendant returned to her former workplace and met with Detective B.R. Williams to discuss the missing files. Defendant admitted she had copied the files onto her personal thumb drive \"because they [were] her work.\" However, defendant also stated \"she would give Miss Camacho-Mass' files back when she got her paycheck.\"\n\nThe jury also heard additional evidence regarding defendant's actions after this incident occurred. Defendant sent a \"very incriminating letter\" to all of the board members implying that Camacho-Mass had engaged in \"racial behavior\" and was misappropriating agency funds. Defendant's demeanor, her threat that she would \"destroy\" Camacho-Mass, her refusal to surrender her keys after termination, and her repeated returns to her former office after termination, the circumstances surrounding the deletion of the files, and defendant's statement that she had copied the files and would give the files back when \"she got her paycheck\" unequivocally show defendant's actions in duplicating and removing the files was willful. Based upon the preceding evidence, no reasonable probability exists that a different result would have been reached at trial if the trial court had instructed the jury on the element of willfulness. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443.\n\nDefendant has failed to show she was prejudiced by the trial court's jury instructions and is not entitled to a new trial. Because I would hold that defendant is not entitled to a new trial on this issue, I address defendant's remaining assignment of error.\n\nIII. Sentencing\n\nDefendant argues the trial court erred by sentencing her to a \"harsher sentence\" than she received in the district court.\n\nA sentence within statutory limits is presumed to be regular. Where the record, however, reveals the trial court considered an improper matter in determining the severity of the sentence, the presumption of regularity is overcome. It is improper for the trial court, in sentencing a defendant, to consider the defendant's decision to insist on a jury trial. Where it can be reasonably inferred the sentence imposed on a defendant was based, even in part, on the defendant's insistence on a jury trial, the defendant is entitled to a new sentencing hearing.\nState v. Peterson, 154 N.C.App. 515, 517, 571 S.E.2d 883, 885 (2002) (internal citation and quotation omitted). In district court, defendant was sentenced to a suspended sentence of forty-five days imprisonment and was placed on supervised probation for a period of twelve months. Defendant appealed to the superior court and asserted her right to a jury trial.\n\nAfter the jury had returned a guilty verdict, the superior court imposed a suspended sentence of forty-five days imprisonment and placed defendant on supervised probation for a period of eighteen months. It is undisputed that the suspended sentence defendant received in superior court was authorized by statute, rested in the presumptive range, and was identical to the suspended sentence she received in district court. Before the superior court judge imposed defendant's sentence, he stated:\n\nI hope that your counsel told you, as he should have, that I am not bound to do what that district court judge did, and likely to do that, because up here we don't do that.\nThey generally give minimum sentences down in district court. But any, any [sic] person who appeals a minimum sentence of the district court, thinks [they are] going to get a better result that you got get [sic] from those people is a fool.\nAny lawyer who tells someone to take up an appeal of a minimum sentence out of district court is equally unwise.\nDefendant argues the preceding statements are evidence that her sentence was based on irrelevant and improper matters. I disagree. Nothing in the trial court's comments reveals it considered an improper matter in determining the severity of defendant's sentence or referred to her \"insistence on a jury trial.\" Id. The trial court imposed the same suspended sentence defendant had received in district court. I vote to overrule this assignment of error.\n\n*367 IV. Conclusion\n\nThe trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss. The trial court failed to instruct the jury on the element of willfulness contained in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-455. However, the totality of the evidence presented at trial shows defendant's actions in copying the files to her personal thumb drive and deleting the files off of LRAC's network were unequivocally unlawful and done \"willfully\" and without authorization. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443. Defendant has failed to show she was prejudiced by the trial court's erroneous jury instruction and is not entitled to a new trial.\n\nNothing in the record supports a reasonable inference that the trial court considered \"improper matter[s]\" in sentencing defendant or that \"the sentence imposed on [] defendant was based, even in part, on [] defendant's insistence on a jury trial[.]\" Peterson, 154 N.C.App. at 517, 571 S.E.2d at 885. Defendant received a fair trial, free from prejudicial errors she preserved, assigned, and argued.

Christine Manuelian, Assistant United States Attorney, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Baltimore, Maryland, for Appellee. ON BRIEF: Rod J. Rosenstein, United States Attorney, Baltimore, Maryland, for Appellee.\n\nBefore NIEMEYER, MICHAEL, and GREGORY, Circuit Judges.\n\nDismissed in part; affirmed in part by published opinion. Judge GREGORY wrote the opinion, in which Judge NIEMEYER and Judge MICHAEL concurred.\n\nOPINION\n\nGREGORY, Circuit Judge:\n\n1\nByron Allen and Ernest Reinhardt (\"Appellants\") appeal, on various grounds, their convictions for wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (2000). Additionally, Reinhardt raises numerous issues concerning his seventy-month sentence. Because the district court did not commit reversible error, we affirm the Appellants' convictions and sentences.\n\nI.\n\n2\nAllen and Reinhardt were indicted on multiple counts of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 arising from their involvement in a scheme that arranged equipment financing for nonexistent equipment. In short, Reinhardt's company, Tech Com, acting as a purported equipment vendor, would arrange, through financing companies, equipment-lease financing for various customers. Reinhardt would take a portion of the loan as a fee and the lessee would keep the remainder. Neither Reinhardt nor his company would provide the lessees with computer equipment. The Government, through prior indictments, secured guilty pleas from eleven other individuals involved in the scheme. A twelfth individual was indicted along with the Appellants but pleaded guilty shortly after trial commenced.\n\nA.\n\n3\nAt trial, the Government presented evidence that Reinhardt was the major architect of the fraud scheme, while Allen assisted in the scheme through preparing and faxing fraudulent documents. Six other participants in the scheme testified; all six gave similar testimony about the logistics of the scheme, Reinhardt's leadership role, and Allen's involvement.\n\n4\nLinda Durkin testified that she was told that Reinhardt could arrange loans through Tech Com, at a cost of twenty percent, to provide needed capital for her mortgage business. Prior to the transaction, Reinhardt told Durkin that the loan was actually an equipment lease for new computers, but that she could use her existing computers as collateral and did not have to provide any documentation as to their value. Throughout her relationship with Reinhardt, Durkin never received any computer equipment\u2014new or used\u2014from Reinhardt or Tech Com. Durkin expressed her concerns about the arrangement and Reinhardt assured her that it was legal, but that the leasing companies \"don't really like it.\" J.A. 5267.\n\n5\nReinhardt instructed her to tell the financing company that she received new equipment when the company called for verbal verification. Durkin testified that Reinhardt told her: \"That if they [the financing company] ask if there's new equipment, yes, it's new equipment. Tell them\u2014you know, tell them it's been installed. If they ask if it's been installed, delivered, you say yes.\" J.A. 5272. Reinhardt told Durkin when the financing company was going to conduct an on-site inspection. Prior to the inspection, Reinhardt shipped Durkin labels with serial numbers printed on them that she affixed to her existing computer equipment. The serial numbers did not match those on the actual equipment; instead they matched the numbers on the form for the particular lease.\n\n6\nDurkin's account accorded with that of the other witnesses. Clint Garrison and Paul Gregg testified that Reinhardt offered to arrange loans for their financial consulting company for a twenty percent fee. Gregg and Garrison entered into five lease transactions with Reinhardt. Neither Reinhardt nor Tech Com provided any of the computer equipment referenced in the lease documents. Rather, Reinhardt told Garrison to purchase a label gun to manufacture labels with false serial numbers on them and affix those labels to computer equipment prior to a physical inspection. In addition to transactions for their own company, Garrison and Gregg also arranged leases through Reinhardt for two other companies with which they were involved. None of these companies received computer equipment through the leases from Reinhardt or any of his associates or associated entities. Reinhardt was the contact person on all of these leases.\n\n7\nLikewise, Tigran Khrlobian was introduced to Reinhardt because he needed to raise capital for his insurance agency, Proshield, which had recently emerged from bankruptcy. When he first met with Reinhardt, Reinhardt explained that Khrlobian's company could enter into computer leases and receive money, rather than equipment. Khrlobian entered into at least seven lease transactions through Reinhardt, with Tech Com acting as the purported equipment vendor. He never permanently received any of the computer equipment represented in the leases. When the financing company performed an on-site inspection, Reinhardt brought Khrlobian equipment, used a label maker to affix serial numbers to the devices, and then removed the equipment shortly after the inspection. Reinhardt coached Khrlobian to respond to telephone inquiries from the financing companies by saying that the equipment was there and that Khrlobian was happy with it.\n\n8\nJacques Smith testified that he started a debt collection business, CRU & Associates, with coconspirator Marc Washington. Smith and Washington were introduced to Reinhardt, who promised that he could arrange for two $50,000 loans to CRU. Smith and Washington had bad credit, but filled out a loan application sent by Reinhardt using Washington's grandmother as the applicant (with her permission).\n\n9\nReinhardt then informed Smith that the loan would not be approved without CRU having a Dun & Bradstreet (\"D & B\") report. Smith filled out a basic D & B report for CRU, but the bank was not satisfied and wanted a full D & B report. Smith then filled out a full D & B report, in which he provided a false reference supplied by Reinhardt. Reinhardt told Smith that the bank wanted audited financial statements for the company but that he had contacts in California who could provide financial reports for CRU for $600 to $1,000. Smith and Washington ordered the reports, which arrived two or three days later. Smith and Washington had never provided Reinhardt with any financial information about CRU; the reports they purchased were completely fabricated.\n\n10\nWhen Reinhardt forwarded Smith the final loan documents that needed to be signed by Washington's grandmother, Smith realized that the loan was actually in the form of a lease for computers. Neither Smith, Washington, nor CRU ever requested or received computer equipment in connection with the loan. Reinhardt told Smith that when the financing company called to ask about the equipment, that Smith should tell them that CRU had received new computer equipment. This first lease transaction yielded CRU around $30,000. The second loan that Smith arranged through Reinhardt required an on-site inspection. Reinhardt faxed Smith a list of serial numbers to affix to the back of CRU's existing computer equipment.\n\n11\nReinhardt instructed Smith that CRU needed to make at least the first two to four monthly payments on the lease transactions to avoid suspicion of fraud. Reinhardt told Washington that if he made a minimum of six or seven payments on the loan, it would not be red-flagged. After those payments, Reinhardt informed Washington that he could \"utilize the insurance that also comes with the leases, and report, act like you had a break-in at your establishment and report the computers stolen to get out of the lease.\" J.A. 2965.\n\n12\nAfter a dispute, Smith ended his relationship with Reinhardt and Washington. Washington testified that he then formed his own corporation, Futureview Graphics, which he and Reinhardt used as a lessee in two fraudulent leases. Washington also generated numerous lessees through his friends, using their existing businesses or assisting them in creating new ones. Reinhardt represented Tech Com as the vendor on all of these transactions. Reinhardt took fees of ten to twenty percent on these leases, then Washington took fees and provided the remainder to the lessees. Washington often set up computers at business locations for on-site inspections by finance companies. Reinhardt faxed Washington a list of serial numbers, so that Washington could affix those numbers to the computers. Washington removed the computers after the inspections were complete.\n\n13\nThe father of Washington's girlfriend was listed as a guarantor for some of the lease transactions for lessee Variety Cutz and was falsely listed as the president of the company. Washington testified that he joked to Reinhardt about the ownership of Variety Cutz and that Reinhardt compared it to Washington's grandmother nominally owning CRU, because Washington had used her credit. Reinhardt's knowledge of the Variety Cutz arrangement was demonstrated by his threats to Washington's girlfriend that he would \"let it be known that [she and Washington] used her father's information.\" J.A. 3058.\n\n14\nA representative of CIT, which financed seven of Tech Com's leases, testified that the invoice provided by the vendor is the title to the equipment and represents the bill of sale. CIT would not have approved loans if they knew that the equipment in the invoice had never been sold or delivered. If the money from the loan flowed to the lessee rather than the vendor, it would have raised a red flag as a violation of the agreements, which purported to be equipment-financing leases. The seven leases with Tech Com were not sale-leaseback arrangements and were supposed to be for purchase of new equipment. If Tech Com had wanted to finance sale-leasebacks from CIT, there would have been different paperwork evidencing ownership and title to the underlying equipment as well as its value. If Tech Com wanted working capital loans, there would have been proof-of-ownership and UCC documents.\n\n15\nRepresentatives of other financing companies testified to the same material facts. For example, a representative of Alliance Capital testified that he dealt with Reinhardt and Allen at Tech Com and that he understood Reinhardt to be the manager and Allen to be in sales. Alliance would not have engaged in any of the lease transactions with Tech Com if they were aware that there was no actual computer equipment.\n\n16\nWith respect to Allen, Washington testified that Allen was a sales processor at Tech Com. When Washington submitted a lease-transaction application to Tech Com, Allen was one of the processors who called the customers and verified information before submitting the application to the financing company. Allen assisted with some twenty of the lease transactions that Washington and Reinhardt conducted following the creation of Futureview Graphics. Reinhardt told Washington that Allen received commission payments on the transactions with which he assisted. Allen received approximately $19,930 in payments from Tech Com. Allen worked from Reinhardt's office at Tech Com, where a fax machine was located. Numerous fax cover sheets were entered into evidence that had Allen's name on them and referenced lease agreements between Tech Com and various companies. These cover sheets all accompanied invoices or other documents related to the fraudulent lease transactions.\n\n17\nThe jury found Reinhardt guilty of twenty-nine counts of wire fraud and Allen guilty of six counts of wire fraud. The jury could not reach a verdict on one count of wire fraud for both defendants and on one count with which only Allen was charged. After a three-day sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced Reinhardt to seventy months in prison and Allen to thirty-seven months. This appeal followed.\n\nII.\n\n18\nReinhardt and Allen allege that there was insufficient evidence to sustain their convictions and that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the mens rea requirement of wire fraud. They argue that the evidence did not establish that either engaged in wire fraud because Washington was the architect of the scheme and they were unknowing participants. In addition, they claim that the evidence did not establish that either possessed the requisite mens rea to commit fraud because they believed that the leases would be paid back to the financing companies. Finally, they assert that an error in a jury instruction misstated the law and allowed the jury to convict with less than the required quantum of evidence of fraudulent intent.\n\n19\nIn evaluating a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence for conviction, \"this Court must determine whether, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, any reasonable trier of fact could have found [the defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" United States v. Curry, 461 F.3d 452, 457 (4th Cir.2006). In our inquiry, the Government is given \"the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\" United States v. Tresvant, 677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir. 1982). Accordingly, \"if the record reflects that the Government presented substantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could convict, we must uphold the verdict.\" United States v. Godwin, 272 F.3d 659, 666 (4th Cir.2001). Moreover, \"[w]here there are conflicts in the testimony, it is for the jury and not the appellate court to weigh the evidence and judge the credibility of the witnesses.\" Curry, 461 F.3d at 457 (alteration in original) (quoting Tresvant, 677 F.2d at 1021).\n\nA.\n\n20\nWhen viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, there is ample evidence to sustain the convictions of both Reinhardt and Allen. Wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 has \"two essential elements: (1) the existence of a scheme to defraud and (2) the use of . . . wire communication in furtherance of that scheme.\" Curry, 461 F.3d at 457. The evidence adduced at trial supports the jury verdict that Allen and Reinhardt engaged in conduct satisfying both elements of the charged offense and that both had the requisite mental state, including intent to defraud, required under the statute. Thus, we reject Appellants' sufficiency of the evidence claim and sustain the jury verdict.\n\n21\nAllen and Reinhardt argue that they were not the principals in the fraud scheme and that Washington was the scheme's mastermind. The evidence presented at trial demonstrates that both Appellants engaged in conduct that satisfies the wire fraud statute. Furthermore, Reinhardt's attempt to portray himself as a victim of Washington does not comport with the weight of the evidence. Five witnesses testified that it was Reinhardt, not Washington, who was the principal architect of the fraudulent scheme. Durkin, Gregg, Garrison, Khrlobian, and Smith all testified that they dealt with Reinhardt in securing financing from lease transactions, that they never received any computer equipment in connection with those transactions, and that Reinhardt told them to make the first few payments on the leases to avoid raising the suspicion of the financing companies. In addition, Reinhardt instructed each of them to represent to the financing companies that they had received new equipment, sometimes going so far as to bring that equipment to their businesses for on-site inspections and removing the equipment after completion of the inspection. The financing companies testified as to their extensive dealings with Reinhardt, whom they believed was in charge at Tech Com and his other companies, and that they never would have provided financing for any lease transactions involving Reinhardt if they were aware that no new computer equipment was being provided to the lessees.\n\n22\nThe evidence also demonstrates that Allen participated in the lease transactions, working out of Reinhardt's office, faxing documents, and processing leases by phone. Allen's name appears on the fax cover sheet of numerous faxes containing false invoices in connection with lease transactions. Allen received commission payments from these transactions and was aware that Tech Com was not providing equipment in connection with the leases. Indeed, Allen accompanied Reinhardt on trips to temporarily set up computer equipment with false serial numbers for on-site inspections. Given this evidence, the jury was not unreasonable in concluding that Allen was a full participant in the fraudulent scheme when he interacted with Reinhardt, customers, and financing companies in connection with transactions concerning equipment he knew not to exist.\n\n23\nIn sum, overwhelming evidence was adduced at trial to support the convictions of both Reinhardt and Allen on wire fraud and aiding and abetting wire fraud. Contrary to Reinhardt's contention on appeal, he was not Washington's innocent victim, but a full participant in the fraud scheme, instructing other coconspirators on the methodology of the fraud and serving as a chief contact to financing companies. Contrary to Allen's contentions, there is ample evidence that he faxed fraudulent documents and assisted in completing lease transactions for computers that he knew did not exist. Allen cannot feign ignorance of the scheme simply because he did not participate to the extent of Washington or Reinhardt.\n\nB.\n\n24\n\"The intent to repay eventually is irrelevant to the question of guilt for fraud.\" Curry, 461 F.3d at 458; see United States v. Kenrick, 221 F.3d 19, 29 (1st Cir.2000) (en banc) (\"[T]he intent element of bank fraud . . . is an intent to deceive the bank in order to obtain from it money or other property. `Intent to harm' is not required.\" (footnote omitted)); United States v. Hollis, 971 F.2d 1441, 1452 (10th Cir. 1992) (\"[I]f a defendant knowingly provided materially false information in order to induce the loan, [bank fraud] is complete, and it is irrelevant whether or not he intended to repay it or was capable of repaying it.\"); see also United States v. Bivins, 104 Fed.Appx. 892, 902-03 (4th Cir.2004) (affirming trial court's refusal to instruct jury based on defendant's theory that he \"never intended to cause financial harm or loss to any financial institution because he believed [a coconspirator] would pay back all of the secured loans\").\n\n25\nAccordingly, Appellants cannot rely on a belief that the customers for whom they arranged false computer equipment leases from financing companies were going to pay the loans in full. This argument is especially dubious given the evidence that Reinhardt instructed customers on the number of payments to make to avoid being red-flagged, provided false serial numbers to be affixed to equipment to deceive financing company inspectors, and told customers to inform the financing companies that the equipment was new and satisfactory, when, in fact, it did not exist. These actions are sufficient to establish the necessary mens rea for wire fraud. Cf. United States v. Godwin, 272 F.3d 659, 669-70 (4th Cir.2001) (\"The jury was also entitled to conclude that the partial reimbursements to the initial investors were meant to dispel investor concerns, to quiet what are commonly referred to as `squeaky wheels,' to keep investigators away from the scheme, and, in sum, to permit the fraud scheme to be perpetrated.\"); United States v. Painter, 314 F.2d 939, 943 (4th Cir.1963) (noting that lulling payments do not establish good faith as they are intended to conceal the fraud and \"ensnare\" other victims).\n\nC.\n\n26\n\"The decision to give or not to give a jury instruction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\" United States v. Moye, 454 F.3d 390, 397-98 (4th Cir.2006). Whether the district court has properly instructed a jury on the statutory elements of an offense is a legal question that we review de novo. United States v. Rahman, 83 F.3d 89, 92 (4th Cir.1996). \"However, in reviewing the propriety of jury instructions, we do not view a single instruction in isolation; rather we consider whether taken as a whole and in the context of the entire charge, the instructions accurately and fairly state the controlling law.\" Id. We will not vacate a conviction on the basis of an erroneous jury charge if, in light of the above inquiry, the charge contained an adequate statement of the law and was not misleading. United States v. Scott, 424 F.3d 431, 434 (4th Cir.2005).\n\n27\nReinhardt and Allen complain that the district court omitted a clause from a written jury instruction (\"Instruction 40\") provided to the jury after they commenced deliberations, and thus that the instruction was erroneous. The district court instructed the jury orally:\n\n28\nYou are instructed that if the defendant participated in the scheme to defraud, then a belief by the defendant, if such belief existed, that ultimately everything will work out so that no one would lose any money does not require a finding by you that the defendant acted in good faith.\n\n29\nIf the defendant participated in the scheme for the purpose of causing some financial or property loss to another, then no amount of honest belief on the part of the defendant that the scheme would not cause a loss, or would excuse fraudulent actions or false representations by him.\n\n30\nA defendant's belief that the victim of the fraud will be paid in the future or will sustain no economic loss is no defense to the crimes charged in the indictment.\n\n31\nJ.A. 4751-52 (emphasis added). When the district court gave the above instruction to the jury in written form as Instruction 40, the middle paragraph was omitted. Reinhardt and Allen contend that the omission of the phrase \"for the purpose of causing some financial or property loss to another\" misstated the law and allowed the jury to convict even if there was not sufficient evidence that they possessed intent to defraud.\n\n32\nInstruction 40, although omitting a clause, did not misstate the controlling law or mislead the jury as to the elements of the offense. First, when the district court orally instructed the jury on the portion of the charge later contained within written Instruction 40, the phrase \"for the purpose of causing some financial or property loss to another\" was included. More importantly, Instruction 40 advised, in the paragraph following the omitted language:\n\n33\n[I]n order to sustain the charges against the defendant, the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that his conduct as a participant in the scheme was calculated to deceive and, nonetheless, he associated himself with the alleged fraudulent scheme for the purpose of causing some loss to another.\n\n34\nJ.A. 5318 (emphasis added). On the first page of the written instruction, intent to defraud is defined as \"to act knowingly and with the specific intent to deceive, for the purposes of causing some financial or property loss to another.\" J.A. 5316. If the jury found that the defendant lacked that specific intent to defraud, the instruction counseled an acquittal.\n\n35\nFurthermore, as the district court recounted during sentencing, the jury instructions as a whole repeatedly emphasized that the Government had to prove the requisite intent beyond a reasonable doubt. For example, the district court instructed the jury orally that the Government was required to prove that \"there was a scheme or artifice to defraud or to obtain money or property by materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises,\" J.A. 4460, and that the defendant must have \"knowingly, willfully, and voluntarily joined in the scheme, [and] must have participated in the scheme with an intent to defraud someone else.\" J.A. 4756. Based on the entirety of the jury instructions and the context of the omitted sentence, the charge was not misleading and contained an adequate statement of the law regarding the charged offense.\n\n36\nAppellants also object to the portion of Instruction 40 that stated: \"A defendant's belief that the victim of the fraud will be paid in the future or will sustain no economic loss is no defense to the crimes charged in the indictment.\" J.A. 5318; Appellants' Br. 16-17. This instruction accurately states the proposition that a belief that the victim will be repaid eventually is not a defense to fraud. See United States v. Molinaro, 11 F.3d 853, 863 (9th Cir. 1993) (approving of identical instruction), contained in Model Crim. Jury Instr. 9th Cir. \u00a7 3.17 (2003). In sum, we reject Appellants' arguments regarding the sufficiency of evidence for their conviction and whether the district court properly charged the jury.\n\nIII.\n\n37\nAllen alleges that the admission of corporate records from Tech Com, produced by Reinhardt in response to a Government subpoena, incriminated Allen, and because Reinhardt was not subject to cross-examination, violated Allen's rights under Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S. Ct. 1620,  20 L. Ed. 2d 476 (1968). Allen also argues that because of the Tech Com documents, as well as Reinhardt's litigation strategy, the denial of his severance motion constitutes reversible error.\n\nA.\n\n38\nIn Bruton, the Supreme Court held that where a non-testifying codefendant's statement implicates the defendant, a limiting instruction is inadequate to prevent a violation of the defendant's Confrontation Clause rights. Id. at 135-37, 88 S. Ct. 1620; see United States v. Locklear, 24 F.3d 641, 645 (4th Cir.1994).\n\n39\nThe threshold issue in this case is whether the Tech Com fax cover sheets containing Allen's name were statements by Reinhardt, a non-testifying codefendant. In Braswell v. United States, 487 U.S. 99, 108 S. Ct. 2284, 101 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1988), the Supreme Court recognized that the act of producing documents pursuant to subpoena could have evidentiary significance. As a consequence, \"in a criminal prosecution against the [corporate] custodian, the Government may not introduce into evidence before the jury the fact that the subpoena was served upon and the corporation's documents were delivered by one particular individual, the custodian.\" Id. at 118, 108 S. Ct. 2284. On the other hand, the government may use the corporation's act of production against the custodian if evidence is adduced from another source that the corporation produced the records. Id. In that case, \"[b]ecause the jury [was] not told that the defendant produced the records, any nexus between the defendant and the documents results solely from the corporation's act of production and other evidence in the case.\" Id.\n\n40\nIn this case, none of the Tech Com documents introduced into evidence before the jury were referred to as documents produced by Reinhardt. The documents were introduced as Tech Com documents, and witnesses testified as to the phone numbers or handwriting that appeared on the documents. Because the jury was never told that Reinhardt produced the Tech Com evidence, there is no act-of-production inference that could have been drawn. Cf. Braswell, 487 U.S. at 118, 108 S. Ct. 2284. Any link between the Tech Com documents and Reinhardt or Allen resulted solely from other evidence linking the defendants to Tech Com, rather than Reinhardt's act of producing the documents in response to a Government subpoena. Cf. Id. Because the jury was not told that Reinhardt produced the Tech Com records, those records were not statements by him. Where there is no introduction of statements by a nontestifying codefendant, Bruton is not violated.\n\nB.\n\n41\nWe review the district court's rulings on severance and mistrial claims for abuse of discretion. United States v. Najjar, 300 F.3d 466, 473 (4th Cir.2002). We review factual findings made in connection with those claims for clear error. Id. In Zafiro v. United States, the Supreme Court commented that \"[t]here is a preference in the federal system for joint trials of defendants who are indicted together.\" 506 U.S. 534, 537, 113 S. Ct. 933,  122 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1993). Zafiro noted that joint trials play a vital role in the federal criminal system and promote efficiency while avoiding the possibility of inconsistent verdicts. Id. at 573, 113 S. Ct. 933. Accordingly, Zafiro concluded that \"a district court should grant a severance under Rule 14 [of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure] only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.\" Id. at 539, 113 S. Ct. 933.\n\n42\nThis risk might be present where evidence admissible against one codefendant, but not the other, is introduced. Id. In a complex case, where codefendants have \"markedly different degrees of culpability, this risk of prejudice is heightened.\" Id. Similarly, a defendant may be prejudiced if he could not avail himself of exculpatory evidence in a joint trial that would be available were he tried alone. Id.\n\n43\n\"[I]t is well settled that defendants are not entitled to severance merely because they may have a better chance of acquittal in separate trials.\" Id. at 540,  113 S. Ct. 933. Without a strong showing of prejudice, severance is not justified based on the mere disparity of the evidence adduced against individual defendants. United States v. Mandel, 591 F.2d 1347, 1371 (4th Cir.), vacated en banc on other grounds, 602 F.2d 653 (4th Cir.1979). A defendant is not entitled to severance merely because his defense conflicts with or is antagonistic to a codefendant's defense. Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 538,  113 S. Ct. 933; Najjar, 300 F.3d at 474. This is true, even where one defendant desires to exculpate himself by inculpating a codefendant. See Najjar, 300 F.3d at 474 (citing United States v. Spitler, 800 F.2d 1267, 1271 (4th Cir.1986)). A showing to justify severance\n\n44\nrequires more than finger pointing. There must be such a sharp contrast presented by the defenses that the jury is presented with the proposition that to believe the core of one defense it must disbelieve the core of the other, or that the jury will unjustifiably infer that this conflict alone demonstrates that both are guilty.\n\n45\nId. (quotation marks and citations omitted). This contrast is satisfied where a defendant's guilt is \"dictated by the asserted innocence of the codefendants.\" Id.\n\n46\nReinhardt's affirmative defense\u2014 that the Tech Com transactions were legitimate and that Washington was the individual involved in wrongdoing\u2014was likely more harmful than helpful to both him and Allen. Focusing on the efficacy of the defense, however, overlooks the salient fact that both Reinhardt and Allen employed essentially the same defense: that neither were actually engaged in the charged fraudulent scheme and that Washington and others were the true wrongdoers. Although Reinhardt elected to present witnesses to corroborate his theory of being the innocent dupe to a consummate schemer, Washington, and Allen preferred to rest his innocence on the Government's failure to prove his involvement and the canard that he was a mere clerical employee, there was nothing antagonistic, or even incompatible, about the Appellants' defenses.\n\n47\nAn examination of the evidence presented against Allen during the Government's case, as well as the testimony of Reinhardt's defense witnesses, demonstrates that Reinhardt's defense was not so antagonistic to Allen's that to believe one was to disbelieve the core of the other. Reinhardt's asserted innocence in no way dictated a finding of Allen's guilt. Nor did Reinhardt's defense cause the jury to infer unjustifiably that both Allen and Reinhardt were guilty. Examining the testimony of the witnesses presented during Reinhardt's defense corroborates this conclusion. In addition, there was sufficient evidence presented during the Government's case-in-chief to allow the jury to convict Allen.\n\n48\nAllen claims prejudice from a document that was faxed from Allen Freight Systems, a company that he owned, and entered into evidence during the testimony of one of Reinhardt's witnesses. As a result of this document, Allen claims that he was forced to show the jury samples of his own handwriting to establish that he did not fax the document. This, in turn, led the jury to be able to link Allen's handwriting to that on fax cover sheets, in alleged violation of Allen's constitutional rights. This argument ignores that the document was faxed from a company Allen admitted to owning and that the document would have been admissible against him even if he had been tried separately from Reinhardt. Additionally, the Government entered into evidence examples of Allen's handwriting during its case-in-chief in connection with a rental application he submitted. Thus, there was no prejudice to Allen from the entry into evidence of the faxed document from Allen Freight Systems during Reinhardt's affirmative defense.\n\n49\nReinhardt's defense was not so inherently antagonistic to Allen's defense as to justify severance under the standard set forth in Najjar. In addition, Allen has not demonstrated any specific instances of impermissible prejudice from his joint trial with Reinhardt. Thus, we reject his claim that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motions for severance and a mistrial.\n\nIV.\n\n50\nReinhardt alleges that the district court did not properly inquire as to the validity of a potential defense witness's refusal to testify on the basis of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and thus violated Reinhardt's Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process. In addition, Reinhardt alleges that the Government engaged in misconduct with regard to the potential witness, Robert Hickman, and requests a remand to develop evidence in that regard. Finally, Reinhardt argues that his counsel's acceptance of Hickman's invocation of the privilege represented constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. We reject these arguments in their entirety.\n\nA.\n\n51\nThe Fifth Amendment privilege \"not only extends to answers that would in themselves support a conviction under a federal criminal statute but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a federal crime.\" Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S. Ct. 814, 95 L. Ed. 1118 (1951). The propriety of the invocation of the privilege is not determined by the witness herself, but by the court. Id. Because requiring a witness to prove the necessity of the privilege would often vitiate the privilege itself, \"it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\" Id. at 486-87, 71 S. Ct. 814. Because a criminal defendant has a right under the Sixth Amendment to compel testimony, if a defense witness refuses to testify on the basis of the Fifth Amendment, \"the trial judge must make a proper and particularized inquiry into the legitimacy and scope of the witness's assertion of the privilege.\" Gaskins v. McKellar, 916 F.2d 941, 950 (4th Cir.1990). \"A witness may be totally excused only if the court finds that he could legitimately refuse to answer any and all relevant questions.\" Id.\n\n52\nIn this case, because Reinhardt's counsel accepted Hickman's counsel's assertion that Hickman would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege, the district court did not err by declining to inquire further, given that it had appointed Hickman counsel on the basis of its threshold belief that there was a valid Fifth Amendment issue. Cf. United States v. Lee, 60 Fed.Appx. 425, 427 (4th Cir.2003); United States v. Ortiz, 82 F.3d 1066, 1073 (D.C.Cir.1996) (\"We find no plain error as a result of the district court's failure to inquire sua sponte whether the witness was entitled to assert a blanket privilege.\").\n\nB.\n\n53\nReinhardt argues that evidence of a communication between Hickman, his counsel, and the Government prior to Hickman's refusal to testify warrants a remand to determine whether the Government's actions violated Webb v. Texas, 409 U.S. 95, 93 S. Ct. 351, 34 L. Ed. 2d 330 (1972), or United States v. Golding, 168 F.3d 700 (4th Cir.1999). To prevail on a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must show (1) that the prosecutor's remarks and conduct were, in fact, improper and (2) that such remarks or conduct prejudiced the defendant to such an extent as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. Golding, 168 F.3d at 702. In this case, there is no evidence whatsoever that the Government acted improperly in any manner. A remand is thus unnecessary to develop any evidence on this claim.\n\nC.\n\n54\nReinhardt submits that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective by acquiescing in Hickman's refusal to testify on the basis of his Fifth Amendment privilege. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are normally raised before the district court via 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and are cognizable on direct appeal only where it conclusively appears on the record that defense counsel did not provide effective representation. See United States v. King, 119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). The record in this case does not conclusively suggest any prejudice to Reinhardt from Hickman's failure to testify. Thus, Reinhardt's ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not cognizable on direct appeal.\n\nV.\n\n55\nAllen and Reinhardt argue that the district court's disclosure to the Government of a document containing legal arguments regarding the defense's intended cross-examination of a witness impermissibly intruded upon protected attorney work product and violated their Sixth Amendment rights to effective assistance of counsel. Because the Appellants do not allege any prejudice from the district court's disclosure, and none is apparent from the record, there was no Sixth Amendment violation.\n\n56\nRecognizing that Washington was a key witness and that the defense intended to make extensive use of his prior convictions during cross-examination, the district court ordered the defense to prepare a document detailing the specific prior convictions it intended to introduce, as well as legal arguments supporting such questioning. After defense counsel provided the requested document, the court indicated that it would review the document over the weekend and then disclose the document the following Monday to the Government, provided that the Government not reveal the document to the Assistant United States Attorney responsible for preparing Washington for his testimony. Defense counsel did not object at this time.\n\n57\nAfter reviewing the document, the district court ordered the defense to provide a copy to the Government, with the stipulation that it not be shared with the Assistant United States Attorney preparing Washington. At that time, the defense attorney who prepared the document and who intended to cross-examine Washington, who was not present during the previous discussion about the document, objected, claiming that the document was essentially a road map of his cross-examination. Seeking to \"avoid having interminable bench conferences,\" the district court overruled the objection. J.A. 2913.\n\n58\nOn appeal, Appellants do not allege any prejudice from the district court's decision to allow a Government attorney to view the document prior to the defense's cross-examination. Nor do Appellants argue that the district court's screening order, which essentially kept the document ex parte, at least from the Assistant United States Attorney preparing Washington, was insufficient to prevent prejudice to the Appellants. \"[I]t is well settled that some showing of prejudice is a necessary element of a Sixth Amendment claim based on an invasion of the attorney-client relationship.\" United States v. Chavez, 902 F.2d 259, 266 (4th Cir.1990). Because Appellants do not allege any prejudice from the district court's actions, nor is any prejudice clear from the record, there was no Sixth Amendment violation. The district court took steps to ensure that the document remained screened off from the Assistant United States Attorney responsible for preparing Washington and the defense's cross-examination was not impaired in any respect. Although district courts possess wide discretion with regard to case management, providing the government with documents pertaining to a defense's intended cross-examination risks disclosure of protected work-product and we discourage such orders. In this case, however, we need not reach the issue of whether work product was inherent in the disclosed document because the district court effectively screened the document from the Government's counsel responsible for the witness and the Appellants do not allege that any prejudice resulted from this arrangement. Accordingly, we reject Appellants' argument that their Sixth Amendment rights were violated.\n\nVI.\n\n59\nFinally, Reinhardt asserts that the district court committed numerous errors in calculating his sentence. When we review a post-Booker sentence of a district court, the overall inquiry is whether the sentence is \"within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\" United States v. Hughes, 401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). A sentence within the proper Sentencing Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. See United States v. Johnson, 445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006). \"In considering whether a sentence is unreasonable, we . . . review the district court's legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\" United States v. Hampton, 441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006). In reviewing loss calculation, we review de novo the district court's interpretation of what constitutes \"loss,\" while accepting the calculation of loss absent clear error. Hughes, 401 F.3d at 557 (reviewing determination of loss under Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1)).\n\nA.\n\n60\nReinhardt argues that the district court abused its discretion by not granting a downward departure because of his family circumstances. Reinhardt's son suffers from two rare genetic disorders, neurofibro-matosis and congenital pseudoarthrosis of the left leg. Reinhardt claims that the district court's anger at his sentencing counsel, resulting from their voluminous submissions in connection with sentencing and continued submissions as to Reinhardt's innocence, caused the court to deny the downward departure.\n\n61\n\"A district court's decision not to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines is not reviewable unless the court mistakenly believed that it lacked authority to depart.\" United States v. Carr, 271 F.3d 172, 176 (4th Cir.2001). In this case, the district court acknowledged that it had the ability to grant Reinhardt a downward departure based on his family circumstances, but did not believe that such a departure was warranted. Because the district court understood its ability to depart from the Guidelines, it was \"under no misperception as to its authority, [and] its refusal to depart is not subject to appellate review.\" Id. at 176-77. Accordingly, we cannot disturb the district court's decision not to grant Reinhardt a downward departure based on family circumstances and must dismiss this portion of his appeal.\n\nB.\n\n62\nReinhardt claims that the district court erred in applying a one-level enhancement for identity theft under \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(5)(C)(i). Reinhardt argues that while the evidence is clear that Washington engaged in identity theft, there was no evidence that Reinhardt engaged in such theft, even if he was aware of Washington's actions.\n\n63\nSection 2F1.1(b)(5)(C)(i) of the Guidelines provides for a two-level enhancement if a fraud offense involved \"the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification.\" This subsection applies where a defendant, without authorization, uses an individual's name and social security number or address to obtain a bank loan or credit card. See Guidelines \u00a7 2F1.1 cmt. 16.; United States v. Baldwin, 14 Fed.Appx. 192, 196 n. 8 (4th Cir.2001). The subsection has also been held to apply where a defendant, without authorization, uses an individual's information to obtain a lease or open a bank account. See United States v. Samet, 200 Fed.Appx. 15, 23 (2d Cir.2006) (\"Like the account number of a bank loan, the account number of the leases thus constitute `means of identification,' and because they were obtained unlawfully, [the defendants'] base offense levels were appropriately enhanced.\"); United States v. Norwood, No. 05-15154, 2006 WL 952330, at *1, ___ Fed.Appx. ___ (11th Cir. April 13, 2006) (\"The names of his mother and uncle were the means of identification. [The defendant] used those means to produce another means of identification: the bank account numbers. Accordingly, the identity theft enhancement applies.\").\n\n64\nIn this case, the district court applied a one-level enhancement to Reinhardt's sentence under \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(5)(C)(I) based on, among other facts, Reinhardt's knowingly processing a lease with Khrlobian containing Khrlobian's wife's social security number and name, which Reinhardt knew were being used without her consent, and Reinhardt's knowledge that Washington's girlfriend had listed her father as guarantor on the Variety Cutz leases without his knowledge. In addition, the district court found that the overall fraudulent scheme depended on \"dressing up\" the lease applications with creditworthy guarantors, regardless of whether permission had been obtained from those individuals.\n\n65\nThe evidence adduced at trial reflected the fact that Washington primarily filled out lease applications where guarantors were listed without their knowledge. The evidence involving Khrlobian's wife and Washington's girlfriend demonstrates, however, that Reinhardt was aware in at least two instances of individual's names, driver's licenses, and \"credit,\" including social security numbers, being used without authorization to obtain leases from financing companies. Given this, the district court did not err in applying a one-level identity theft enhancement under \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(5)(C)(I) of the Guidelines.\n\n66\nIn addition, Reinhardt objects to the inclusion in his loss calculation of two leases arranged by Telcom, another company that he and Washington used as a purported equipment vendor, claiming that there was insufficient evidence that he was involved with Telcom. Given the evidence, the district court did not clearly err in including the Telcom leases in Reinhardt's loss calculation. Even assuming, arguendo, that the Telcom leases were wrongly included, those leases only increased the loss calculation by $132,400. The loss calculation due to Reinhardt's conduct was $1,694,164. Reducing this amount by the Telcom lease amount yields $1,561,764, which corresponds to the same offense level as Reinhardt's calculated loss level. See Guidelines \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1)(M). Thus, any error with respect to inclusion of the Telcom leases was harmless.\n\nC.\n\n67\nReinhardt's remaining objections to his sentencing attack the district court's methodology and his counsel's effectiveness. We summarily reject these arguments.\n\n68\nFirst, Reinhardt alleges that the district court's \"stacking\" of two counts to raise Reinhardt's possible maximum sentence from sixty to seventy months was improper, but provides no argument as to why. Under \u00a7 5G1.2 of the Guidelines, if a defendant is convicted of multiple counts of an offense and the calculated sentence under the Guidelines exceeds the statutory maximum on one of the counts, the sentence should be imposed consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the calculated sentence. See United States v. Chase, 296 F.3d 247, 250-51 (4th Cir.2002) (explaining \"stacking\" procedure under \u00a7 5G1.2).\n\n69\nApplying the Guidelines, the district court determined Reinhardt's offense level as a 27, with a criminal history in category I, yielding a range of 70 to 87 months. The statutory maximum for each count under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 is sixty months. See 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343 (2000). Because the Guidelines range exceeded the statutory maximum for one count, and Reinhardt was convicted of multiple counts under \u00a7 1343, the Guidelines allowed the district court to \"stack\" multiple counts consecutively to achieve a sentence within the Guidelines range. There is no evidence in the record that the district court acted improperly in following the mandate of the Guidelines and increasing Reinhardt's maximum sentence to seventy months. See United States v. Battle, 174 Fed.Appx. 179, 181-82 (4th Cir.2006) (approving of post-Booker \"stacking\" under \u00a7 5G1.2(d)); United States v. Smalls, 185 Fed.Appx. 218, 220-21 (4th Cir.2006) (same).\n\n70\nNext, relying on United States v. Lauersen, 348 F.3d 329 (2d Cir.2003), aff'd on reh'g, 362 F.3d 160 (2d Cir.2004), vacated by, 543 U.S. 1097,  125 S. Ct. 1109, 160 L. Ed. 2d 988 (2005), Reinhardt argues that the cumulation of upward enhancements for more than minimal planning, sophisticated means, and masterminding the scheme in question enhanced his sentence to an impermissible degree. Putting aside the issue of whether Lauersen is viable in the Second Circuit following its vacatur by the Supreme Court, it was never the law of this Circuit. Thus, the district court did not err in rejecting Reinhardt's Lauersen argument. In addition, the district court did not err in applying separate upward enhancements to Reinhardt's sentence where those enhancements were based on the Guidelines and supported by the evidence.\n\n71\nReinhardt argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was based on facts not found by the jury and that the district court treated the Guidelines (and enhancements found thereunder) as mandatory, thus violating Booker and Hughes. The district court did not err in any respect in calculating Reinhardt's sentence; the procedure followed was in full accord with our precedents and did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory in violation of Booker. Accordingly, we reject Reinhardt's argument that his sentence was imposed in violation of Booker and Hughes.\n\n72\nFinally, Reinhardt claims that his sentencing counsel provided ineffective representation by submitting too many claims to the district court, arguing every conceivable legal point, and submitting evidence that the district court termed \"flimflam.\" Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are normally raised before the district court via 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and are cognizable on direct appeal only where it conclusively appears on the record that defense counsel did not provide effective representation. See King, 119 F.3d at 295.\n\n73\nThe record in this case does not conclusively suggest that Reinhardt's counsel was deficient during the sentencing phase. Furthermore, it is not conclusively shown on the record that any deficiency in counsel prejudiced Reinhardt. Accordingly, Reinhardt's ineffective assistance of counsel claim with regard to the sentencing phase of his trial is not cognizable on direct appeal.\n\n74\nIn sum, none of Reinhardt's challenges to his sentence are meritorious, and the district court did not err in imposing a sentence of seventy months.\n\nVII.\n\n75\nFor the foregoing reasons, we dismiss Reinhardt's appeal of the district court's failure to grant a downward departure and affirm the convictions and sentences of Reinhardt and Allen in their entirety.\n\n76\nDISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.", "annotations": [{"start":

A jury found Carani guilty of possession, but returned a verdict of not guilty as to one of the receipt counts, and was unable to reach a unanimous decision as to the other receipt count. The district court sentenced Carani to seventy-two months' imprisonment. Carani appeals both his conviction and sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\nCarani is an Italian immigrant who moved to the United States in 1972. He, along with his wife Natza, owned a computer. On this computer, Carani used a program called Kazaa Lite (\"Kazaa\").\n\nKazaa is a peer-to-peer file sharing program through which users may download files (music, videos, text, etc.) from the computers of other Kazaa users. Users search for files using search terms as they would in a web browser. Kazaa returns a list of available files that fit the users' search criteria. Users may gain more information about the files by hovering over the file name with the computer cursor. These files are located on the computers of other Kazaa users, not on the Internet at large. The purpose of Kazaa is to allow its users to share such files with each other. When files are completely downloaded or shared through Kazaa, a record of that activity is logged on the user's computer in a database located in what we will call the \".db folder.\"\n\nFiles that are downloaded using Kazaa are placed, by default, in the user's \"My Shared Folder.\" If a user does not wish to allow other users to access his files, he may change his Kazaa settings so that he may download files from others' computers, but they may not download files from his computer. In order to encourage users to share their files, Kazaa employs a participation level system. Participation levels range from 0 to 1,000, and increase with the number of files the user shares. When multiple users attempt to download the same file, they are placed in a queue. Users with higher participation levels are given priority over those with lower participation levels. Thus, a user who shares his files with others will be able to more quickly and easily download the files that he wants from other Kazaa users.\n\nIn February 2005, agents in the Cyber Crimes Unit of the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), obtained a warrant to search Carani's residence. During the search, Senior Special Agent Jason Varda found Carani's computer. It was powered on, connected to the Internet, and running Kazaa at the time. Through Kazaa, Carani's *870 computer was actively downloading files from other Kazaa users, and allowing other Kazaa users to download files on Carani's computer. Agent Varda photographed the screen, which showed that another user was attempting to download a file by the name \"incest porn, a little girl has sex with an adult guy.\" The lower right of the computer screen indicated: \"Connected as default user at Kazaa, sharing 214 files.\"\n\nAfter photographing the computer screen, Agent Varda disconnected the computer from its power supply. He removed the hard drive and connected it to a write-blocking device to ensure that no data entered the hard drive. Agent Varda then used a software program called En-Case to preview all of the files on the hard drive, including those that had been deleted. The preview revealed a number of suspected child pornography videos.\n\nAgents interviewed Natza during the search. Natza indicated that she and Carani had watched videos of child pornography\u2014sometimes in their entirety\u2014on their computer and then deleted them. Meanwhile, Carani agreed to accompany agents to the Highland Park police department. At the station, he was advised of his constitutional rights orally and in writing, and he agreed to be interviewed. Initially, Carani told the agents that he had come across child pornography while searching for adult pornography and had seen it about ten times. He said that when this happened, he would watch the video and then delete it, and that he had never saved any child pornography on his computer. Later, Carani said that he had seen \"tons\" of child pornography, and that he may have had one video saved.\n\nThe agents took a break from the interview to consult with the United States Attorney's Office. When they returned, Carani admitted that he had not been entirely forthcoming with them. Carani said that he used terms such as \"pedo\" and \"r@ygold\" to search Kazaa specifically for child pornography. Agents testified at trial that both of these terms are related to child pornography. Carani also told the agents that the saved video that he had mentioned before the break was titled \"Segundo.\" Carani further indicated that he was particularly interested in videos involving family incest. He stated that he was no longer aroused by adult pornography, and had last viewed child pornography between two weeks and one month prior to the interview. He told the agents that he had never intentionally distributed child pornography, but that he may have done so inadvertently through the Kazaa program as he did not understand what the \"My Shared Folder\" did.\n\nCarani then prepared the following written statement:\n\nI have viewed child pornography in the past and then deleted it. I have only one saved right now in the saved section, which is \"My Kazaa Lite.\" As far as computers are concerned I am a beginner at best. I did not distribute any of these videos on purpose, and I have no explanation as to how these videos were shared, but I never shared anything. I don[']t even know how to do so. The only explanation is that, as I viewed them and deleted them, they were automatically shared without my knowing of it. Some of these videos I stumbled upon by accident downloading other videos, and through [curiosity] I looked up some child pornography and again deleted it when I saw it. but the more I saw the more I felt that it was wrong to do so. My intentions were never to hurt anybody and forgive my ignorance but I did not know that this was against the law via the way it was done (through Kazaa Lite). I feel extremely bad about what happened, but I can say that I learned a lot through this experience.\n*871 Carani's hard drive was sent to Agent Skinner, an ICE forensic analyst with the Cyber Crimes Center in Fairfax, Virginia. Agent Skinner made further use of the EnCase software to analyze the contents of Carani's hard drive. Agent Skinner testified that he initially found two child pornography files in Carani's temporary Internet folders, both \"BabyJ Sunshine\" files, which he determined had been accessed through a web browser. Agent Skinner used EnCase to search for \"BabyJ\" references. His search turned up a number of such references, including references to the Kazaa My Shared Folder, and the term \"pedophilia.\" Agent Skinner then constructed a search using a variety of terms associated with child pornography: pedophilia, young Lolita, kiddie, preteen, kindersex, pedo, BabyJ, Baby J, pedo video, illegal pedophilia, r@ygold, underage, incest, Lolita, kiddie porn, real kiddie, kinder, and child lover. This search of the hard drive returned a large number of separate and distinct hits, including 3,050 hits for \"kiddie,\" 2,011 hits for \"preteen,\" 3,603 hits for \"pedo,\" 1,799 hits for \"r@ygold,\" and 3,720 hits for \"Lolita.\" Agent Skinner concluded that Carani was actively seeking out child pornography, as a home computer would not otherwise contain so many references to terms associated with child pornography. Agent Skinner also located numerous files in both the My Shared Folder and the .db folder whose names were suggestive of child pornography. Agent Skinner testified that when a user downloads a file from Kazaa, he is able to view the file name, and when he hovers over the file name, he can see a file description and keywords. Additionally, the Kazaa screen contains a display which notifies the user that another person is downloading a file from his computer, and indicates which file.\n\nAgent Skinner also testified regarding Carani's Kazaa participation level. Carani's participation level was 771, out of a possible 1,000. Agent Skinner determined that Carani's high participation level was the result of a \"hack\"\u2014an unauthorized technique which caused Carani's computer to download files from itself, and artificially boost his participation level. Use of the hack required action on the part of the computer user, and there was evidence that the hack had been used extensively. Agent Skinner further testified that Carani's computer and Kazaa program functioned properly.\n\nCarani called Scott Ellis, a computer business consultant, to testify as an expert on his behalf. Ellis testified that Carani was not a sophisticated computer user, and did not know how to use his My Shared Folder on Kazaa. He also testified that a virus, worm, remotely located pedophile, or software glitches could have caused the references to child pornography found on the computer. Ellis described Kazaa as \"a piece of rogue software\" that \"can behave in an uncontrolled fashion.\" R. 131, p. 464.\n\nNatza and Carani both testified at trial. Each denied making statements to agents that they had watched child pornography, and explained that they only saw child pornography when they mistakenly came across it while searching for adult pornography. They explained that they downloaded video files in large blocks, then reviewed it and discarded the child pornography that they came across. They also emphasized that they were computer novices, and did not fully understand the Kazaa program.\n\nIn rebuttal, Agent Skinner testified that his analysis showed that child pornography videos were not downloaded in large chunks along with adult pornography; rather, they were downloaded along with other child pornography, in groups of five or six. Agent Skinner also refuted Ellis's testimony that the Kazaa program was not running properly on Carani's computer.\n\n*872 When it came time to instruct the jury, the court used the Seventh Circuit's pattern instructions to define knowingly: \"When the word `knowingly' is used in these instructions, it means that the defendant realized what he was doing and was aware of the nature of his conduct, and did not act through ignorance, mistake, or accident.\" 7th Cir. Pattern Jury Inst. 4.06. The court also included an instruction on deliberate avoidance, also known as an \"ostrich instruction\": \"You may infer knowledge from a combination of suspicion and indifference to the truth.\" Id. This instruction included an example relevant to this case: \"If you find that the defendant had a strong suspicion that a file was child pornography, but ignored that suspicion and downloaded the file, you may conclude that he acted knowingly, as I have used that word.\" The district court also instructed the jury on the meaning of possession: \"In the context of this case, possession means intentionally retaining child pornography after downloading it.\"\n\nAfter the jury began deliberations, they sent the following question to the district court: \"Does downloading, watching, & deleting constitute possession?\" The district court replied: \"The answer to this question depends upon whether, at the time he downloaded material, the defendant knew or strongly suspected that it was child pornography and downloaded it anyway. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that he did, then the answer to your question is `yes.' If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant knew or strongly suspected that the material was child pornography at the time he downloaded it, then the answer to your question is `no.'\"\n\nThe jury found Carani guilty of possession, but returned a verdict of not guilty as to one of the receipt counts, and was unable to reach a unanimous decision as to the other receipt count.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing, the district court heard arguments from both sides. Carani's counsel reiterated his arguments that Carani was not a sophisticated computer user, and that he only downloaded child pornography inadvertently. In support of a distribution enhancement, the government argued that Carani received a \"thing of value\" as required by the Sentencing Guidelines, by increasing his participation level, which improved his accessibility to other users' files, and that Carani's actions constituted \"active trading\" in contraband materials. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B).\n\nThe district court found that \"[t]he defendant's position in regard to whether he knew he possessed child pornography is simply counter to the credible evidence produced at trial, and therefore I do find that the defendant knowingly obtained child pornography on his computer. . . . And turning now to the first guideline issue to which that finding pertains, I do find that the defendant knowingly distributed child pornography in that he knowingly made his child pornography on his computer available to other Kazaa users, who downloaded it from his computer.\" Mar. 16, 2006 Tr. 38-39. The district court imposed a two-level sentencing enhancement for distribution under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F). The district court added: \"A subsidiary finding implied in what I have just said is that the defendant was perfectly aware of the shared files folder. He knew what was in it, he accessed it, and his denial that he knew what was in there is simply not credible.\" Mar. 16, 2006 Tr. 39. The district court sentenced Carani to 72 months' imprisonment and two years of supervised release.\n\nII. ANALYSIS\n\nThis appeal presents three issues: (1) whether the district court abused its discretion *873 by giving the deliberate avoidance \"ostrich\" instruction to the jury; (2) whether the district court's response to a jury question was in error; and (3) whether the district court improperly applied a sentencing enhancement for the distribution of child pornography.\n\nA. Ostrich Instruction\n\nWe review the district court's decision to give an ostrich instruction for an abuse of discretion, viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the government. United States v. Leahy, 464 F.3d 773, 796 (7th Cir.2006); United States v. Carrillo, 435 F.3d 767, 780 (7th Cir.2006) (citing United States v. Fallon, 348 F.3d 248, 253 (7th Cir.2003)).\n\nAn ostrich instruction is appropriate where (1) the defendant claims a lack of guilty knowledge, and (2) the government has presented evidence sufficient for a jury to conclude that the defendant deliberately avoided learning the truth. Carrillo, 435 F.3d at 780. Deliberate avoidance is more than mere negligence, the defendant must have \"deliberately avoided acquiring knowledge of the crime being committed by cutting off his curiosity through an effort of the will.\" Leahy, 464 F.3d at 796 (citing Fallon, 348 F.3d at 253). Deliberate avoidance is not a standard less than knowledge; it is simply another way that knowledge may be proven. Carrillo, 435 F.3d at 780 (citing United States v. Ramsey, 785 F.2d 184, 189 (7th Cir.1986)). \"The purpose of the ostrich instruction `is to inform the jury that a person may not escape criminal liability by pleading ignorance if he knows or strongly suspects he is involved in criminal dealings but deliberately avoids learning more exact information about the nature or extent of those dealings.'\" Carrillo, 435 F.3d at 780 (quoting United States v. Craig, 178 F.3d 891, 896 (7th Cir.1999); United States v. Rodriguez, 929 F.2d 1224, 1227 (7th Cir.1991)).\n\nPhysical acts and outward expressions by the defendant evidencing his deliberate avoidance, while useful, are not necessary for a jury to infer that the defendant was curious but deliberately ignored his suspicions. Carrillo 435 F.3d at 780-81 (explaining the difference between avoidance through \"overt physical acts\" and \"purely psychological\" avoidance). The circumstances surrounding the defendant may be sufficient to infer that, given what the defendant knew, he must have forced his suspicions aside and deliberately avoided confirming for himself that he was engaged in criminal activity. Id. at 781 (citing United States v. Carrillo, 269 F.3d 761, 769-70 (7th Cir.2001); United States v. Farouil, 124 F.3d 838, 844 (7th Cir. 1997); United States v. Stone, 987 F.2d 469, 472 (7th Cir.1993); Rodriguez, 929 F.2d at 1227-28; United States v. Caliendo, 910 F.2d 429, 434 (7th Cir.1990); United States v. Josefik, 753 F.2d 585, 589 (7th Cir.1985); United States v. Burns, 683 F.2d 1056, 1060 (7th Cir.1982)).\n\nThe crux of Carani's argument at trial was that any child pornography videos he may have downloaded to his computer were downloaded solely through inadvertence. In addition to direct evidence that Carani in fact intended to download child pornography, such as statements he made to agents at the Highland Park Police Station, the government also presented evidence from which a jury could infer that Carani deliberately avoided confirming that certain files were in fact child pornography. Government witnesses testified that many files that were, or had once been, on Carani's computer had words associated with child pornography in the file names. Those file names, in addition to file descriptions and keyword listings, would have been displayed in the *874 Kazaa search listings when Carani downloaded them. These words indicating that the files contained child pornography were, quite literally, right in front of his face. Thousands upon thousands of references to child pornography were found on Carani's computer; and evidence, such as the hack used to boost his participation level, suggests that Carani was not so bungling a computer user as he suggested.\n\nThe government presented evidence sufficient for the jury to infer that Carani suspected that files he was downloading and sharing with others contained child pornography, but deliberately pushed those suspicions aside in order to avoid confirming his criminal activities. The district court did not abuse its discretion by giving the ostrich instruction to the jury.\n\nB. Response to Jury Question\n\n\"We review a decision to answer a question from the jury as well as the language used in the response for an abuse of discretion.\" United States v. Hewlett, 453 F.3d 876, 880 (7th Cir.2006) (citing United States v. Young, 316 F.3d 649 (7th Cir.2002)). \"[T]he district court retains broad discretion in deciding how to respond to a question propounded from the jury and . . . the court has an obligation to dispel any confusion quickly and with concrete accuracy.\" United States v. Sims, 329 F.3d 937, 943 (7th Cir.2003). When reviewing the language of a supplemental jury instruction, we consider three factors: \"(1) whether the instructions as a whole fairly and adequately treat the issues; (2) whether the supplemental instruction is a correct statement of the law; and (3) whether the district court answered the jury's questions specifically.\" United States v. Danford, 435 F.3d 682, 688 (7th Cir.2006) (citing Sims, 329 F.3d at 943; Young, 316 F.3d at 662). An error in a supplemental instruction is only reversible if the defendant has been prejudiced. See Young, 316 F.3d at 662.\n\nCarani argues that, in answering the jury's question about possession, the district court impermissibly lowered the burden of proof with respect to knowledge by including the language, \"knew or strongly suspected.\" Given the jury's confusion on such a critical aspect of the instructions, the district court was within its discretion to provide the jury with an answer. See Sims, 329 F.3d at 943.\n\nHaving concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion by providing a supplemental instruction, we must next evaluate the language used in that instruction under the three factor rubric. See Danford, 435 F.3d at 688. The first and third factors are easily satisfied. The district court provided a thorough explanation that was specifically targeted at the jury's question regarding whether the defendant \"possessed\" child pornography if he discarded it after he watched it. The second factor, whether the instruction accurately stated the law, deserves more discussion.\n\nThe district court's supplemental instruction indicated that Carani could only be guilty of possession if, \"at the time he downloaded material, the defendant knew or strongly suspected that it was child pornography and downloaded it anyway.\" This definition of possession is surely too narrow.\n\nSuppose that, unbeknownst to an individual, a stranger on the street mistakenly slips a bag of marijuana into his pocket. Moments later, he is arrested on an outstanding warrant and the officer discovers the marijuana. He is not guilty of the possession of marijuana, because he does not have the requisite knowledge. But, suppose that before he is arrested on the outstanding warrant, he discovers the marijuana and decides to keep it. Then, despite the fact that he did not know about the marijuana at the time that it was put *875 in his pocket, he would have all of the knowledge required to be guilty of possession. United States v. Myers, 355 F.3d 1040, 1042 (7th Cir.2004); see United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 76-78, 115 S. Ct. 464,  130 L. Ed. 2d 372 (1994); United States v. Hall, 142 F.3d 988, 997 (7th Cir.1998) (explaining that if a defendant had the opportunity to delete child pornography files on his computer but chose not to, the requirements of possession have been met).\n\nIt is this second scenario that the district court's instructions did not take into account. A possessor of child pornography videos need not know that it is such at the time of download, so long as he discovers that it is child pornography after the download and decides to keep it anyway. The district court's instruction on possession crafted too narrow a definition of possession by requiring knowledge at the time of download.\n\nThus, the instruction could not have harmed Carani. If anything, Carani benefited from giving it. In effect, the jury was told not to find Carani guilty of possession if he inadvertently acquired child pornography and subsequently made a conscious decision to keep it. The error in the supplemental instruction was harmless to Carani. Additionally, the use of the term \"strongly suspected\" in the supplemental instruction was proper given our analysis of the ostrich instruction.\n\nC. Distribution Enhancement\n\n\"We review the district court's interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, and its findings of fact for clear error.\" United States v. Fife, 471 F.3d 750, 752 (7th Cir.2006) (citing United States v. Ellis, 440 F.3d 434, 436 (7th Cir.2006)). \"A finding of fact is clearly erroneous only if, based upon the entire record, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" United States v. Chamness, 435 F.3d 724, 726 (7th Cir.2006) (citations and quotations omitted).\n\nUnder U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(a)(1), the base offense level for possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5) is eighteen. The government requested a five-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) for the \"[d]istribution [of child pornography] for the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of value, but not for pecuniary gain.\" The district court, instead, applied a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F) for \"[d]istribution other than distribution described in subdivisions (A) through (E).\" The district court applied a number of other enhancements that Carani does not take issue with, bringing his total offense level to thirty-five. This yields an advisory guidelines range of 168-210 months. The statutory maximum, however, is ten years (120 months). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2). Thus, the guidelines provide for a sentence of 120 months. After considering the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court sentenced Carani to seventy-two months' imprisonment followed by two years' supervised release.\n\nCarani makes two arguments with respect to the distribution enhancement: (1) that there was insufficient evidence that he distributed child pornography; and (2) that if he distributed child pornography, he did not do so for the receipt of a thing of value.\n\nThis court has not previously considered the exact contours of what constitutes \"distribution\" in the context of the Kazaa peer-to-peer file sharing program. The Tenth Circuit, however, recently held that allowing others to access one's files through Kazaa is distribution. United States v. Shaffer, 472 F.3d 1219 (10th Cir. 2007). The appellant in Shaffer, who was *876 convicted of distributing child pornography, argued that knowing that others were accessing and downloading the files on his computer through Kazaa did not amount to distribution. Id. at 1223. Rather, he argued, an affirmative act must be taken by the distributor for each file at the time of distribution. Id. The Tenth Circuit rejected this argument, likening distribution through Kazaa to the operation of a self-serve gas station: \"The owner may not be present at the station, and there may be no attendant present at all. And neither the owner nor his or her agents may ever pump gas. But the owner has a roadside sign letting all passerby know that, if they choose, they can stop and fill their cars for themselves, paying at the pump by credit card.\" Id. at 1223-24.\n\nThe notion that Carani could knowingly make his child pornography available for others to access and download without this qualifying as \"distribution\" does not square with the plain meaning of the word. Indeed, this court rejected a similar argument in United States v. Gunderson, where the defendant had programmed his computer to allow others to access his files if they first uploaded files to his computer. 345 F.3d 471, 473 (7th Cir.2003). Once the program was written, it required no action by Gunderson to allow others to download his files. Id. We described the passive nature of the program as \"irrelevant\" to whether a distribution enhancement was appropriate. Id. Such is the case here. The district court specifically found that Carani made his child pornography videos available through Kazaa, and that he knew other users were downloading these files from him. This finding was not clearly erroneous.\n\nCarani's second argument, that the distribution enhancement was not appropriate because he did not receive a thing of value in return, misstates the record and is a nonstarter. At sentencing, the government argued for a five-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B), which would require that Carani received something of value in return for the child pornography that he distributed. In his opening brief, Carani states: \"The court erred by applying the five-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B).\" The record clearly shows that the district court made no such enhancement. The district court applied a two-point enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(F), which does not require that Carani received anything in return for the child pornography he distributed. Thus, there is no factual basis for this argument.\n\nIII.

See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.011 (West Supp.2004-05) (sexual assault); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 15.01, 21.11 (West 2003) (criminal attempt, indecency with a child). Before the Court are the following motions and responses: Defendant Dodd's Motion To Suppress Evidence (Clerk's Document No. 13), Defendant's Motion To Suppress Search Based Upon Warrant # 1 (Clerk's Document No. 26), Defendant's Motion To Suppress Search Warrant # 2 (Clerk's Document No. 34), Defendant's Motion To Suppress Search Warrant # 3 (Clerk's Document No. 36), the Government's Memorandums Of Law In Opposition To Defendant's Motions To Suppress (Clerk's Document Nos. 33 and 40), the Government's letter brief dated September 13, 2004 (Clerk's Document No. 44) and Dodd's letter brief dated October 4, 2004 (Clerk's Document No. 46). On September 8, 2004, this Court held a hearing on Dodd's motions to suppress. The evidence at the hearing consisted of testimony from Sergeant Katherine Smith, an investigator with the Texas Attorney General's Office, transcripts of electronic communications between Smith and Dodd, in which Smith represented herself as a fourteen-year-old girl named \"Shelly Wright,\" and a photograph of Dodd's pickup truck.\n\nBy his motions, Dodd seeks to suppress evidence discovered by police officers during searches conducted pursuant to warrants of a hotel room registered in his name, his residence in Port Lavaca, Texas, and his computer, which was located in his residence. Dodd contends that because the affidavit supporting the initial warrant for the hotel room failed to contain sufficient reliable information upon which the reviewing magistrate could base a reasonable belief that evidence of the charged offense would be found in the listed hotel room, the search of the hotel room was improper, and evidence recovered therein should be suppressed. Additionally, Dodd contends that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule, as announced in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 923,  104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1984), does not apply, that the search of the hotel room was improper, and evidence recovered in the search should be suppressed. Finally, Dodd contends that because the search warrant for the hotel room was invalid due to a lack of probable cause and *1042 because the subsequent search warrants for his residence and his computer were based in part on evidence obtained during the improper search of the hotel room, evidence recovered in those searches is fruit of a poisonous tree and should also be suppressed. See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471,  83 S. Ct. 407, 9 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1963).\n\nAfter considering Dodd's motions, the evidence presented at the hearing, the Government's responses, the arguments of counsel, the parties' post-submission letters, and the applicable law, this Court concludes that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies and Dodd's motions to suppress should be denied.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAt the suppression hearing, Smith, a licensed Texas Peace Officer and an investigator with the Cyber Crimes Unit of the Texas Attorney General's Office, testified about the unit's investigation of Dodd. On December 4, 2003, at 1:30 p.m., while in the Attorney General's undercover computer laboratory, she signed on to the Internet Yahoo! chat group Texas 14, as \"ShellyWright 14.\" She created a fictitious Yahoo! account profile for \"Shelly Wright,\" which represented that Wright was a fourteen-year-old single female student.[1] Upon entering the chat group, she simply \"sat,\" such that online it appeared as if Wright was present in the chat group but not engaged in conversation with any other members of the group. At 1:42 p.m., Wright received a message from \"doilarryl_.\"[2] Smith testified that later, through Dodd's emails and his driver's license records, she was able to confirm that this was the screen name Dodd used when communicating online with Wright. The chat logs, which were admitted as evidence at the hearing, show that Dodd and Wright communicated via computer using instant messaging and email on nine days between December 4, 2003, and March 3, 2004. Dodd's initial online communication with Wright, as well as most of his other communications with her, involved conversation about sex or sexual acts. During his initial communication on December 4, Dodd asked Wright if she was a virgin and if she was curious about sex. He also asked her when she would be fifteen, to which Wright responded, \"in 15 days.\" Dodd asked Wright for a picture, and Smith responded by emailing Dodd a picture of a fully clothed young girl sitting on a couch with a dog, which Smith testified is a photograph often used in this type of undercover operation. A photograph of Dodd's face appeared on his Yahoo! profile. Also on December 4, Dodd emailed two pictures to Wright and told her that each one was of himself with an erect penis. In other online conversations, Dodd and Wright arranged to meet in Bastrop, Texas on January 6. Dodd failed to appear for their meeting and explained later that he was unable to make the meeting because he had been in the hospital. At Wright's suggestion, a second meeting was arranged at the Jack In The Box in Buda, Texas; however, Dodd failed to appear for that meeting as well. On March 1, 2004, in an online conversation, Dodd and Wright arranged a third meeting for Wednesday, March 3 at 10:30 a.m. at the Jack In The Box in Buda. In his March 1 online communication, Dodd told Wright *1043 that he would get a hotel room in San Marcos, Texas, pick her up at the Jack In the Box, and that they would go to the hotel room and have sex. He told Wright that he would bring condoms, lubricant, alcoholic beverages, and bubble bath to the hotel. Dodd told Wright that he would be driving a green F-150 pickup truck and she would be able to recognize him at the Jack In The Box from the picture posted on his Yahoo! profile.\n\nOn March 3 at 10:30 a.m., Smith and other police officers waited in an HEB parking lot adjacent to the Jack In The Box in Buda. Smith identified Dodd as he arrived at the Jack In The Box driving a green F-150 pickup truck. The other police officers immediately arrested Dodd. According to Smith, before giving Dodd his Miranda warnings[3] and as the officers searched Dodd incident to his arrest, the officers removed a hotel room key from Dodd's pocket and asked him where was the hotel room. Dodd responded that the hotel room was at the Stratford Inn in San Marcos.\n\nBased on the information Smith obtained through her undercover investigation and the events at the Jack In The Box, she prepared a search-warrant affidavit on March 3 for room 114 of the Stratford Inn in San Marcos. Although, it is unclear from Smith's affidavit and from her testimony at the suppression hearing, the Court assumes that police officers learned from employees of the Stratford Inn that Dodd was registered for room 114. Smith presented her affidavit to the Honorable Howard Warner, Judge of the County Court At Law No. 1 of Hays County, Texas, and he signed the search warrant that afternoon. Smith, along with other police officers, executed the warrant and recovered from the hotel room one unopened box of Magnum condoms, one tube of K-Y Jelly personal lubricant, one unopened box of Trojan ENZ condoms, one unopened box of Durex condoms, four bottles of TGIF Pina Colada alcoholic beverage, two small bottles of Red Label scotch, one bottle of Lander Aloe Vera bubble bath, and an 8-1/2\" x 11\" color photograph of the file \"Shelly.jpg.\"[4]\n\nAfter executing the search warrant, Smith drafted an affidavit seeking a search warrant for Dodd's Port Lavaca residence. The Honorable Alex Hernandez, Judge of the County Court at Law of Calhoun County, Texas, signed a search warrant authorizing officers to search Dodd's residence. Based on what the officers recovered in their search of Dodd's residence, on March 5 Smith drafted an affidavit seeking a search warrant for Dodd's computers and diskettes seized from the residence. The Honorable Julie Kocurek, Judge of the 390th District Court of Travis County, Texas, signed a search warrant authorizing officers to search the seized computers and diskettes.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nSearch of hotel room\n\nDodd contends initially that the evidence seized in the March 3 search of room 114 of the Stratford Inn must be suppressed because Smith's supporting affidavit failed to establish probable cause to believe that evidence of criminal activity would be found in this particular hotel room. Dodd contends that Smith's supporting affidavit is deficient because it lacks any facts that *1044 state why she believed room 114 was registered to Dodd, or alternatively, that the affidavit lacks any information establishing a nexus between room 114 and the evidence Smith believed would be recovered there. Further, Dodd contends that the good-faith exception does not apply because the warrant fails to provide any indicia of probable cause to search room 114, and that Judge Warner must have abandoned his neutral, disinterested judicial role when issuing the warrant. Finally, Dodd contends that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply because Smith knew that police officers found the hotel room key in Dodd's pocket pursuant to their search incident to Dodd's arrest, asked him where the hotel room was, and Dodd told them, all while Dodd was under arrest but before he was given his Miranda warnings.\n\nThe Government disagrees with Dodd's contentions and responds that the affidavit is facially valid and that the facts alleged therein provided probable cause to search the hotel room. Additionally, the Government contends that if the affidavit was insufficient because it failed to provide a substantial basis for probable cause to issue the warrant, the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies and the motion to suppress evidence recovered in the hotel room should be denied.\n\nSupporting affidavit for hotel-room search warrant\n\nSmith's affidavit describes the place to be searched as \"1601 IH 35 North, Room # 114, San Marcos, Hays County, Texas 78666.\" Smith further describes the Stratford Inn and the location of room 114 with particularity. Smith states that it is her belief that, among other things, cameras, photographs, computer files, condoms, lubricant, alcoholic beverages, and bubble bath, business records, and documents referencing Wright or Larry Dodd would be found in room 114. In the probable-cause portion of the affidavit, Smith describes her specialized background and training regarding the seizure and analysis of computer equipment and the investigation of crimes committed using the Internet. Among other things, she notes that she is a certified and licensed Texas Peace Officer with over eight years of law enforcement experience and is currently assigned to the Cyber Crimes Unit of the Texas Attorney General's Office. Her work for the Attorney General has focused exclusively on child-exploitation crimes. The vast majority of the investigations in which she has participated have involved the use of computers and the Internet to facilitate child exploitation crimes.\n\nRegarding the investigation of Dodd, her affidavit explains that while in the Cyber Crimes Unit's undercover computer laboratory on December 4, 2003, at 1:30 p.m., she accessed the Internet and signed on to \"www.yahoo.com.\" Smith states that she uses an undercover account to access chat groups and rooms. In this session, Smith posed as a fourteen-year-old female named Wright. Smith describes the Yahoo! profile she established as Wright which indicates that Wright would be fifteen years old the next month. Smith explained chat groups and stated that on December 4, posing as Wright, she joined the Yahoo! \"Texas 14\" chat group. After joining the group, Smith stated that the name \"ShellyWright14\" appeared on the chat group user list. The list shows all the members currently in the chat room. Smith did not initiate online contact with any members and simply left \"ShellyWright14\" signed on to the chat group list.\n\nOn December 4 at 1:42 p.m., Smith received an unsolicited online individual message from Dodd that stated, \"excuse me, r *1045 u busy?\"[5] Smith's affidavit explained that others in the chat room are unable to access or view such an individual message and that this type of message can only be viewed by the two members communicating with each other. Smith's affidavit continues, and states that at 1:43, Dodd asked Wright if she was fifteen to which Wright replied that she was fourteen. During this chat session, Dodd asked Wright for a picture. Smith stated that she sent a picture \"depicting a thirteen-year-old white female used for undercover purposes\" to Dodd via email. After receiving the picture, Dodd wrote \"shelly your so cute.\" Smith stated that she viewed the Yahoo! Instant Messenger profile for doilarryl_. Smith's affidavit also describes several sexually explicit communications between she and Dodd. She notes that on December 4 at 1:53 p.m. Dodd writes Wright, \"I have dated 16 before\" and \"I like to teach young lady.\" At 1:58 p.m., Dodd asks Wright what grade she is in and she replies that she is in the 9th grade. At 2:50 p.m. Dodd writes, \"if we stay friends I will show u things sometime w.o intercourse.\" At 2:56 p.m. Dodd sent Wright two pictures via email; the first \"depicts a male lying on his back holding his erect penis\" and the second \"depicts a nude male standing with a semi-erect penis apparently masturbating.\" At 2:57 p.m. Dodd writes Wright that the pictures were of himself. Wright and Dodd had several instant messaging conversations between December 4 and March 1, 2004. On several occasions Dodd told Wright that he would \"teach\" her about sex. On December 8, Dodd writes to Wright and asks about possibly meeting in person. During the conversations, Dodd asks Wright if he could meet her and engage in sexual conduct. Smith, as Wright, responded that she had not had sex before. During this conversation, Dodd asked Wright to engage in sexual contact and sexual intercourse. Smith's affidavit describes Dodd's plan that he communicated to Wright as follows:\n\nDodd would obtain a hotel room in San Marcos and that on Wednesday, March 3, 2004, he would meet her at the Jack In The Box in Buda, Texas. [Dodd] told [Wright] that they would then return to the hotel room to engage in sexual intercourse. [Dodd] told [Wright] that he would bring condoms, lubricant, alcoholic beverages, and bubble bath to the meeting.\nSmith also stated that as \"defined by Texas Penal Code section 21.01, sexual contact is defined as any touching of the anus, breast, or any part of the genitals of another person with intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person. Sexual intercourse is defined as any penetration of the female sex organ by the male sex organ.\" Smith stated that she has saved all of the profiles, chat logs and photographs and placed them in the investigative case file. Further Smith states,\n\nOn Wednesday March 3, [Dodd] arrived at the predetermined location intending to meet and engage in sexual conduct with whom he believed was a minor female child. After positive identification by [Smith], [Dodd] was immediately arrested. [Dodd] was driving a green 1997 Ford F150 automobile; TX LP #9PTV07. [Dodd] was read his Miranda Warning and requested that a lawyer be present prior to being questioned.\nSmith stated that she did not question Dodd. Dodd's vehicle was inventoried and *1046 seized. In the rear floor of the truck, a color photograph depicting a nude male with an erect penis was found. The photograph was identical to the first one sent to Wright by Dodd as doilarryl_ on December 4, 2003.\n\nSmith stated that from her experience and training, she \"knows that persons who use personal computers tend to retain their personal files and data for extended periods of time, months or even years.\" Smith stated that she knows personal-computer users transfer most of their data to new computers when making an upgrade. Finally, she stated,\n\nbased on all the foregoing, there is probable cause to believe that evidence and instrumentalities in violation of Texas Penal Code Section 22.011 Criminal Attempt-Sexual Assault of a Child are contained, concealed, or maintained in files, electronic or otherwise, correspondence, notes, papers, ledgers, personal telephone and address books, maps, memoranda, telexes, facsimilies, documents or concealed in equipment located at 1601 IH 35 North, Room # 114, San Marcos, Hays County, Texas 78666.\nJudge Warner signed the search warrant, and Smith and other police officers executed the warrant the afternoon of March 3. From room 114 of the Stratford Inn in San Marcos, they recovered one unopened box of Magnum condoms, one tube of K-Y Jelly personal lubricant, one unopened box of Trojan ENZ condoms, one unopened box of Durex condoms, four bottles of TGIF Pina Colada alcoholic beverage, two small bottles of Red Label scotch and one bottle of Lander' Aloe Vera bubble bath.\n\nApplicable law\n\nCertain fundamental principles apply when a defendant argues that evidence, seized upon the execution of a search warrant, must be suppressed because the supporting affidavit did not establish the existence of probable cause. The Fourth Amendment, which provides that \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation,\" requires that probable cause be determined \"by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out federal crime.\" U.S. Const, amend. IV; Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 14,  68 S. Ct. 367, 92 L. Ed. 436 (1948). In order for a magistrate to perform his official function, the affidavit must contain adequate supporting facts about the underlying circumstances to show that probable cause exists for the issuance of the warrant. Whiteley v. Warden, 401 U.S. 560, 564,  91 S. Ct. 1031, 28 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1971). Probable cause has been defined as \"only a probability, and not a prima facie showing, of criminal activity.\" Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 235, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983). A warrant must be upheld as long as the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that a search would uncover evidence of wrongdoing. Id. at 238-39, 103 S. Ct. 2317. To justify a search, the circumstances must indicate why evidence of illegal activity will be found in a particular place; the affidavit must connect the place to be searched with the illegal activity and the evidence sought. United States v. Pace, 955 F.2d 270, 276-77 (5th Cir.1992). This nexus may be established \"through normal inferences as to where the articles sought would be located.\" Id. at 277 (quoting United States v. Freeman, 685 F.2d 942, 949 (5th Cir.1982)).\n\nIn reviewing suppression motions, courts have the discretion to proceed directly to an analysis of the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule announced in United States v. Leon, without first addressing the underlying Fourth Amendment *1047 question. 468 U.S. at 924-25, 104 S. Ct. 3405. In the Fifth Circuit, generally, a search warrant is reviewed in two stages. See United States v. Payne, 341 F.3d 393, 399 (5th Cir.2003). First, a court determines whether the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies. Id. If it does, the court need not reach the question of probable cause for the warrant unless it presents a \"novel question of law, resolution of which is necessary to guide future action by law enforcement officers and magistrates.\" Id. Due to the facts peculiar to this case, the Court will first review the Fourth Amendment question, determining whether the affidavit on its face established a substantial basis for probable cause to search room 114, and will then proceed to determine whether the goodfaith exception applies.\n\nSubstantial basis for probable-cause finding by magistrate\n\nWhen determining whether Smith's affidavit established probable cause to believe evidence of a crime would be found in room 114, Judge Warner was required to review the totality of the circumstances in a practical and common sense fashion. See Gates, 462 U.S. at 230-31, 103 S. Ct. 2317; Pace, 955 F.2d at 277. What is required before a magistrate issues a warrant is that the magistrate must conclude that the facts and circumstances described in the affidavit would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that the articles sought were located at the place proposed to be searched. See Pace, 955 F.2d at 276. In the review of the search at issue, this Court affords deference to Judge Warner's finding of probable cause and his finding will be sustained should this Court determine it was a doubtful or marginal decision. See Gates, 462 U.S. at 236, 103 S. Ct. 2317. Where oral testimony was not presented to the reviewing magistrate, as in this case, the existence of probable cause to support a warrant must be ascertained exclusively from the four corners of the affidavit. See Whiteley, 401 U.S. at 565 n. 8, 91 S. Ct. 1031.\n\nThis Court finds that although Smith's affidavit describes the particular place to be searched in detail, the affidavit failed to provide Judge Warner with any necessary facts from which he could infer that Dodd was associated with room 114 of the Stratford Inn or any facts from which he could infer that evidence of the offense charged would be found in that particular hotel room or even in that hotel. Smith's affidavit mentions only that Dodd said that he would \"get a hotel room in San Marcos.\" The affidavit provides no facts that link Dodd to room 114 or a particular hotel, nor any information from which such an inference could be drawn. Although Smith testified at the suppression hearing that police officers located a key in Dodd's pocket during their search incident to his arrest that Dodd identified as belonging to the Stratford Inn, Smith failed to include this information in her search-warrant affidavit. Specifically, the affidavit fails to provide a link between Dodd and room 114 at the Stratford Inn. The affidavit adequately describes the hotel and room and asserts that \"Larry Winston Dodd\" is in charge of and controls the room. The affidavit also specifically describes the items expected to be found in the room and indicates that some of the items sought may \"reference... doilarryl_, or Larry Dodd.\" In setting forth her probable cause for issuance of the warrant, Smith recites many of the facts known to her concerning the internet correspondence between Dodd and Wright, but fails to ever mention Dodd by name, referring to him only as \"Suspect/doilarryl_.\" Her description of the \"Yahoo Instant Messenger profile\" for \"Suspect/doilarryl_\" reflects the \"Real Name\" of the suspect as only \"Larry.\" In *1048 describing the circumstances of Dodd's arrest, she refers to him only as \"Suspect/doilarryl_.\" In no place does the affidavit state that the \"Larry Winston Dodd\" alleged to control room 114 of the Stratford Inn in San Marcos is the same person as \"Suspect/doilarryl_,\" suspected of child exploitation crimes, who, when arrested in Buda had on his person a room key for the Stratford Inn in San Marcos. Without this affirmative link in the affidavit, probable cause cannot exist to search the specific place described in the affidavit. To rule otherwise could foreseeably lead to the validation of search warrants for random locations in no way factually associated with a suspect, but which law enforcement officers only have a mere surmise or suspicion that the suspect may have visited. The Constitution requires more.\n\nThis Court does not doubt that Smith possessed the necessary information to obtain a valid search warrant. However, she failed to present it to the issuing magistrate either by affidavit or by direct oral statement. It is the finding of this Court that Smith's affidavit lacked facts necessary to link Dodd and the evidence of the offense charged, which Smith was seeking, to room 114 of the Stratford Inn in San Marcos, and further that Judge Warner's finding of probable cause to issue the warrant was without a substantial basis. See Gates, 462 U.S. at 238-39, 103 S. Ct. 2317 (task of issuing magistrate is to determine, given all circumstances set forth in affidavit, whether fair probability exists that evidence of crime will be found in particular place; task of reviewing court is to ensure that substantial basis existed for magistrate's probable-cause finding).\n\nGood-faith exception\n\nAlthough this Court has determined that the search warrant lacked a substantial basis for Judge Warner's probable-cause finding, the evidence seized from the hotel room need not be suppressed if the executing police officer acted with an objective good-faith belief that the warrant was properly issued by a neutral magistrate. See Leon, 468 U.S. at 922,104 S. Ct. 3405.\n\nUnited States v. Leon stands for the principle that courts should not render inadmissible evidence obtained by police officers who acted in reasonable reliance upon a search warrant that is ultimately found to be unsupported by probable cause. Id. at 923, 104 S. Ct. 3405. The Leon good-faith exception requires suppression \"only if the officers were dishonest or reckless in preparing their affidavit or could not have harbored an objectively reasonable belief in the existence of probable cause.\" Id. at 926, 104 S. Ct. 3405. The Leon court outlined four instances when the good-faith exception cannot apply and evidence will be excluded: (1) the affidavit contained materially false information that the officer affiant either knew was false or would have known was false if he or she had not been reckless; (2) the magistrate abandoned his neutral role in evaluating the affidavit; (3) the affidavit is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render the officer's belief in its existence entirely unreasonable; or (4) the warrant is so facially deficient in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid. Id. at 923-25, 104 S. Ct. 3405. The Court noted that the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter unlawful police misconduct; therefore, when officers engage in \"objectively reasonable law enforcement activity\" and have acted in good faith when obtaining a search warrant from a judge or magistrate, the good-faith exception applies. Id. at 919-20, 104 S. Ct. 3405.\n\n*1049 Dodd contends that the good-faith exception does not apply because the warrant fails to provide any indicia of probable cause to search a particular room in a particular hotel, and that Judge Warner must have abandoned his neutral, disinterested role when issuing this warrant. Finally, Dodd contends that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule does not apply because the police officers found the hotel room key in Dodd's pocket pursuant to their search incident to Dodd's arrest, asked him where the hotel room was, and Dodd told them, all while Dodd was under arrest but before he was given his Miranda warnings.\n\nIn considering whether the good-faith exception applies, this Court does not attempt an \"expedition into the minds of police officers\" to determine their subjective belief regarding the validity of the warrant. Id. at 922 n. 23, 104 S. Ct. 3405. Rather, this Court's inquiry is \"confined to the objectively ascertainable question of whether a reasonably well-trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the magistrate's authorization.\" Id. In determining whether the good-faith exception applies, the court examines the affidavit and may also consider all of the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the warrant. See Payne, 341 F.3d at 400 (citing Leon, 468 U.S. at 922 n. 23,104 S. Ct. 3405).\n\nExceptions to good-faith exception\n\n1. Affidavit lacks indicia of probable cause\n\nFirst, this Court addresses whether Smith's affidavit was \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\" Leon, 468 U.S. at 923, 104 S. Ct. 3405. Smith's affidavit is not a \"bare-bones\" affidavit.[6] Despite the affidavit's deficiencies in linking room 114 of the Stratford Inn to Dodd and criminal activity, it was not unreasonable for Smith to believe that what she wrote in the affidavit would be sufficient to support a finding of probable cause. Additionally, when evaluating whether to apply the good-faith exception, this Court considers Smith's personal knowledge regarding the investigation and the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the warrant. See Payne, 341 F.3d at 402. The affidavit contained sufficient indicia of probable cause to enable a reasonable officer to execute the warrant thinking it valid. See United States v. Martin, 297 F.3d 1308, 1315 (11th Cir. 2002) (citing United States v. Hodge, 246 F.3d 301, 309 (3rd Cir.2001)) (\"At a minimum the affidavit was not clearly lacking in indicia of probable cause, but presented a close call. Once the magistrate judge made that call, it was objectively reasonable for the officers to rely on it.\").\n\n2. Reviewing magistrate abandoned his judicial role\n\nNext the Court addresses Dodd's contention that the good-faith exception does not apply because Judge Warner must have wholly abandoned his judicial role by finding that Smith's affidavit provided probable cause to issue the search warrant. A search warrant must be reviewed by \"a neutral and detached magistrate\" before it can be executed. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 450, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 29 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1971). This separate review by a member of the judiciary protects individuals from the sometimes \"hurried judgment of a law enforcement officer engaged in the often *1050 competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime\" and serves as \"a more reliable safeguard against improper searches.\" Lo-Ji Sales, Inc. v. New York, 442 U.S. 319, 326, 99 S. Ct. 2319, 60 L. Ed. 2d 920 (1979). \"The courts must ... insist that the magistrate purport to perform his neutral and detached function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police\" in determining whether a warrant contains sufficient probable cause. Leon, 468 U.S. at 914, 104 S. Ct. 3405. A judge can be said to act as a mere \"rubber stamp\" if he solely relies upon the fact that police officers are asking for the warrant. Martin, 297 F.3d at 1317. \"Whatever else neutrality and detachment might entail, it is clear that they require severance and disengagement from activities of law enforcement.\" Id. (quoting Shadwick v. City of Tampa, 407 U.S. 345, 350, 92 S. Ct. 2119, 32 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1972)).\n\nThere was no evidence presented at the suppression hearing indicating that Judge Warner wholly abandoned his judicial role. Nothing before this Court indicates that Judge Warner failed to read the affidavit or that he issued the warrant solely relying on the fact that Smith asked for it. Further, this Court declines to infer that because Judge Warner's probable-cause finding lacked a substantial basis, his act of issuing the warrant was a \"rubber stamp.\" Martin, 297 F.3d at 1318 (citing United States v. Tagbering, 985 F.2d 946, 951 (8th Cir.1993)). This Court concludes that there is no evidence that Judge Warner wholly abandoned his judicial role when issuing the search warrant for room 114.\n\n3. Omission of information from affidavit\n\nThe good-faith exception does not apply when an affiant omits information in her possession that would have weakened the case against the defendant. See United States v. Davis, 226 F.3d 346, 351 (5th Cir.2000). Here the omission would have strengthened the case against Dodd. Any omission must be of information that is not only relevant, but dispositive, so that if the omitted facts had been included in the affidavit, there would not be probable cause. Davis, 226 F.3d at 351.\n\nAt the suppression hearing, Smith testified that, to the extent she omitted information linking Dodd to room 114 of the Stratford Inn, it was a mere oversight. There exists no evidence that Smith deliberately or recklessly misled Judge Warner in any manner by omitting information from her affidavit. Further, there is no evidence nor any indication that Smith intentionally omitted facts that would have defeated a finding of probable cause. On the contrary, the facts Smith omitted would have provided additional support for the issuance of the warrant. See Martin, 297 F.3d at 1320.\n\nReasonable reliance on warrant\n\nHaving determined that none of the exceptions to the Leon good-faith exception apply, the Court reviews whether Smith reasonably relied upon the search warrant. The good-faith exception requires the court to consider objectively whether a reasonably well-trained officer would know that the warrant was illegal despite the magistrate's authorization. Leon, 468 U.S. at 922 n. 23, 104 S. Ct. 3405. The question arises whether this Court may consider information outside the four corners of the affidavit that was known to Smith and not presented in the affidavit.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit holds that in determining whether the good-faith exception applies, the reviewing court may consider \"the affidavit and the circumstances surrounding issuance of the warrant.\" Payne, 341 F.3d at 402. Further, a majority of circuits have taken into consideration *1051 facts outside the affidavit when determining whether the Leon good-faith exception applies. See United States v. Martin, 297 F.3d 1308, 1319 (11th Cir.2002) (citing United States v. Marion, 238 F.3d 965, 969 (8th Cir.2001); United States v. Danhauer, 229 F.3d 1002, 1007 (10th Cir.2000); United States v. Procopio, 88 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir.1996); United States v. Gahagan, 865 F.2d 1490, 1498 (6th Cir.1989); United States v. Owens, 848 F.2d 462, 466 (4th Cir.1988); United States v. Word, No. 00-2688, 2001 WL 13133 (7th Cir. Jan. 2, 2001) (not designated for publication)). This Court, reviewing the totality of the circumstances, and considering that Smith was involved in all aspects of the investigation of Dodd, finds that she reasonably believed that probable cause existed to execute a search warrant for room 114.\n\nQuestioning of Dodd before Miranda warnings given\n\nDodd contends that the evidence recovered in room 114 should be suppressed because police officers improperly questioned Dodd about the room key, and Dodd answered before the officers gave Dodd his Miranda warnings. Smith testified that on March 3 police officers arrested Dodd immediately after she identified him driving into the parking lot of the Jack In The Box in Buda. The officers recovered a key in Dodd's pocket during their search incident to Dodd's arrest. Before giving Dodd his Miranda warnings, the officers asked him where the hotel room was and Dodd responded that it was at the Stratford Inn in San Marcos.[7]\n\nThe Supreme Court recently addressed the Miranda rule and held that a failure to give a suspect Miranda warnings does not require suppression of the physical fruits of the suspect's unwarned but voluntary statements. United States v. Patane, ___ U.S. ___, 124 S. Ct. 2620, 2626, 159 L. Ed. 2d 667 (2004) (emphasis added). Further, the Patane court held that potential violations occur, if at all, only upon the admission of coerced or involuntary unwarned statements into evidence. Id. at 2628. Here, there is no evidence that Dodd's statement was coerced nor is there any indication that his statement was given involuntarily. This Court finds that the police officers' failure to give Dodd his Miranda warnings before asking him where the hotel room was and Dodd's answering them does not prevent the admission into evidence of the subsequently discovered evidence in room 114, which was the fruit of his voluntary statement.\n\nIssues regarding search of Dodd's residence and computers\n\nDodd also challenges the searches, pursuant to warrants, of his residence and his computer. He contends that because Smith's supporting affidavits for these warrants reference improperly seized evidence from the search of room 114, evidence recovered in the search of his residence and his computer was also recovered illegally and should be suppressed as the fruit of the poisonous tree. See Wong Sun, 371 U.S. at 471, 83 S. Ct. 407. Because this Court concludes that the search of room 114 was valid, this Court will deny Dodd's motions to suppress evidence recovered in the searches of his residence and his computer.\n\n*1052 CONCLUSION\n\nThis Court's conclusion that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies in this case is guided by the rule's purpose-to deter unlawful police misconduct. See United States v. Peltier, 422 U.S. 531, 539, 95 S. Ct. 2313, 45 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1975). The exclusionary rule was created to guard against police officers who purposely omit critical facts from searchwarrant affidavits because such facts would not support a finding of probable cause. See Martin, 297 F.3d at 1320. This is not the case here. This Court finds that Smith acted in objective good faith when applying for and executing the warrant. This Court finds that Smith did not intentionally omit facts from her affidavit, what she did omit would have increased the likelihood that a magistrate would issue a search warrant, and that Judge Warner maintained his neutral role in issuing the search warrant for room 114. Dodd's motion to suppress the evidence recovered in room 114 will be denied.\n\nAccordingly,\n\nIT IS ORDERED that Defendant Larry Winston Dodd's Motions To Suppress (Clerk's Document Nos. 13, 26, 34, and 36) are DENIED.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] When discussing internet conversations, \"Wright\" will be used to identify the fictitious \"Shelly Wright\" with the email address of \"ShellyWright 14\" created by Smith.\n\n[2] The evidence presented at the September 8, 2004 hearing conclusively established that \"doilarryl_\" was an internet name used by Dodd. For clarity this Court will use \"Dodd\" to identify the Defendant.\n\n[3] See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).\n\n[4] \"Shelly.jpg\" is the name of the computer file that was attached to an email Smith sent to Dodd on December 4, 2003. The file consisted of the picture of a young girl sitting on a couch with a dog.\n\n[5] Throughout these exchanges, Dodd used his internet name, \"doilarryl_.\" See supra note 2.\n\n[6] An affidavit is \"bare bones\" if it is so deficient in demonstrating probable cause that it renders an officer's belief in its existence completely unreasonable. See United States v. Craig, 861 F.2d 818, 821 (5th Cir. 1988).\n\n[7] The cases cited to this Court by the Government in its post-submission letter are distinguishable from the facts presented because in each of its cases the defendant's pre-Miranda statement was referred to explicitly in the supporting affidavit for the search warrant; here Dodd's statement was not. See United States v. Gonzalez-Sandoval, 894 F.2d 1043, 1048 (9th Cir. 1990); United States v. Lemon, 550 F.2d 467 (9th Cir. 1977); United States v. Patterson, 812 F.2d 1188 (9th Cir.1987). Additionally, Dodd's post-submission letter fails to direct this Court to any authority for its position.", "annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 60}, {"start": 61, "end": 87}, {"start": 88, "end":

For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM Bowker's convictions and sentence, but REMAND to the district court for a ruling on Bowker's motion to return seized property.\n\n2\n* Facts\n\nA. Procedural History\n\n3\nOn August 28, 2001, United States Magistrate Judge George J. Limbert signed a criminal complaint charging Erik. S. Bowker (\"Bowker\") with one count of telephone harassment in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C). Bowker was arrested on August 29, 2001. On September 7, 2001, the magistrate judge held a preliminary examination and detention hearing for Bowker. The magistrate judge determined that probable cause for Bowker's arrest had been established, and he ordered Bowker detained.\n\n4\nOn September 25, 2001, a federal grand jury returned a four-count indictment against Bowker. Bowker was charged with one count of interstate stalking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A(1); one count of cyberstalking, in violation of 18U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A(2); one count of theft of mail, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708; and one count of telephone harassment, in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C).\n\n5\nBowker filed several pretrial motions which are the subject of this appeal \u2014 a pro se motion to represent himself, a motion to dismiss Counts 1, 2, and 4 of the indictment, a motion to sever Count 3 from the indictment, a motion to suppress evidence, and a pro se motion for return of seized property and items, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The district court denied all of the foregoing motions, except for the motion to return seized property, on which the district court never ruled. On March 26, 2002, after the denial of Bowker's pro se motion to represent himself, Bowker's counsel moved to withdraw from the case, and Bowker signed a separate statement asking the court to grant the motion and assign him new counsel. The district court granted the motion and assigned Bowker new counsel.\n\n6\nBowker's jury trial commenced on June 3, 2002. On June 6, 2002, the jury returned verdicts of guilty against Bowker on all counts. On September 5, 2002, the government moved for an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines based on the victim's extreme psychological harm. On September 10, 2002, the district court sentenced Bowker to 96 months' incarceration, three years of supervised release, and a $400 special assessment. In assessing the term of incarceration, the district court granted the government's motion for an upward departure.\n\nB. Substantive Facts\n\n7\nIn March, 2000, Tina Knight began working as a part-time general assignment reporter at WKBN Television in Youngstown, Ohio. WKBN has a general email account for most employees, and in June, 2000, WKBN received a number of emails relating to Knight. The emails were sent from several different email addresses and purported to be from an individual variously identified as \"User x,\" Eric Neubauer, Karen Walters, and \"BB.\" Several of the emails attached photographs with verbal captions. One caption referred to Knight being shot with a pellet gun, and another email said, \"Thanks for my daily Tina Knight fix. Thanks for helping me get my nuts off,\" and another said \"More Tina Knight, that is what I want and need.\" After receiving approximately nine of these types of email, WKBN's news director took them to the station's general manager. They then contacted Special Agent Deane Hassman of the FBI. Soon thereafter, Knight was shown the emails, and she was stunned and frightened.\n\n8\nFBI Agent Hassman began investigating the Tina Knight emails in July, 2000. Hassman was concerned about Knight's personal safety based on the content of the emails. One of the emails that concerned Hassman stated, \"I'm not the type of obsessed viewer that hides in the bushes near your home to watch you come home from work, but we shall see. That may actually be fun.\" Another disturbing email stated, in part, \"Dear Ms. Knight. Now I'm really pissed that you were looking even cuter than normally. You fucked up a little bit and here I am watching on this black and white thrift store TV. Cute, cute, cute. I bet you were a Ho at Ohio University in Athens, doing chicks and everything. Wow.\"\n\n9\nOn July 25, 2000, Hassman sent emails to the various email addresses on the correspondence pertaining to Knight. Hassman asked the sender of the emails to contact him so that he could determine the sender's intent. Within 24 to 48 hours, Hassman received a telephone call from an individual who identified himself as Erik Bowker. Hassman wanted to set up a meeting with Bowker so Hassman could positively identify the sender of the emails and also ask him to cease and desist from contacting Knight. They arranged to meet at the public library in Youngstown, but Bowker never showed.\n\n10\nA few weeks later, Knight began receiving hand-written notes at WKBN, the majority of which were signed by \"Doug Wagner.\" By September, the letters were arriving at the station almost every couple of days. One of the letters included the phrase, \"All this week I will be playing the role of Doug Wagner.\" A letter dated August 9, 2000 was signed \"Chad Felton\"; stated, \"I think you are a super babe\"; and included a necklace. The return addresses on the letters were one of two P.O. Boxes registered to Erik Bowker or his mother.\n\n11\nKnight left her employment at WKBN in November, 2000 to take a position at WOWK CBS13 in Charleston, West Virginia. WKBN did not inform the general public of Knight's new location.\n\n12\nIn late December, 2000, Knight's parents, who reside in Medina, Ohio, received a card and a handwritten note at their home. The card purported to be from \"Kathryn Harris.\" The letter read, \"Dear Tina Knight: I am Kathryn Harris today. I didn't want your parents asking you a lot of questions, nor did I want to attract a lot of attention to you. My letters to you are all online at yahoo.com in a standard mail account. It is all explained there so please check in and read what I have written.... The E-mail address is tinahatesme@yahoo.com.\" Agent Hassman visited the email address to check if any letters had been sent to the email address mentioned in the letter. Hassman discovered that an email had been sent December 25, 2000. At the end of the email, the name \"Doug Wagner\" was typed. The email read, in part, \"I told you I would not contact you by mail anymore but I am sorry, I am in agony. I'm thinking about you all the time. You really are my dream girl.... I am blinded with affection for you. I did not ask for this. Nope, it's all your fault.... Please don't cat dance on my emotions by failing to respond to me at all.\"\n\n13\nIn February, 2001, Bowker filed a lawsuit against Knight in the Mahoning County Common Pleas Court. Knight's social security number was stated in the complaint, which was served at Knight's home address in West Virginia. Bowker's lawsuit accused Knight of stalking him. Agent Hassman attended a status conference for the lawsuit on March 16, 2001, so that he could make face-to-face contact with Bowker. After meeting Bowker at the hearing and confirming that Bowker had been sending the unsolicited correspondence to Knight, Hassman told Bowker that the correspondence was unwelcome and might be a violation of federal law. Hassman advised Bowker that if the conduct continued, it might result in his arrest. Bowker responded that he had a First Amendment right to engage in that type of conduct. Nevertheless, during the meeting, Bowker wrote and signed a note stating, \"I understand that Tina M. Knight wishes all further contact with her or any family member to stop and I agree to do so, pursuant to conversation with Deane Hassman, special agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation....\" Bowker also agreed to voluntarily dismiss his lawsuit against Knight.\n\n14\nDespite Bowker's March, 16, 2001 agreement to cease and desist from any further contact with Knight, on that very same day, Bowker mailed a letter to Knight. Bowker also continued to attempt telephone contact with Knight. Between January 26 and August 29, 2001, Bowker made 146 telephone calls from his cell phone to WOWK CBS 13, where Knight worked. Bowker also made 16 calls to Knight's personal residential telephone in West Virginia between August 11 and 28, 2001. Knight's number was unlisted and unpublished. According to telephone records, each of the 16 calls placed to Knight's home were preceded by *67, which enables a caller to block identification of his telephone number on the recipient's caller identification display. Bowker also called Knight's co-worker and a neighbor.\n\n15\nAs the telephone calls to Knight's television station persisted through the summer of 2001, Agent Hassman believed it was important to capture Bowker's voice on tape, so Hassman provided Knight with a recording device at the television station. On June 12, 2001, Knight recorded a 45 minute telephone call from Bowker who, at one point, identified himself as \"Mike.\" During the conversation, Bowker referred to Knight's neighbors, her family members and her social security number. He also indicated he might be watching Knight with his binoculars. Knight provided the tape to the FBI and never spoke to Bowker again on the telephone.\n\n16\nOn July 16, 2001, Knight received a letter at the television station. In the letter, Bowker referred to Knight's parents and stated several times, \"You do not hang up on me.\" The letter also crassly referred to Knight's car, threatened to file a mechanic's lien on her car and her co-worker's car, accused Knight and her colleague of being \"fuck-ups, assholes and seriously emotional and mentally unbalanced,\" and contained numerous sexual references. The letter stated that Bowker would be contacting Knight's neighbors, pointed out that Knight had not registered her car in West Virginia, and concluded with the words, \"So bye-by, fuck you, you are an asshole and a sociopath and an embarrassment to mothers everywhere sir.... Adios, Eric.... Smooch, Smooch.\"\n\n17\nOn August 10, 2001, Knight received a certified letter mailed to her residence in West Virginia. Accompanying the letter were numerous photographs of Bowker at various locations in West Virginia, Knight's home state. The letter stated, in part, \"Send me an E-Mail address. It keeps me long distance, you know what I mean.\" Knight forwarded the letter and the photographs to the FBI. Bowker's credit card statement later revealed purchases from a Kmart and a Kroger near Knight's place of employment and residence in West Virginia between June 12 and July 30, 2001.\n\n18\nIn August 2001, Bowker left a series of messages on Knight's answering machine asking that Knight or Knight's friend call him back, which did not occur. Among other things, Bowker stated:\n\n19\nI don't even know why I'm nice to you ever at all, you and your fucked-up friend should not even be working in the media. You know you gotta mother-fucking realize there's like 50 percent men in this country and you better mother-fucking learn that you're going to have to deal with us sometime....\n\n20\nWell, it looks like nobody is going to answer me if Tina Knight is okay, so I'm gonna take the 1:00 a.m. bus out of Columbus, Ohio and come down there and see for myself. Okay, I'll be there about 6:00 a.m. Bye.\n\n21\nKnight testified that these messages made her afraid to leave the house everyday, and she feared that Bowker might try to rape her. She gave the answering machine recordings to the FBI.\n\n22\nBowker was arrested on August 29, 2001 at a self-storage facility in Youngstown where he kept some of his possessions. Among other things recovered from the storage facility, Bowker's car and other locations, were a police scanner set to the frequency of the Youngstown Police Department, a paper with scanner frequencies from the Dunbar, West Virginia Police Department, letters bearing the name \"Chad Felton,\" a credit report for Tina Knight, Knight's birth certificate, a map of Dunbar, West Virginia, Greyhound bus schedules with West Virginia routes, and photos taken by Bowker during a West Virignia trip on July 11, 2001, which included pictures of Knight's place of work, her car and CBS news trucks. The FBI also discovered that Bowker had in his possession a Discover Card credit card bill addressed to Tina Knight in West Virginia. Knight never received that statement in the mail.\n\nII\n\nProbable Cause for Bowker's Arrest\n\n23\nBowker argues that the magistrate judge erroneously found that there was probable cause to issue a warrant for his arrest premised on an alleged violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C), which prohibits telephone harassment. He further argues that trial court committed the same error when it denied Bowker's motion to suppress evidence obtained through the arrest warrant. We reject Bowker's arguments for the reasons stated below.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n24\nThe Court considers the evidence that the warrant-issuing magistrate judge had before him only to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. See United States v. Jones, 159 F.3d 969, 973 (6th Cir.1998) (citing Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39,  103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983)). The Court defers to findings of probable cause made by a magistrate, and will not set aside such findings unless they were arbitrarily made. United States v. Brown, 147 F.3d 477, 484 (6th Cir.1998). When reviewing a district court's denial of a motion to suppress, the Court reviews the district court's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. Id.\n\nB. Analysis\n\n25\nAt the preliminary hearing, the government brought a one-count criminal complaint against Bowker for the crime of telephone harassment, in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C). That section provides for a fine, imprisonment, or both for anyone, who in interstate or foreign communications:\n\n26\nmakes a telephone call or utilizes a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or communication ensues, without disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communications.\n\n27\n47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 223. Incorporated into the criminal complaint was the affidavit of FBI Agent Deane Hassman, who alleged that Bowker had made numerous telephone calls to Tina Knight in which Bowker did not identify himself, including a conversation with Knight on June 12, 2001, and messages left on Knight's answering machine on August 17-19 and 25-26, 2001. Agent Hassman's affidavit also provided extensive background details on Bowker's campaign of harassment against Knight via emails, letters and telephone calls.\n\n28\nBowker concedes that the magistrate judge could have found probable cause on the elements of using the telephone with the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass. He argues, however, that the magistrate had no basis to find the element of failing to disclose identity during the telephone calls because Knight, the recipient of those calls, allegedly recognized his voice, making it unnecessary for him to state his name. See J.A. 581 (testimony of Agent Hassman: \"There came a point in time where Tina [Knight] began to recognize a certain voice on the phone, which she believed to be Eric [sic] Bowker.\"). Bowker points to the fact that during the June 12, 2001 telephone conversation with Knight, she referred to Bowker as \"Eric\" [sic].\n\n29\nBowker's argument is flawed in several respects. His argument does not address the numerous occasions when Bowker called Knight and no conversation ensued and no messages were left or her answering machine. The evidence before the magistrate showed that Bowker used a caller identification blocking feature (*67) to place these calls, thereby concealing his identity. Since the telephone harassment law prohibits calls made with the intent to harass or annoy \"whether or not conversation or communication ensues,\" there was probable cause to find that Bowker had concealed his identity in those instances. Knight's alleged ability to identify Bowker's voice was irrelevant.\n\n30\nBowker responds that his use of the *67 feature should be legally irrelevant, since it penalizes him for placing telephone calls to numbers with a caller identification service. He contends that criminal liability should not hinge on what telephone features a person pays for each month to the local phone company. Bowker, however, is not being penalized based on the telephone features to which his victim subscribed, but for using the *67 feature in conjunction with his intent to annoy or harass Knight. Had he lacked that intent, no criminal liability would have attached.\n\n31\nEven assuming that Knight was able to identify Bowker's voice, the magistrate judge properly found probable cause to believe that Bowker had not disclosed his identity during the June 12, 2001 conversation in which he mis-identified himself as \"Mike\" and in August, 2001, when he left messages on Knight's answering machine without providing any name at all. On its face, the telephone harassment statute makes it illegal to place a call, with the intent to annoy, abuse threaten or harass, whenever the caller fails to identify himself. Since Bowker concedes that the magistrate judge could have found probable cause that he had the requisite intent, it was Bowker's provision of a false name and/or his failure to identify himself \u2014 not an erroneous judicial determination about the victim's recognition of his voice \u2014 that led to the issuance of his arrest warrant.\n\n32\nBowker similarly argues that the district court, which supervised the trial proceedings, erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence derived from his arrest for telephone harassment. In addition to his argument that the evidence did not support a finding of probable cause to believe that Bowker had failed to disclose his identity (discussed above), Bowker argues that the district court erred in ruling that FBI agent Hassman did not intentionally mislead or omit crucial material facts in his affidavit supporting probable cause. Bowker argues that he showed, by a preponderance of the evidence, materially false representations and omissions by Agent Hassman, and that absent those misrepresentations, probable cause would not have been found.\n\n33\nTo prevail on a motion to suppress based on allegations of intentional misrepresentation by a law enforcement officer in the course of obtaining an arrest warrant, Bowker must establish (1) the allegation of perjury or reckless disregard \"by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence\" and (2) \"with the affidavit's false material set to one side, the affidavit's remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause, [such that] the search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search' suppressed.\" United States v. Graham, 275 F.3d 490, 505 (6th Cir.2001) (quoting Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978)). Bowker has not established that Agent Hassman perjured himself in his affidavit in support of the criminal complaint or at the suppression hearing. At most, he quibbles with Hassman's characterization of Bowker's letters and emails as sexual and threatening. Hassman's characterization, however, largely is a matter of opinion, and the content of Bowker's communications speak for themselves. Thus, there is no indication that the magistrate judge was misled in reaching its probable cause finding. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Bowker's motion to suppress evidence.\n\nIII\n\n34\nMotion to Dismiss Counts 1, 2 and 4 of the Indictment\n\n35\nBowker argues that the district court erred in failing to dismiss Counts 1 (interstate stalking), 2 (cyberstalking) and 4 (telephone harassment) of the indictment on the ground that the indictment inadequately alleged the elements of the offenses charged, and on the ground that the statutes that the indictment alleged he violated are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. We review the denial of a motion to dismiss de novo. United States v. Maney, 226 F.3d 660, 663 (6th Cir.2000). For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the district court.\n\nA. Sufficiency of the Indictment\n\n36\nUnder the Notice Clause of the Sixth Amendment, a criminal defendant has the right \"to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation\" against him. U.S. Const. amend. VI. In addition, the Indictment Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that a defendant be charged with only those charges brought before the grand jury. U.S. Const. amend. V. An indictment satisfies these constitutional requirements \"if it, first, contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge against which he must defend, and, second, enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.\" Maney, 226 F.3d at 663 (citing Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S. Ct. 2887,  41 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1974); Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 763-64, 82 S. Ct. 1038, 8 L. Ed. 2d 240 (1962); United States v. Sturman, 951 F.2d 1466, 1478-79 (6th Cir.1991)). \"To be legally sufficient, the indictment must assert facts which in law constitute an offense; and which, if proved, would establish prima facie the defendant's commission of that crime.\" Id. (quoting United States v. Superior Growers Supply, Inc., 982 F.2d 173, 177 (6th Cir.1992)).\n\n37\n\"An indictment is usually sufficient if it states the offense using the words of the statute itself, as long as the statute fully and unambiguously states all the elements of the offense.\" United States v. Landham, 251 F.3d 1072, 1079 (6th Cir.2001) (citing Hamling, 418 U.S. at 117, 94 S. Ct. 2887; United States v. Monus, 128 F.3d 376, 388 (1997)). The Supreme Court has cautioned, however, that while \"the language of the statute may be used in the general description of the offense, ....it must be accompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the specific offense, coming under the general description, with which he is charged.\" Hamling, 418 U.S. at 117-18, 94 S. Ct. 2887 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\" `Courts utilize a common sense construction in determining whether an indictment sufficiently informs a defendant of an offense.'\" Maney, 226 F.3d at 663 (quoting Allen v. United States, 867 F.2d 969, 971 (6th Cir.1989)).\n\n38\nCount1 (interstate stalking)1, Count 2 (cyberstalking)2 and Count 4 (telephone harassment)3 track the language of the relevant statutes. Count 1 alleges that, between July 10 and July 30, 2001, Bowker knowingly and intentionally traveled across the Ohio state line with the intent to injure, harass, and intimidate Tina Knight, and as a result of such travel placed Knight in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A(1). Count 2 alleges that between December 25, 2000 and August 18, 2001 Bowker, located in Ohio, knowingly and repeatedly used the internet to engage in a course of conduct that intentionally placed Knight, then located in West Virginia, in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A(2). Count 4 alleges that between June 12, 2001, and August 27, 2001, Bowker, located in Ohio, knowingly made telephone calls, whether or not conversation or communication ensued, without disclosing his identity and with the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten and harass Knight, in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C). Because the indictment stated all of the statutory elements of the offenses, and because the relevant statutes state the elements unambiguously, the district court properly denied Bowker's motion to dismiss Counts 1, 2 and 4 of the indictment. The indictment's reference to the specific dates and locations of the offenses, as well as the means used to carry them out (travel, internet, telephone), provided Bowker fair notice of the conduct with which he was being charged.\n\n39\nRelying on the Landham case, supra, Bowker argues that the indictment was defective because it does not charge him with making direct threats against Knight and therefore should have contained a statement of facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged indirect threats he made against her, such as an explanation of the parties' relationship. See Landham, 251 F.3d at 1080 (holding \"because the alleged threatening statement must be viewed from the objective perspective of the recipient, which frequently involves the context of the parties' relationship...., it is incumbent on the Government to make that context clear in such an indictment, unless the alleged threat is direct\").\n\n40\nLandham is distinguishable, however. There, the Court held that the indictment failed to sufficiently allege a kidnaping threat because the indictment was missing several elements of the offense, specifically, a communication containing a threat and a threat to kidnap. Id. at 1082. The indictment failed to acknowledge that the defendant had been in a custody battle with his ex-wife over their daughter and, therefore, the defendant's obscure statements like \"I'm going to get her\" were either unreasonably perceived to be kidnaping threats and, even if the alleged threat had been carried out, it would not have constituted a crime as a matter of substantive law. Id. at 1081-83. The Court further held that the indictment failed to sufficiently allege a threat of bodily harm, because the statement charged in the indictment referred to past conduct of the defendant, not present or future conduct, and, in any event, did not mention a threat to inflict bodily harm. Id. at 1082-83. Bowker's indictment, by contrast, did not contain similar deficiencies. All of the statutory elements of the prohibited conduct were properly alleged, including the intent to cause a reasonable fear of death or serious bodily harm. And unlike the parties involved in Landham, whose custody battle was highly relevant to the charged conduct, Bowker's relationship with Knight had no relevant bearing on the alleged illegality of his conduct. We therefore reject Bowker's challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment.\n\nB. Overbreadth Challenge\n\n41\nAccording to the Supreme Court, imprecise laws can be attacked on their face under two different doctrines \u2014 overbreadth and vagueness. City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 119 S. Ct. 1849, 144 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1999). The \"overbreadth doctrine is a limited exception to the traditional standing rule that a person to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied may not challenge that statute on the basis that it may conceivably be applied in an unconstitutional manner to others not before the court.\" Staley v. Jones, 239 F.3d 769, 784 (6th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). However, \"overbreadth scrutiny diminishes as the behavior regulated by the statute moves from pure speech toward harmful, unprotected conduct.\" Id. at 785. \"`[P]articularly where conduct and not merely speech is involved, we believe that the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.'\" Id. (quoting Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 615-16, 93 S. Ct. 2908,  37 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1973)).\n\n42\nBowker has provided absolutely no argument as to how 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A, which prohibits interstate stalking and cyberstalking, is facially overbroad, merely asserting that the statute \"reaches large amounts of protected speech and conduct\" and \"potentially targets political or religious speech.\" We fail to see how a law that prohibits interstate travel with the intent to kill, injure, harass or intimidate has a substantial sweep of constitutionally protected conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A(1). The same is true with respect to the prohibition of intentionally using the internet in a course of conduct that places a person in reasonable fear of death or seriously bodily injury. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A(2). It is difficult to imagine what constitutionally-protected political or religious speech would fall under these statutory prohibitions. Most, if not all, of these laws' legal applications are to conduct that is not protected by the First Amendment. Thus, Bowker has failed to demonstrate how 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A is substantially overbroad.\n\n43\nWe also reject Bowker's argument as to the purported overbreadth of the telephone harassment statute, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C). Bowker relies on the Supreme Court's decision in Coates v. City of Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611, 91 S. Ct. 1686, 29 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1971), which involved a city ordinance that made it a criminal offense for three or more persons to assemble on a sidewalk and to be \"annoying\" to passersby. Id. at 611,  91 S. Ct. 1686. The Court struck down the ordinance, reasoning that it was \"unconstitutionally broad because it authorizes the punishment of constitutionally protected conduct.\" Id. at 614, 91 S. Ct. 1686.\n\n44\nCoates is distinguishable. First, the focus of the telephone harassment statute is not simply annoying telephonic communications. It also prohibits abusive, threatening or harassing communications. Thus, the thrust of the statute is to prohibit communications intended to instill fear in the victim, not to provoke a discussion about political issues of the day. See United States v. Lampley, 573 F.2d 783, 787 (3d Cir.1978) (holding that in enacting the telephone harassment statute, \"Congress had a compelling interest in the protection of innocent individuals from fear, abuse or annoyance at the hands of persons who employ the telephone, not to communicate, but for other unjustifiable motives\") (citations omitted). Second, the telephone harassment statute operates in a distinctly different realm of communication than the ordinance in Coates, which governed the manner in which individuals could assemble and communicate in the open on public property. Persons who find sidewalk speech annoying usually are not being singled out by the speaker and, in any event, have the option of ignoring that speech by walking away or taking a different route. Because the sidewalk speaker is operating in the open, annoyed listeners have little reason to fear for their safety and can readily identify and confront the speaker if they so choose. Not so with individuals receiving unwelcome, anonymous telephone calls. Call recipients have to deal with much more inconvenience to avoid the speech (e.g., changing telephone numbers or using a call-screening service); these calls usually are targeted toward a particular victim and are received outside of a public forum (e.g., the home or the workplace); and, because the caller does not identify himself, the speech is more likely to instill fear in the listener and, at a minimum, makes it more difficult for the listener to confront the caller. Accordingly, the domain of prohibited speech is far more circumscribed, and the government's interest in protecting recipients of the speech is far more compelling, under the telephone harassment statute compared to the city ordinance at issue in Coates.\n\n45\nWe acknowledge that the telephone harassment statute, if interpreted to its semantic limits, may have unconstitutional applications. For example, if Bowker had been charged with placing anonymous telephone calls to a public official with the intent to annoy him or her about a political issue, the telephone harassment statute might have been unconstitutional as applied to him. See United States v. Popa, 187 F.3d 672, 677-78 (D.C.Cir.1999) (holding that telephone harassment statute was unconstitutional as applied to defendant who had placed seven calls to a U.S. Attorney to complain about his treatment by the police and the prosecutor's conduct of a case against him). But Bowker was not so charged. His calls were predominately, if not exclusively, for the purpose of invading his victim's privacy and communicating express and implied threats of bodily harm. This type of speech is not constitutionally protected. Landham, 251 F.3d at 1080. But the fact that application of the telephone harassment statute may be unconstitutional in certain instances does not warrant facial invalidation. See Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 760, 94 S. Ct. 2547, 41 L. Ed. 2d 439 (1974) (facial invalidation not appropriate when the remainder of the statute \"covers a whole range of easily identifiable and constitutionally proscribable conduct\"); Staley, 239 F.3d at 786-87 (holding that \"several examples of speech or expressive conduct that could conceivably be restricted under the statute\" did not render anti-stalking statute unconstitutional). Whatever overbreadth exists in the statute \"can be cured on a case-by-case basis.\" Staley, 239 F.3d at 787 (citing Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 615-16, 93 S. Ct. 2908). No cure is necessary in this case.\n\nC. Vagueness Challenge\n\n46\n\"[E]ven if an enactment does not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, it may be impermissibly vague because it fails to establish standards for the police and public that are sufficient to guard against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty interests.\" Morales, 527 U.S. at 52,  119 S. Ct. 1849 (citing Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903 (1983)). Vagueness may invalidate a criminal statute if it either (1)fails \"to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits\" or (2) authorizes or encourages \"arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\" Id. at 56, 119 S. Ct. 1849 (citing Kolender, 461 U.S. at 357, 103 S. Ct. 1855). \"It is established that a law fails to meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause if it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits....\" Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399, 402-03, 86 S. Ct. 518, 15 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1966).\n\n47\nThe stalking and telephone harassment statutes charged in Bowker's indictment provide sufficient notice of their respective prohibitions because citizens need not guess what terms such as \"harass\" and \"intimidate\" mean. This Court's decision in Staley v. Jones, supra, is instructive. That case involved a habeas corpus review of a conviction for stalking under a Michigan law that defines stalking as \"a willful course of conduct involving repeated or continuing harassment of another individual that would cause a reasonable person to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested and that actually causes the victim to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, threatened, harassed, or molested.\" Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.411i(e). Michigan law defines \"harassment\" as \"conduct directed toward a victim that includes, but is not limited to, repeated or continuing unconsented contact that would cause a reasonable individual to suffer emotional distress and that actually causes the victim to suffer emotional distress.\" Id. \u00a7 750.411i(d). Expressly excluded from the definition of \"harassment\" is \"constitutionally protected activity or conduct that serves a legitimate purpose.\" Id. This Court rejected the petitioner's vagueness challenge to the Michigan statute, reasoning as follows:\n\n48\nA person of reasonable intelligence would not need to guess at the meaning of the stalking statutes, nor would his interpretation of the statutory language differ with regard to the statutes' application, in part because the definitions of crucial words and phrases that are provided in the statutes are clear and would be understandable to a reasonable person reading the statute.... Also, the meaning of the words used to describe the conduct can be ascertained fairly by reference to judicial decisions, common law, dictionaries, and the words themselves because they possess a common and generally accepted meaning. We therefore conclude that the statutes are not void for vagueness on the basis of inadequate notice.\n\n49\nStaley, 239 F.3d at 791-92.\n\n50\nThe Michigan prohibition against willful harassment that causes a reasonable person to feel fear is almost indistinguishable from the federal anti-stalking statute, 18U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A(1), which prohibits intentional harassment that causes a reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury. In fact, the federal statute arguably is less vague because it circumscribes the type of fear a victim must feel, namely a fear of death or serious bodily injury, whereas the Michigan law does not.\n\n51\nBowker attempts to distinguish the Michigan statute by pointing to the fact that Michigan law defines the word \"harassment,\" whereas federal law does not. The harassment definition under Michigan law, however, contains nothing not already reflected in the federal statute's general prohibition. The Michigan definition of harassment requires conduct directed toward a victim, but this requirement is implicitly reflected in the federal statute's requirement that a perpetrator intend to harass a victim. Michigan's harassment definition also requires that the conduct cause a reasonable individual to suffer emotional distress, but the federal statute requires conduct that causes a fear of death or serious bodily injury. There simply is no principled basis to distinguish the language of the federal statute from the Michigan statute which this Court upheld in Staley.\n\n52\nWe also reject Bowker's argument that the stalking and telephone harassment statutes' failure to define words like \"harass\" and \"intimidate\" render them void for vagueness. As noted by the Court in Staley, the meaning of these words \"can be ascertained fairly by reference to judicial decisions, common law, dictionaries, and the words themselves because they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.\" Staley, 239 F.3d at 791-92. Indeed, the Michigan anti-stalking statute, which the Staley Court upheld, does not appear to define the word \"intimidate,\" a word that Bowker claims is too vague in the federal law. For this reason as well, we reject Bowker's vagueness challenge to the federal law.\n\n53\nBowker's reliance on Church of the Am. Knights of the Ku Klux Klan v. City of Erie, 99 F. Supp. 2d 583 (W.D.Pa.2000), also is misplaced. There, the court held that a city ordinance that restricted the wearing of a mask \"with the intent to intimidate, threaten, abuse or harass any other person\" was unconstitutionally vague. Id. at 591 (quotation marks and statutory citation omitted). The court found that each of these terms, given their ordinary meaning, could encompass forms of expression that are constitutionally protected. Id. Not only might it prohibit certain types of advocacy, such as advocating the return to segregation, but it also might prohibit the simple act of wearing a mask. Id. The court also found that the ordinance did not provide the public with adequate notice of what type of conduct was prohibited. The ordinance, however, is not comparable to the federal anti-stalking statute. The federal anti-stalking statute, which prohibits harassment or intimidation that causes a reasonable fear of death or serious bodily harm, imposes a far more concrete harm requirement than the ordinance at issue in Ku Klux Klan, which did not require that the harassment or intimidation result in any particular type of reaction in the audience. See id. at 592 (holding that ordinance was unconstitutionally vague: \"To some extent, the speaker's liability is potentially defined by the reaction or sensibilities of the listener; what is `intimidating or threatening' to one person may not be to another. And, although the provision has a scienter requirement, it is reasonable to expect that the requisite intent could be inferred from circumstantial factors, which may include the effect that particular speech has on the speaker's audience.\").\n\n54\nWe further reject Bowker's argument that the federal stalking and telephone harassment statutes authorize or encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. Although the statutes provide no guidelines on terms like harass and intimidate, the meanings of these terms \"can be ascertained fairly by reference to judicial decisions, common law, dictionaries, and the words themselves because they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.\" Staley, 239 F.3d at 791-92. Thus, Bowker has not demonstrated that these statutes fail to provide \"sufficiently specific limits on the enforcement discretion of the police to meet constitutional standards for definiteness and clarity.\" Morales, 527 U.S. at 64, 119 S. Ct. 1849 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n55\nOnly Bowker's vagueness challenge to part of the telephone harassment statute, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C), merits further discussion. As noted above, that statute prohibits using a telephone, without disclosing identity, with the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the number called. Bowker argues that the term \"annoy\" is unconstitutionally vague, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Coates, supra. In rejecting the city ordinance which made it a criminal offense for three or more persons to assemble on a sidewalk and to be \"annoying\" to passersby, the Court reasoned:\n\n56\nIn our opinion this ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it subjects the exercise of the right of assembly to an unascertainable standard, and unconstitutionally broad because it authorizes the punishment of constitutionally protected conduct. Conduct that annoys some people does not annoy others. Thus, the ordinance is vague, not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all.\n\n57\nId. at 614, 91 S. Ct. 1686. The Court further held that the ordinance violated the First Amendment right to freedom of assembly because the \"First and Fourteenth Amendments do not permit a State to make criminal the exercise of the right of assembly simply because its exercise may be `annoying' to some people.\" Id. at 615, 91 S. Ct. 1686.\n\n58\nWe agree that the word \"annoy,\" standing alone and devoid of context and definition, may pose vagueness concerns. But that is not the case with the telephone harassment statute. The statute reads \"annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass.\" 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C). The Supreme Court has observed that \"[c]anons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings, unless the context dictates otherwise.\" Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979) (emphasis added). Here, the statutory language must be read in the context of Congressional intent to protect innocent individuals from fear, abuse or annoyance at the hands of persons who employ the telephone, not to communicate, but for other unjustifiable motives. Lampley, 573 F.2d at 787. This context suggests that the words annoy, abuse, threaten or harass should be read together to be given similar meanings. Any vagueness associated with the word \"annoy\" is mitigated by the fact that the meanings of \"threaten\" and \"harass\" can easily be ascertained and have generally accepted meanings. Staley, 239 F.3d at 791-92,\n\n59\nEven assuming, arguendo, that Bowker's vagueness argument theoretically has merit, he cannot rely on it to invalidate the indictment or his conviction for telephone harassment, because the statute clearly applies to the conduct he allegedly committed. The Supreme Court held in Parker v. Levy supra, 417 U.S. at 756, 94 S. Ct. 2547:\n\n60\n... [O]ne who has received fair warning of the criminality of his own conduct from the statute in question is [not] entitled to attack it because the language would not give similar fair warning with respect to other conduct which might be within its broad and literal ambit. One to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\n\n61\nHere, Bowker engaged in an anonymous campaign of threatening and harassing conduct directed toward Knight through use of the telephone (as well as the mails and the computer) that clearly fell within the statute's prohibition. This type of conduct lies at the core of what the telephone harassment statute was designed to prohibit. Lampley, 573 F.2d at 787. FBI Agent Hassman specifically warned Bowker that he might be arrested if he persisted in his course of telephone harassment, but Bowker ignored that warning. Moreover, the fact that Bowker engaged in this campaign with an intent to threaten or harass mitigates any concern that he may have been punished for merely having a communication over the telephone. As the Third Circuit held in rejecting a vagueness challenge to the very same statutory language:\n\n62\nThe section's specific intent requirement renders unconvincing appellant's second claim that [the predecessor to \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C) is] unconstitutionally vague. It has long been true that (t)he Court, indeed, has recognized that the requirement of a specific intent to do a prohibited act may avoid those consequences to the accused which may otherwise render a vague or indefinite statute invalid.... (W)here the punishment imposed is only for an act knowingly done with the purpose of doing that which the statute prohibits, the accused cannot be said to suffer from lack of warning or knowledge that the act which he does is a violation of law. Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 101-02, 65 S. Ct. 1031, 1035, 89 L. Ed. 1495 (1945). The appellant cannot claim confusion about the conduct proscribed where, as here, the statute precisely specifies that the actor must intend to perform acts of harassment in order to be culpable.\n\n63\nLampley, 573 F.2d at 787. Thus, Bowker vagueness challenge fails. The district court did not err in denying his motion to dismiss Counts 1, 2 and 4 of the indictment.\n\nIV\n\n64\nMotion to Sever Count 3 from the Indictment\n\n65\nThe district court denied Bowker's motion to sever Count3 of the indictment (mail theft) from Counts 1 (interstate stalking), 2 (cyberstalking), and 4 (telephone harassment). Bowker had argued that joinder of these counts would prejudice his rights under the Fifth Amendment and Rules 8 and 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Specifically, he argued that the mail theft count should not be admissible to support the other three counts for stalking and telephone harassment on the ground that the crimes did not possess the same or similar characteristics and that there was no nexus between the mail theft count and the other alleged crimes. He further argued that he wished to testify concerning the stalking and telephone harassment counts, which require the government to prove intent, but not the mail theft count, and that joinder precluded him from exercising his Fifth Amendment right to testify only as to the stalking and telephone harassment counts. Last, he argued that the jury's exposure to evidence pertaining to the stalking and telephone harassment counts would prejudice them in deciding the mail theft count. Bowker renews these arguments on appeal.\n\n66\nA motion for relief from the prejudicial joinder of counts must be renewed at the close of the evidence. United States v. Hudson, 53 F.3d 744, 747 (6th Cir.1995). When the defendant fails to renew the motion, this Court can reverse a conviction only upon a showing of plain error. United States v. Anderson, 89 F.3d 1306, 1312 (6th Cir.1996). Bowker failed to renew his motion to sever Count 3 of the indictment from Counts 1, 2 and 4 at the close of the evidence. Accordingly, he must demonstrate plain error by the district court.\n\n67\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8 provides, in relevant part:\n\n68\n(a) Joinder of Offenses. The indictment or information may charge a defendant in separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses charged \u2014 whether felonies or misdemeanors or both \u2014 are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.\n\n69\nFed.R.Crim.P. 8(a). Rule 14 provides, in relevant part:\n\n70\n(a) Relief. If the joinder of offenses or defendants in an indictment, an information, or a consolidation for trial appears to prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts, sever the defendants' trials, or provide any other relief that justice requires.\n\n71\nFed.R.Crim.P. 14(a). The record clearly shows that all of the counts in Bowker's indictment were of the same or similar character and that the allegations thereunder were an integral part of Bowker's common scheme to harass and threaten Knight. This scheme involved a 14-month campaign of sending emails and regular mail and placing telephone calls to her workplace in Youngstown; sending mail to her parent's home; placing telephone calls to Knight's unpublished home number in West Virginia; placing telephone calls to Knight's West Virginia workplace; sending mail to Knight's West Virginia home; and stealing Knight's mail from her West Virginia home. Thus, all of the counts properly were joined pursuant to Rule 8, and the district court did not plainly err under Rule 14 by refusing to sever the mail theft count.\n\n72\nBowker also has not demonstrated that the district court committed plain error when it rejected his argument that severance was required in order to permit him to testify as to the mail theft count, but to avoid testimony as to the stalking and telephone harassment counts. The Tenth Circuit confronted a similar argument in United States v. Martin, 18 F.3d 1515, 1518-19 (10th Cir.1994), stating:\n\n73\nMartin contends that the denial of his severance motion \"forced [him] to testify at trial and convict himself as to the drug count in an attempt to win an acquittal of the gun count.\".... Martin further contends that inasmuch as he \"had both important testimony to give concerning one count and a strong need to refrain from testifying on the other,\" .... the district court's refusal to sever the counts deprived him of a fair trial....[N]o need for a severance exists until the defendant makes a convincing showing that he has both important testimony to give concerning one count and a strong need to refrain from testifying on the other. Applying these standards to our case, we hold that Martin failed to demonstrate a convincing need for a severance.\n\n74\nSeveral other circuits have applied the same or similar standards. E.g., United States. v. Alosa, 14 F.3d 693, 695 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that defendant did not deserve severance because he failed to make a convincing showing that he had both important testimony to give concerning one count and a strong need to refrain from testifying on the other); United States v. Gorecki, 813 F.2d 40, 43 (3d Cir.1987) (holding that defendant's bare allegation that the joinder of counts prevented his testimony on one count, without a specific showing as to what that testimony may have been, failed to meet the stringent requirements for severance under Rule 14); United States v. Ballis, 28 F.3d 1399, 1408 (5th Cir.1994) (affirming denial of severance because defendant did not point out this alleged dilemma in testifying about some counts but not others with sufficient specificity for the trial court to have abused its discretion in denying the motion); United States v. Alexander, 135 F.3d 470, 477 (7th Cir.1998) (noting that there may be cases in which a defendant can convincingly show that he has important testimony to give on one count but a strong need to remain silent on another, and in that circumstance, severance may be required; affirming denial of severance because defendant failed to provide specific examples of the exculpatory testimony that he would testify about).\n\n75\nIt is clear that Bowker failed to make a \"convincing showing\" that he had important testimony concerning the interstate stalking and telephone harassment counts, as well as a \"strong need\" to refrain from testifying on the mail theft count. Indeed, his motion to sever provided absolutely no indication as to what his testimony would be on the stalking and harassment counts, stating only that his testimony was \"anticipated to be crucial\" because these crimes have a specific intent requirement. In addition, Bowker showed absolutely no need to avoid testifying on the mail theft count, merely arguing that his testimony on this count was \"not needed\" because mail theft lacks a specific intent requirement. Such non-specific assertions of prejudice are insufficient to warrant severance under Rule 14. For these reasons, the district court did not commit plain error in refusing to sever the counts of the indictment.\n\nV\n\nRight to Self-Representation\n\n76\nBowker argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court denied his constitutional right to represent himself. We review such a denial for an abuse of discretion. Robards v. Rees, 789 F.2d 379, 384 (6th Cir.1986).\n\n77\nOn January 22, 2002, Bowker, then represented by counsel, filed on his own initiative a hand-written motion \"for release of appointed attorney.\" In that motion, Bowker stated, \"Now Comes Defendant, being first advised of his rights to an attorney, and does now knowingly, willingly, and intelligently waive his rights, to court-appointed counsel.\" The district court purported to deny that motion via a hand-written minute order on January 28, 2002, stating that \"Defendant's pro se motion for new counsel is denied.\" The court did not refer to the fact that Bowker's motion did not seek new counsel, but to waive his right to counsel. Bowker, however, soon had a change of heart about representing himself because on March 26, 2002, Bowker's attorney moved to withdraw as counsel due to \"the fractured lawyer-client relationship.\" In an attached statement signed by Bowker, Bowker requested that his appointed lawyer withdraw from the case \"and that a new lawyer be appointed to represent\" him. The court granted the motion on April 10, 2002 and appointed a new federal public defender for Bowker on April 22, 2002.\n\n78\nThe sixth and fourteenth amendments guarantee state criminal defendants the right of self-representation at trial. See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975). Since it is more likely than not that a defendant would fare better with the assistance of counsel, id. at 835, 95 S. Ct. 2525, he will be permitted to represent himself only when he \"knowingly and intelligently\" relinquishes his right to counsel. Id. Such a knowing waiver must be made by a \"clear and unequivocal\" assertion of the right to self-representation. Id.\"Once there is a clear assertion of that right, the court must conduct a hearing to ensure that the defendant is fully aware of the dangers and disadvantages of proceeding without counsel.\" Raulerson v. Wainwright, 732 F.2d 803, 808 (11th Cir.1984) (citation omitted).\n\n79\nWe hold that the district court erred in denying Bowker's January 22, 2002 motion to represent himself which was accompanied by a clear and unequivocal assertion of the right to self-representation. At a minimum, the court should have conducted some inquiry into the bases for Bowker's motion. It is not apparent from the record that the district court did anything other than misconstrue the motion as a motion for appointment of new counsel and then deny the motion. Nevertheless, the district court's error was rendered harmless by Bowker's change of heart about self-representation over two months prior to trial. As noted above, after being denied the right to represent himself, Bowker explicitly joined his then-attorney's motion to withdraw from the case and to have new counsel appointed for him. Thus, Bowker's last indication to the district court on the matter was that he did not wish to represent himself. Cf. id. at 809 (\"Even if Raulerson's letter of July 18, 1980 constituted a clear and unequivocal demand to represent himself, his agreement to proceed with the assistance of an attorney waived that original request....\"). Accordingly, the district court's erroneous disposition of the January 22, 2002 motion for self-representation was rendered harmless error by Bowker's subsequent waiver of his right to self-representation. Bowker, therefore, is not entitled to a new trial.\n\nVI\n\nMotion to Return Seized Property\n\n80\nOn February 5, 2002, Bowker filed a pro se motion for return of seized property and items, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. He sought an order from the court directing the government to return all items and tangible objects which were not going to be used as evidence in his case. As of May 29, 2002, the district court had not yet ruled on the motion, so Bowker filed a \"request for ruling on motion for return of property.\" On June 4, 2002, the district court denied Bowker's request for a ruling on the motion for return of property. No reasons were provided by the court for the denial, and the district court never held a hearing on, nor has it ever ruled on, the underlying motion for return of property.\n\nRule 41 provides, in relevant part:\n\n81\n(g) Motion to Return Property. A person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure of property or by the deprivation of property may move for the property's return. The motion must be filed in the district where the property was seized. The court must receive evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion. If it grants the motion, the court must return the property to the movant, but may impose reasonable conditions to protect access to the property and its use in later proceedings.\n\n82\nFed.R.Crim.P. 41(g). In United States v. Hess, 982 F.2d 181 (6th Cir.1992), this Court observed that \"`[a] district court has both the jurisdiction and the duty to return the contested property once the government's need for it has ended.'\" Id. at 187 (internal quotation marks omitted); quoting United States v. Martinson, 809 F.2d 1364, 1370 (9th Cir.1987) (citing United States v. Wilson, 540 F.2d 1100, 1103-04 (D.C.Cir.1976)). There, the district court had failed to address the legal or factual issues raised in a party's motion for return of seized records. The Court found it significant that no hearing was held regarding who was entitled to possession of the documents, and the district court had failed to consider the merits of the moving party's arguments. The Court also was troubled because there were no findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding which party was entitled to retain the records. Accordingly, the Court held that the district court did not discharge its duty under Rule 41(g) to hear and decide the issues, reasoning that Rule 41(g) \"clearly contemplates a hearing `on any issue of fact necessary to the decision of the motion.'\" Id. at 186.\n\n83\nHess is directly on point. The district court below simply ignored Bowker's motion to return records, and when Bowker filed a motion to have the court rule on that motion, the court denied the motion, without ever reaching the merits of the underlying motion. The court held no hearing, took no evidence, and gave no indication that it ever has considered the merits of Bowker's motion. Accordingly, on remand, the district court shall hold a hearing on Bowker's motion for return of records, take evidence on any factual issues necessary to resolve that motion, and promptly rule on that motion.\n\nVII\n\n84\nMotion for a Judgment of Acquittal as to Counts 1, 2 and 4\n\n85\nBowker challenges the district court's failure to grant his motion for a judgment of acquittal on Counts 1, 2 and 4 of the indictment, pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n86\n\"In reviewing a district court's denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on a claim of insufficient evidence, `the relevant question is whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.'\" United States v. Lloyd, 10 F.3d 1197, 1210 (6th Cir.1993) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781,  61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)). \"If the evidence, however, is such that a rational fact finder must conclude that a reasonable doubt is raised, this court is obligated to reverse a denial of an acquittal motion.\" Id. (quoting United States v. Collon, 426 F.2d 939, 942 (6th Cir.1970)). The district court's findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and circumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to sustain a conviction. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Home Ins. Co., 278 F.3d 621, 625 (6th Cir.2002); United States v. Peters, 15 F.3d 540, 544 (6th Cir.1994).\n\nB. Interstate Stalking Count\n\n87\nCount 1 of the indictment charges Bowker with interstate stalking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A(1). The government was required to prove:\n\n88\n(1) that the defendant traveled in interstate or foreign commerce;\n\n89\n(2) with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate another person; and\n\n90\n(3) in the course of, or as a result of, such travel places that person in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, that person, a member of the immediate family of that person, or the spouse or intimate partner of that person.\n\n91\nBowker argues that the government did not prove, pursuant to the interstate stalking count, that the \"result of\" Bowker's travel from Ohio to West Virginia in July, 2001, was to put Knight in reasonable fear of her life or bodily injury, because Knight did not learn of Bowker's travels until August 2001, after he had completed his travel. This argument is specious. Knight learned of Bowker's travel to West Virginia because he sent her numerous photographs informing her that he had been in the state the preceding month. Accompanying the photographs was the statement, \"Take the photos out to read the backs of them. Send me an E-mail address. It keeps me long distance, you know what I mean.\" The clear implication of this statement was that Bowker would continue to communicate with Knight, unless she provided him with her email address. The jury was entitled to infer that this statement, combined with the photographs of Bowker at various locations in West Virginia, was intended to intimidate Knight by showing her that Bowker had traveled to her state and would do so in the future. The statute did not require the government to show that Bowker actually intended to harass or intimidate Knight during his travels, only that the result of the travel was a reasonable apprehension of fear in the victim. Since Knight testified that she was afraid that Bowker might rape her, and her fear seemed reasonable, the government proved all of the elements of the interstate stalking count.\n\nC. Cyberstalking Count\n\n92\nCount 2 of the indictment charges Bowker with cyberstalking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A(2). The government was required to prove:\n\n93\n(1) Bowker intentionally used the mail or any facility of interstate or foreign commerce;\n\n94\n(2) Bowker engaged in a course of conduct with the intent to place Knight in reasonable fear of death of, or serious bodily injury to, herself, her spouse or intimate partner, or a member of her immediate family; and\n\n95\n(3) Bowker's course of conduct actually placed Knight in reasonable fear of death of, or serious bodily injury to, herself.\n\n96\nThe evidence shows that Bowker's intended to instill in Knight a fear of death or serious bodily harm through use of the mails and other facilities of interstate commerce, required elements of the cyberstalking count. During a June 12, 2001 telephone conversation with Knight, Bowker told her: You don't know where I'm at. I might be in your house in Dunbar[, West Virginia]; you don't know that.... I know all of your neighbors..... And I have access to all that information, just like anybody else does who knows where to find it. I have an enormous amount of things about you that I'm not going to disclose unless I have to. I'm not going to tell anybody about it except if you lie to me. I might not say anything to you at the time, but that might come back, you know..... I know the names of all your relatives and where they live..... I know your brothers' wives['] names, their ages, their Social Security numbers and their birth dates .... and their property values..... Maybe I live on 20th street in Dunbar..... Maybe I watch you with binoculars all the time and maybe I don't.\n\n97\n(J.A. 985-88, 1000.) A July 16, 2001 letter that Bowker sent to Knight at the television station had both sexual and threatening connotations. It read, in part:\n\n98\nNo. 1. You do not hang up on me.\n\n99\nNo. 2. You do not hang up on me, ever.\n\n100\nNo. 3. If and when I call CBS 13 asking about a news story that you reported on, you do not hang up on me. You must at least do the bare minimum and answer my news related questions.\n\n101\nI know what you value most in life, your bullshit fake ass 1997 Pontiac Grand Am, which is about top on your list as well as two other things. As far as the Grand Am is concerned, say good-bye to it. I am going to file a mechanics lien on it immediately and later seek civil forfeiture.\n\n102\nAll that you ... would have to do is be polite, be nice, and answer my news-related questions, just like the rest of the reporters, except your buddy April Kaull. I'm going to file a lien on her vehicle too. You are both fuck-ups, assholes and seriously emotionally and mentally unbalanced.....\n\n103\nAlso, WOWK will hire just about anyone. Or at least a pretty girl reporter, as long as she does her hair and makeup well.....\n\n104\nThat vehicle is exemplary of you, pretty on the outside and very worthless inside. You have female genitals and that is about it. You are a very slander to the word woman. Oh, yeah, you dress like one but so do transvestites. I think I would rather spend the evening with a pretty transvestite than with you.....\n\n105\nAnyhow, I also think that it is time for your neighbors to get to know you better and I will be making attempts to inform them about how the prima donna from Ohio things [sic] she can eat from the top and throw her garbage on the sidewalk of West Virginia and Dunbar.....\n\n106\nI also noticed that you already had the job and residence in West Virginia when you had your Ohio License plates renewed, for one year anyhow.....\n\n107\nSo bye-bye, fuck you, you are an asshole and a sociopath and an embarrassment to mothers everywhere, sir. In parenthesis: (I wasn't bringing up the mental case thing again since it is genetic.)\n\n108\nYes, sir. Adios, Eric [sic]. Smooch. Smooch.\n\n109\n(J.A. 1011-15.) In August 2001, Bowker left a series of messages on Knight's answering machine asking that Knight or Knight's friend call him back, which did not occur. These messages contained statements that Knight reasonably could perceive to be threats to her personal safety. Excerpts include the following statements: I don't even know why I'm nice to you ever at all, you and your fucked-up friend should not even be working in the media. You know you gotta mother-fucking realize there's like 50 percent men in this country and you better mother-fucking learn that you're going to have to deal with us sometime.....\n\n110\nWell, it looks like nobody is going to answer me if Tina Knight is okay, so I'm gonna take the 1:00 a.m. bus out of Columbus, Ohio and come down there and see for myself. Okay, I'll be there about 6:00 a.m. Bye.\n\n111\n(J.A. 1226-27.) Since Knight testified that these intentionally intimidating, threatening and harassing interstate communications made her afraid to leave the house everyday and that Bowker might try to rape her, the government proved all of the elements of the cyberstalking count.\n\nD.Telephone Harassment Count\n\n112\nCount 4 of the indictment charged Bowker with telephone harassment, in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C). The government had to prove that:\n\n113\n(1) Bowker made interstate telephone calls to Knight;\n\n114\n(2) Bowker did not disclose his identity in the telephone calls; and\n\n115\n(3) in the telephone calls, whether or not conversation or communication ensued, Bowker intended to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass Knight or any person at the called number.\n\n116\nBowker's primary argument against his conviction for telephone harassment is that Knight allegedly was aware of Bowker's identity when she received his calls. The statute, however, does not preclude criminal responsibility merely because the recipient may suspect, or have a very good idea of, the caller's identity. Rather, assuming that Bowker called Knight with the requisite intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass, the only issue is whether Bowker disclosed his identity in those calls. It is clear that in all of the at-issue telephone calls, Bowker never affirmatively identified himself as Erik Bowker. In fact, he denied being Bowker during a conversation with Knight on June 12, 2001, and instead stated that his name was Mike. Thus, a straightforward application of the telephone harassment statute shows that the jury reasonably found the non-disclosure element to be satisfied.\n\nVIII\n\n117\nMotion for a New Trial on Counts 1, 2 and 4\n\n118\nThe denial of a defendant's motion for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 is reviewed for abuse of discretion. United States v. Ashworth, 836 F.2d 260, 266 (6th Cir.1988). The Court is \"limited to examining the evidence produced at trial to determine whether the district court's determination that the evidence does not `preponderate heavily against the verdict' is a clear and manifest abuse of discretion.\" Id. (citation omitted). As discussed in the preceding section, there was ample evidence to support Bowker's convictions on Counts 1, 2 and 4 of the indictment. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion to find that the evidence did not preponderate heavily against the verdict.\n\nIX\n\n119\nUpward Departure for Extreme Psychological Harm to the Victim\n\n120\nAfter Bowker's convictions, he was sentenced pursuant to the 2000 edition of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual (\"Guidelines\"). Based upon a final offense level of 19, and a criminal history corresponding to Category V, Bowker's Guidelines' range was between 57 and 71 months. The government moved for a three level upward departure in his sentence based on extreme psychological injury to the victim, Tina Knight. The basis for the motion was, in part, Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.3. The district court granted the motion for upward departure. Because Bowker argues that the sentence imposed by the district court was outside the applicable guideline range and was based on a factor that is not justified by the facts of the case, this Court reviews the district court's determination under a de novo standard. 18U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e).\n\nSection 5K2.3 of the Guidelines provides:\n\n121\n\u00a7 5K2.3. EXTREME PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURY (POLICY STATEMENT)\n\n122\nIf a victim or victims suffered psychological injury much more serious than that normally resulting from commission of the offense, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range. The extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the severity of the psychological injury and the extent to which the injury was intended or knowingly risked.\n\n123\nNormally, psychological injury would be sufficiently severe to warrant application of this adjustment only when there is a substantial impairment of the intellectual, psychological, emotional, or behavioral functioning of a victim, when the impairment is likely to be of an extended or continuous duration, and when the impairment manifests itself by physical or psychological symptoms or by changes in behavior patterns. The court should consider the extent to which such harm was likely, given the nature of the defendant's conduct.\n\n124\nGuidelines \u00a7 5K2.3 (Nov. 1, 2000). With regard to the crime of stalking, Guidelines \u00a7 2A6.2 instructs that \"an upward departure may be warranted if the defendant stalked the victim on many occasions over a prolonged period of time.\" Guidelines \u00a7 2A6.2, Application Note 5.\n\n125\nThe record shows that Bowker stalked Knight on many occasions and over a prolonged period of time. See Guidelines \u00a7 2A6.2, Application Note 5. FBI Special Agent James McNamara, an expert on stalking crimes, testified at the sentencing hearing as to the extreme nature of Bowker's conduct. McNamara pointed to the facts that the harassment occurred over a period of years and in two different states; involved numerous, multi-media contacts (letters, telephone calls, email and interstate travel); and involved contacts with Knight's friends and family members. Further, Bowker's campaign of harassment substantially impaired Knight's \"behavioral functioning\" as manifested by \"changes in [her] behavior patterns.\" Guidelines \u00a7 5K2.3. Knight was so distressed that she was left with profound feelings of paranoia and felt compelled to change banks and unlist her phone number, and have her bills sent to a different address. She also purchased a gun, routinely uses a security escort, and, most unfortunately, decided to forgo her on-air news career.\n\n126\nKnight's Victim Impact Statement movingly captures the extreme psychological distress that Bowker's stalking activities inflicted on her:\n\n127\nThe two years that I was stalked changed my family and me. First of all since the stalking began because of my job as a television news reporter it has turned me off to a future in that career.....I don't want to be anyone's favorite newscaster because I fear it will turn into another situation like the one I had.....I am also concerned about major purchases in the future, like a home, and how he may be able to track me down.....Even writing this I am careful not to mention anything about my personal life for fear he will read this and it will give him another means by which to contact me.....I am concerned about the rest of my life.....I am not confident this will stop. That is my biggest fear. When he gets out of jail this could start all over again so I truly can never relax. It's just putting off my ultimate fear that someday, no matter what I do, he will show up at my front door with intent to harm me. By now I've given him reason to really hate me in his mind. I testified against him in court and helped put him in jail. I hope he isn't out for revenge.4\n\n128\nWe hold that the above-described facts amply justified the district court's upward departure determination. Cf. United States v. Otto, 64 F.3d 367, 371 (8th Cir.1995) (affirming upward departure where stalking victim lived in constant fear for herself and for her children and was always on the lookout for the defendant; could not eat or sleep; lost weight; required counseling; and feared the defendant's ultimate release); United States v. Miller, 993 F.2d 16, 21 (2d Cir.1993) (affirming upward departure after the defendant had engaged in a three year campaign of harassment; noting that the victim had been afraid to answer the telephone or open her mail for three years; was afraid to remain in the New York area; and believed that the years of harassment had hastened her husband's demise).\n\nX\n\nExpert Testimony on Stalking\n\n129\nAs noted in the preceding section, the government called an expert on stalking crimes, FBI Special Agent James McNamara, to testify at Bowker's sentencing hearing. Bowker argues that the district court's decision to hear the testimony of Agent McNamara was erroneous and that the court's decision should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. The Federal Rules of Evidence, however, are by their own terms expressly inapplicable to sentencing hearings. Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3). According to the federal statute that governs the use of information in sentencing, \"[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661. The Supreme Court has explained that this statute \"codifies the longstanding principle that sentencing courts have broad discretion to consider various kinds of information.\" United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 151, 117 S. Ct. 633, 136 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1997). Accordingly, this Court reviews the district court's admission of Agent McNamara's testimony for an abuse of discretion in determining that the testimony had \"sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\" Guidelines \u00a7 6A1.3(a).\n\n130\nAgent McNamara has been with the FBI for 15 years and is assigned to the FBI as a behavioral analyst. His duties include looking at the behavior of criminals, conducting research with convicted offenders and disseminating the results of that research, and working on active criminal cases as a law enforcement consultant. McNamara has been trained in a variety of disciplines, including criminal justice, psychology, forensic science, anthropology and psychology. Based on his review of transcripts and other materials pertaining to Bowker's case, McNamara testified that Bowker had engaged in multimedia attempts to contact Knight, including letters, email, telephonic contacts, and the sending of gifts. McNamara opined that the sending of gifts in a stalking case is \"significantly important in the areas of increased dangerousness.\" He further testified that Bowker escalated his activity, from contacts through the mail, to telephonic and electronic mail contact, to traveling interstate to pursue Knight. McNamara also indicated that Bowker's past history of violence, including domestic abuse, was a predictor of future dangerousness or violence. As a consequence of these findings, McNamara concluded that Bowker was a more dangerous type of stalker.\n\n131\nWe hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Agent McNamara's testimony at the sentencing hearing. His testimony was relevant to the court's application of Guidelines \u00a7 2A6.2, which determines how the base offense level is to be calculated for the crime of stalking. Guideline \u00a7 2A6.2 provides for a two-level increase in the base offense level for a pattern of activity involving stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim. McNamara's testimony directly addressed this issue. Agent McNamara's testimony also was relevant to determining whether an upward departure was warranted for extreme psychological injury to the victim. See Guidelines \u00a7 2A6.2, Application Note 5 (instructing that the severity of the stalking may warrant an upward departure). Therefore, the district court did not err in entertaining Agent McNamara's expert testimony at sentencing.\n\nXI\n\nBowker's Right of Allocution\n\n132\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) provides that, before imposing a sentence, the court must \"address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.\" Bowker argues that the district court denied him this right of allocution. We apply a de novo standard of review. United States v. Wolfe, 71 F.3d 611, 614 (6th Cir.1995).\n\n133\nAfter Bowker's attorney cross-examined Agent McNamara, the FBI expert on stalking, the district court asked Bowker directly, \"Is there anything that you have to say to this Court before it imposes sentence?\" Bowker responded that he would like to read a lengthy statement, and the court told Bowker to proceed. Bowker began by challenging his prior criminal history. The court then went through each crime that formed the foundation for the assignment of a Criminal History Category V. Bowker then asked to address some things that occurred during his trial, and the court told him to proceed. Bowker gave a lengthy justification for his conduct underlying his convictions, complained about not being able to testify as to his intent, and pointed out that he has severe physical disabilities and mental problems. Bowker next complained about the performance of his attorney. Bowker then asked the court to have his mother testify, which the court permitted. The only request the district court appeared to deny Bowker was his desire to read a 15-page statement into the record. Based on the totality of the circumstances, we see no merit to Bowker's argument that he was denied the right of allocution. Cf. United States v. Kellogg, 955 F.2d 1244, 1250 (9th Cir.1992) (\"Although the defendant has a right of allocution at sentencing, that right is not unlimited.\").\n\nXII\n\nConclusion\n\n134\nFor all the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Defendant Bowker's convictions and sentence. This case shall be REMANDED for the district court to conduct a hearing and to rule on Bowker's motion to return seized property.\n\nNotes:\n\n*\nThe Honorable Richard Mills, United States District Judge for the Central District of Illinois, sitting by designation\n\n1\nCount 1 of the indictment charges Bowker with interstate stalking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A(1). That section penalizes whoever:\n\ntravels in interstate or foreign commerce or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or enters or leaves Indian country, with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate another person, and in the course of, or as a result of, such travel places that person in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, that person, a member of the immediate family (as defined in section 115) of that person, or the spouse or intimate partner of that person.\n\n2\nCount 2 of the indictment charges Bowker with cyberstalking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A(2). That section penalizes whoever: with the intent \u2014\n\n(A) to kill or injure a person in another State or tribal jurisdiction or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States; or\n\n(B) to place a person in another State or tribal jurisdiction, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to \u2014\n\n(i) that person;\n\n(ii) a member of the immediate family (as defined in section 115) of that person; or\n\n(iii) a spouse or intimate partner of that person,\n\nuses the mail or any facility of interstate or foreign commerce to engage in a course of conduct that places that person in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, any of the persons described in clauses (i) through (iii).\n\n3\nCount 4 of the indictment charges Bowker with telephone harassment, in violation of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(a)(1)(C). That section penalizes whoever:\n\n(1) in interstate or foreign communications \u2014\n\n(C) makes a telephone call or utilizes a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or communication ensues, without disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communications.\n\n4\nBowker made

On appeal he challenges the denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized from his home, arguing that the search warrant was not based on probable cause because it was issued on the basis of illegally obtained evidence. Watzman also challenges the denial of his motion to require the government to prove his \"intent to traffic\" in connection with the nine counts of receiving child pornography. He contends the statute is unconstitutionally vague absent this element. We affirm.\n\nI. Background\n\n2\nIn early 2003 a federal investigation based in New Jersey uncovered a company called \"Regpay\" located in Minsk, Belarus, that operated numerous fee-based websites containing pornographic images of children. By purchasing memberships to these sites, federal agents were able to view the websites' content and confirm that they advertised and included child pornography. In June 2003 investigators seized the company's customer database, which consisted of the names, mailing and e-mail addresses, and credit card numbers of the customers who bought access to any of its websites, as well as the dates of purchase and the names of the websites. One such customer was Marc Watzman, a Chicago resident who had paid for access to eight of the company's web-sites, including sites named \"www.lolitacastle.com\" and \"www.undergroundlolitastudio.com.\"\n\n3\nIn April 2003 Watzman began transacting with \"Pedoshop,\" a \"child pornography production organization\" based in Russia. Through e-mail, Pedoshop offered Watzman access to its \"very big child porno collection,\" and shortly thereafter Watzman placed an order. Between April and October he ordered 89 video clips that contained child pornography. Watzman paid $9700 to Pedoshop for the videos.\n\n4\nBased on information Watzman had supplied in registering for the websites, investigators tracked him to a post office box in Chicago and from there obtained his home address and driver's license records. Through visual surveillance, investigators confirmed that Watzman, a 37-year-old pediatrician, lived in a garden apartment at 1454 North Wieland Street in Chicago. On October 22, 2003, officers from the Chicago Police Department, cooperating with federal agents, went to Watzman's apartment and told him they were following up on a burglary he had reported two years earlier. Watzman allowed the officers to enter his apartment, where they noticed a desktop computer connected to an active cable modem, as well as a laptop computer.\n\n5\nOn October 24, 2003, federal agents applied for a warrant to search Watzman's apartment and seize evidence of his receipt and possession of child pornography, including credit card records; documents confirming his ownership of the post office box used to obtain membership to pornographic websites; computer hardware and software; and any sexually explicit images of children, including videos, photographs, and digital images. The warrant application was supported by a 23-page affidavit by Ronald Wolflick, a special agent from the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and supervisor of the Cyber-Crimes Investigations Group in Chicago. Among the information included in the affidavit were four paragraphs in which Wolflick described the contact between Watzman and Chicago police officers two days earlier. The magistrate judge issued the warrant, and a search was conducted the following day. Among the items seized were Watzman's desktop and laptop computers, which held thousands of digital images depicting child pornography, and a number of DVDs with similar content, some encrypted and requiring extensive decoding.\n\n6\nWatzman was ultimately charged with one count of possessing child pornography, nine counts of receiving it, and one count of money laundering. Among various pretrial motions he filed was a motion to quash the search warrant and suppress all evidence seized during its execution on October 25. He principally argued that the ruse engaged in by the Chicago police officers to gain consent to enter his home on October 22 invalidated the search warrant. Watzman contended the ruse was unlawful and any information gleaned during the officers' visit\u2014in particular, the knowledge that he had two computers inside his home\u2014was tainted. Absent this information, he argued, there was no reason to believe contraband would be found in the apartment and thus no basis for the warrant. The district court held that the October 22 consent search was invalid, but declined to suppress the evidence obtained on October 25 pursuant to the warrant. The court reasoned that \"the remaining averments in the affidavit of Agent Wolflick provide probable cause for the issuance of the warrant.\"\n\n7\nWatzman also filed a motion to require the government to prove, as an element of receiving child pornography, that he intended to traffic in child pornography. Otherwise, he argued, no meaningful distinction could be made between \"receiving\" and \"possessing\" child pornography and therefore the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The district court denied the motion. Watzman then entered into a plea agreement with the government, pleading guilty to one count of possessing and nine counts of receiving child pornography and reserving his right to challenge the district court's rulings on his suppression motion and his motion challenging the receipt statute. The district court imposed concurrent sentences of five years' imprisonment on each count, the minimum penalty under the statute and below the advisory guidelines range of 78 to 97 months.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n8\nOn appeal Watzman first argues that the affidavit in support of the application for a search warrant did not establish probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime would be found in his apartment. We review de novo the district court's determination that the warrant was supported by probable cause. United States v. Sidwell, 440 F.3d 865, 868 (7th Cir.2006). Because this is a case where the validity of the warrant rests solely on the strength of an affidavit, probable cause exists if the affidavit \"sets forth sufficient evidence to induce a reasonably prudent person to believe that a search will uncover evidence of a crime.\" United States v. Peck, 317 F.3d 754, 756 (7th Cir.2003); see United States v. Anderson, 450 F.3d 294, 302-03 (7th Cir.2006). The inquiry is \"practical, not technical.\" Anderson, 450 F.3d at 302; see Sidwell, 440 F.3d at 868.\n\n9\nThe government has not challenged the district court's conclusion that any information gleaned during the phony \"burglary follow-up\" on October 22 is tainted. So we must determine whether the affidavit sworn on October 24, when purged of these facts, still contained sufficient information to establish probable cause. Watzman argues that it did not, primarily because the officers' observations on October 22 were the only evidence that his apartment had a working computer and Internet connection, and without that information the affidavit \"failed to establish that any illegal activity could be found\" in his home. The district court improperly assumed, he argues, that \"pornography necessarily is viewed in the privacy of one's own home.\" Watzman submits that it is \"equally likely\" that one might download child pornography in \"innumerable places, such as offices, public and private libraries, universities and airports.\"\n\n10\nWatzman's argument is meritless. First, probable cause is not certainty; it requires \"only a probability or substantial chance that evidence may be found.\" Sidwell, 440 F.3d at 869. Thus, Watzman's assertion that alternative inferences might have been drawn about where child pornography might be stored is unavailing. Moreover, a finding of probable cause \"does not require direct evidence linking a crime to a particular place.\" Anderson, 450 F.3d at 303. Reasonable inferences are permitted. Id.; United States v. Angle, 234 F.3d 326, 335 (7th Cir.2000). In his affidavit Agent Wolflick explained in great detail his experience with consumers of child pornography and specifically averred that these individuals tend to hoard collections at home. The district court's reliance on these expert representations is not an \"assumption\"; the court was entitled to rely on Agent Wolflick's expertise to conclude that there was a fair probability that child pornography would be found in Watzman's home. See United States v. Hall, 142 F.3d 988, 995 (7th Cir.1998) (citing \"expert information\" in affidavit that \"pornographers tend to maintain their collections of material for long periods, usually at home\"); United States v. Lacy, 119 F.3d 742, 746 (9th Cir.1997) (holding that affidavit provided \"ample reason\" to believe items sought were in defendant's apartment, where affiant stated that \"collectors and distributors of child pornography value their sexually explicit materials highly, `rarely if ever' dispose of such material, and store it `for long periods' in a secure place, typically in their homes\").\n\n11\nWatzman further contends that the information in the affidavit was stale. The most recent listed date on which Watzman downloaded child pornography was in July 2003, and the warrant was not sought until October 2003. Accordingly, Watzman asserts, there was no evidence that he still possessed any child pornography, other than Agent Wolflick's \"uncorroborated assertion\" that individuals who view child pornography tend to make collections and maintain them for years.\n\n12\nWatzman's argument is unconvincing. The age of information contained in an affidavit is only one factor a judge considers, and it is less important when the criminal activity in question is apparently continuous. See United States v. Spry, 190 F.3d 829, 836 (7th Cir.1999). Moreover, we previously have concluded that \"[i]nformation a year old is not necessarily stale as a matter of law, especially where child pornography is concerned.\" United States v. Newsom, 402 F.3d 780, 783 (7th Cir.2005) (emphasis added). In Newsom, the affidavit before the judge did not state that child pornographers tend to hold on to their stashes; rather, \"it was clear from the context\" that law enforcement officials believed that the defendant still possessed such materials. Id. Here, Agent Wolflick specifically averred that individuals who view child pornography typically \"maintain their collections for many years\" and \"keep and collect items containing child pornography over long periods of time.\" Again, despite Watzman's insistence to the contrary, the district court was entitled to rely on the experience of an expert in the field of enforcing child pornography laws when evaluating the sufficiency of the affidavit. See United States v. Gourde, 440 F.3d 1065, 1071-72 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc) (four-month lapse immaterial where affidavit explained that consumers of child pornography become \"pack rats\" due to the difficulty of obtaining materials); United States v. Chrobak, 289 F.3d 1043, 1046 (8th Cir.2002) (rejecting argument that information about images transmitted ninety-one days before search was stale on basis of affiant's statement that \"child pornographers generally retain their pornography for extended periods\"). In this case, where only three months passed, and Agent Wolflick attested that those who possess child pornography save their materials, Watzman's argument that the information in the affidavit was stale is meritless.\n\n13\nWatzman also challenges the district court's rejection of his argument that the statute criminalizing the receipt of child pornography is unconstitutionally vague \"because it does not define `receipt' or distinguish it from the offense of mere possession.\" Watzman contends that \"without any evidence of trafficking and distributing,\" \"receipt\" cannot be distinguished from \"possession\" and, therefore, the statute \"enables arbitrary and discriminatory prosecution.\" A criminal statute is unconstitutionally vague if it does not define the criminal offense with enough specificity to provide people of ordinary intelligence with notice of what is prohibited or if it fails to provide explicit standards to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. See Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903 (1983); United States v. Lim, 444 F.3d 910, 915 (7th Cir.2006). The statute in question makes it a crime for a person to \"knowingly receive[ ] or distribute[ ] ... child pornography that has been mailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2). In contrast, the subsection of \u00a7 2252A concerning simple possession targets any individual who \"knowingly possesses any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer disk, or any other material that contains an image of child pornography that has been mailed, or shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer.\" \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B).\n\n14\nWatzman has not established that \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) fails either the \"notice\" or the \"arbitrary enforcement\" tests for unconstitutional vagueness. We have previously rejected the argument that \"the distinction between receipt and possession of child pornography is meaningless, because anyone in possession of child pornography must have received it at some time.\" United States v. Myers, 355 F.3d 1040, 1042-43 (7th Cir.2004). We noted in Myers that to be convicted of receiving, the defendant must have known the material he was receiving depicted minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. See id. at 1042 (citing United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 78, 115 S. Ct. 464, 130 L. Ed. 2d 372 (1994)). Accordingly, a person who receives child pornography by accident (for example, if he sought adult pornography but was sent child pornography instead) is not guilty of knowingly receiving it, though he is guilty of possessing it if he retains it. Myers, 355 F.3d at 1042; see United States v. Malik, 385 F.3d 758, 759 (7th Cir.2004) (positing that a person who created an image or found it in trash could \"possess\" child pornography without ever receiving it). We stated that receiving materials that have been shipped in interstate commerce is conduct more closely linked to the market for child pornography and so \"possession and receipt are not the same conduct and threaten distinct harms.\" Myers, 355 F.3d at 1042-43; see United States v. Barevich, 445 F.3d 956, 959 (7th Cir.2006) (explaining that \"[t]ransporting and receiving child pornography increases market demand\"). This is so without an element of \"intent to traffic.\"\n\n15\nAlthough Myers did not address a vagueness challenge, the opinion squarely rejected the premise of Watzman's constitutional argument\u2014that receipt and possession are substantially the same offense. By distinguishing receipt from possession, the two subsections of the statute are sufficiently clear about what conduct each prohibits. In addition, it cannot be said that the receiving child pornography statute relies on the discretion of those who enforce it to define its terms. We have recognized that all receivers are possessors but not all possessors are receivers, and so the matter of which crime to charge is not simply a product of the prosecutor's whims, as Watzman suggests. Watzman's conduct violated multiple statutes, but this is unremarkable, see Malik, 385 F.3d at 760, and has no bearing on whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague.\n\n16\nFinally, Watzman contends that receiving child pornography exclusively for his own private use is not the type of conduct at which the statute is aimed. We have previously rejected the argument that there is some sort of \"personal use\" exception to this statute. See United States v. Ellison, 113 F.3d 77, 81 (7th Cir.1997) (\"[E]ven the receipt of the prohibited materials for personal use, without more, keeps producers and distributors of this filth in business.\").\n\n17\nAFFIRMED.", "annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 63}, {"start": 64, "end": 104}, {"start": 105, "end": 126}, {"start": 127, "end": 160}, {"start": 161, "end": 185}, {"start": 186, "end": 208}, {"start": 210, "end": 223}, {"start": 225, "end": 311}, {"start": 313, "end": 325}, {"start": 327, "end": 375}, {"start": 377, "end": 400}, {"start": 402, "end": 423}, {"start": 425, "end": 537}, {"start": 539, "end": 638}, {"start": 640, "end": 688}, {"start": 690, "end": 711}, {"start": 713, "end": 714}, {"start": 715, "end": 914}, {"start": 915, "end": 1137}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1312}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1385}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1396}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1400}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1411}, {"start": 1413, "end": 1414}, {"start": 1415, "end": 1621}, {"start": 1622, "end": 1783}, {"start": 1784, "end": 2057}, {"start": 2058, "end": 2257}, {"start": 2259, "end": 2260}, {"start": 2261, "end": 2380}, {"start": 2381, "end": 2518}, {"start": 2519, "end": 2604}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2651}, {"start": 2653, "end": 2654}, {"start": 2655, "end": 2858}, {"start": 2859, "end": 3022}, {"start": 3023, "end": 3234}, {"start": 3235, "end": 3391}, {"start": 3393, "end": 3394}, {"start": 3395, "end": 3823}, {"start": 3824, "end": 4043}, {"start": 4044, "end": 4214}, {"start": 4215, "end": 4301}, {"start": 4302, "end": 4529}, {"start": 4531, "end": 4532}, {"start": 4533, "end": 4675}, {"start": 4676, "end": 4825}, {"start": 4826, "end": 4983}, {"start": 4984, "end": 5162}, {"start": 5163, "end": 5307}, {"start": 5308, "end": 5465}, {"start": 5466, "end": 5606}, {"start": 5608, "end": 5609}, {"start": 5610, "end": 5769}, {"start": 5770, "end": 5942}, {"start": 5943, "end": 5980}, {"start": 5981, "end": 6274}, {"start": 6275, "end": 6463}, {"start": 6465, "end": 6468}, {"start": 6469, "end": 6479}, {"start": 6481, "end": 6482}, {"start": 6483, "end": 6685}, {"start": 6686, "end": 6788}, {"start": 6789, "end": 6848}, {"start": 6849, "end": 7120}, {"start": 7121, "end": 7245}, {"start": 7246, "end": 7288}, {"start": 7289, "end": 7345}, {"start": 7347, "end": 7348}, {"start": 7349, "end": 7507}, {"start": 7508, "end": 7667}, {"start": 7668, "end": 7967}, {"start": 7968, "end": 8092}, {"start": 8093, "end": 8277}, {"start": 8279, "end": 8281}, {"start": 8282, "end": 8314}, {"start": 8315, "end": 8437}, {"start": 8438, "end": 8463}, {"start": 8464, "end": 8600}, {"start": 8601, "end": 8712}, {"start": 8713, "end": 8739}, {"start": 8740, "end": 8776}, {"start": 8777, "end": 8839}, {"start": 8840, "end": 9031}, {"start": 9032, "end": 9281}, {"start": 9282, "end": 9892}, {"start": 9894, "end": 9896}, {"start": 9897, "end": 9970}, {"start": 9971, "end": 10113}, {"start": 10114, "end": 10365}, {"start": 10367, "end": 10369}, {"start": 10370, "end": 10405}, {"start": 10406, "end": 10582}, {"start": 10583, "end": 10643}, {"start": 10644, "end": 10808}, {"start": 10809, "end": 10884}, {"start": 10885, "end": 11130}, {"start": 11131, "end": 11359}, {"start": 11360, "end": 11582}, {"start": 11583, "end": 12096}, {"start": 12097, "end": 12314}, {"start": 12316, "end": 12318}, {"start": 12319, "end": 12575}, {"start": 12576, "end": 12785}, {"start": 12786, "end": 13074}, {"start": 13075, "end": 13215}, {"start": 13216, "end": 13453}, {"start": 13454, "end": 13478}, {"start": 13479, "end": 13844}, {"start": 13845, "end": 13862}, {"start": 13864, "end": 13866}, {"start": 13867, "end": 14008}, {"start": 14009, "end": 14226}, {"start": 14227, "end": 14289}, {"start": 14290, "end": 14456}, {"start": 14457, "end": 14581}, {"start": 14582, "end": 14827}, {"start": 14828, "end": 15041}, {"start": 15042, "end": 15275}, {"start": 15276, "end": 15459}, {"start": 15460, "end": 15513}, {"start": 15515, "end": 15517}, {"start": 15518, "end": 15714}, {"start": 15715, "end": 15850}, {"start": 15851, "end": 15996}, {"start": 15997, "end": 16202}, {"start": 16203, "end": 16373}, {"start": 16375, "end": 16377}, {"start": 16378, "end": 16530}, {"start": 16531, "end": 16640}, {"start": 16641, "end": 16845}, {"start": 16847, "end": 16849}, {"start": 16850, "end": 16859}]}, "59e7f6fc74b84c4d877aa808": {"text": "United States v.

Thomas Furniss, Furniss & Quinn, Hartford, CT, for defendant.\n\n \nRULING ON MOTION TO DISMISS\n\nTHOMPSON, District Judge.\n\nDefendant Aleksey Vladimirovich Ivanov (\"Ivanov\") has been indicted, in a superseding indictment, on charges of conspiracy, computer fraud and related activity, extortion and possession of unauthorized access devices. Ivanov has moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Ivanov argues that because it is alleged that he was physically located in Russia when the offenses were committed, he can not be charged with violations of United States law. For the reasons set forth below, the defendant's motion is being denied.\n\n \nI. Background\n\nOnline Information Bureau, Inc. (\"OIB\"), the alleged victim in this case, is a Connecticut corporation based in Vernon, Connecticut. It is an \"e-commerce\" business which assists retail and Internet merchants by, among other things, hosting their websites and processing their credit card data and other financial transactions. In this capacity, OIB acts as a financial transaction \"clearinghouse\", by aggregating and assisting in the debiting or crediting of funds against each account for thousands of retail and Internet purchasers and vendors. In doing so, OIB collects and maintains customer credit card information, merchant account numbers, and related financial data from credit card companies and other financial institutions.\n\n*369 The government alleges that Ivanov \"hacked\" into OIB's computer system and obtained the key passwords to control OIB's entire network. The government contends that in late January and early February 2000, OIB received from Ivanov a series of unsolicited e-mails indicating that the defendant had obtained the \"root\" passwords for certain computer systems operated by OIB. A \"root\" password grants its user access to and control over an entire computer system, including the ability to manipulate, extract, and delete any and all data. Such passwords are generally reserved for use by the system administrator only.\n\nThe government claims that Ivanov then threatened OIB with the destruction of its computer systems (including its merchant account database) and demanded approximately $10,000 for his assistance in making those systems secure. It claims, for example, that on February 3, 2000, after his initial solicitations had been rebuffed, Ivanov sent the following e-mail to an employee of OIB:\n\n \n[name redacted], now imagine please Somebody hack you network (and not notify you about this), he download Atomic software with more than 300 merchants, transfer money, and after this did `rm-rf/' and after this you company be ruined. I don't want this, and because this i notify you about possible hack in you network, if you want you can hire me and im allways be check security in you network. What you think about this?[1]\nThe government contends that Ivanov's extortionate communications originated from an e-mail account at Lightrealm.com, an Internet Service Provider based in Kirkland, Washington. It contends that while he was in Russia, Ivanov gained access to the Lightrealm computer network and that he used that system to communicate with OIB, also while he was in Russia. Thus, each e-mail sent by Ivanov was allegedly transmitted from a Lightrealm.com computer in Kirkland, Washington through the Internet to an OIB computer in Vernon, Connecticut, where the e-mail was opened by an OIB employee.[2]\n\nThe parties agree that the defendant was physically located in Russia (or one of the other former Soviet Bloc countries) when, it is alleged, he committed the offenses set forth in the superseding indictment.\n\n*370 The superseding indictment comprises eight counts. Count One charges that beginning in or about December 1999, or earlier, the defendant and others conspired to commit the substantive offenses charged in Counts Two through Eight of the indictment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Count Two charges that the defendant, knowingly and with intent to defraud, accessed protected computers owned by OIB and by means of this conduct furthered a fraud and obtained something of value, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 1030(a) (4) and 1030(c) (3) (A). Count Three charges that the defendant intentionally accessed protected computers owned by OIB and thereby obtained information, which conduct involved interstate and foreign communications and was engaged in for purposes of financial gain and in furtherance of a criminal act, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 1030(a) (2) (C) and 1030(c) (2) (B). Counts Four and Five do not pertain to this defendant.\n\nCount Six charges that the defendant transmitted in interstate and foreign commerce communications containing a threat to cause damage to protected computers owned by OIB, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1030(a) (7) and 1030(c) (3) (A). Count Seven charges that the defendant obstructed, delayed and affected commerce, and attempted to obstruct, delay and affect commerce, by means of extortion by attempting to obtain property from OIB with OIB's consent, inducing such consent by means of threats to damage OIB and its business unless OIB paid the defendant money and hired the defendant as a security consultant, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). Count Eight charges that the defendant, knowingly and with intent to defraud, possessed unauthorized access devices, which conduct affected interstate and foreign commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1029(a) (3).\n\n \nII. Discussion\n\nThe defendant and the government agree that when Ivanov allegedly engaged in the conduct charged in the superseding indictment, he was physically present in Russia and using a computer there at all relevant times. Ivanov contends that for this reason, charging him under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030, and under the access device statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029, would in each case require extraterritorial application of that law and such application is impermissible. The court concludes that it has jurisdiction, first, because the intended and actual detrimental effects of Ivanov's actions in Russia occurred within the United States, and second, because each of the statutes under which Ivanov was charged with a substantive offense was intended by Congress to apply extraterritorially.\n\n \nA. The Intended and Actual Detrimental Effects of the Charged Offenses Occurred Within the United States\n\nAs noted by the court in United States v. Muench, 694 F.2d 28 (2d Cir. 1982), \"[t]he intent to cause effects within the United States ... makes it reasonable to apply to persons outside United States territory a statute which is not expressly extraterritorial in scope.\" Id. at 33. \"It has long been a commonplace of criminal liability that a person may be charged in the place where the evil results, though he is beyond the jurisdiction when he starts the train of events of which that evil is the fruit.\" United States v. Steinberg, 62 F.2d 77, 78 (2d Cir.1932). \"[T]he Government may punish a defendant in the same manner as if [he] were present in the jurisdiction when the detrimental effects occurred.\" Marc Rich & Co., A.G. v. United States, 707 F.2d 663, 666 (2d Cir.1983).\n\n*371 The Supreme Court has quoted with approval the following language from Moore's International Law Digest:\n\n \nThe principle that a man, who outside of a country willfully puts in motion a force to take effect in it, is answerable at the place where the evil is done, is recognized in the criminal jurisprudence of all countries. And the methods which modern invention has furnished for the performance of criminal acts in that manner has made this principle one of constantly growing importance and of increasing frequency of application.\nFord v. United States, 273 U.S. 593, 623, 47 S. Ct. 531, 71 L. Ed. 793 (1927). Moreover, the court noted in Rich that:\n\n \n[I]t is certain that the courts of many countries, even of countries which have given their criminal legislation a strictly territorial character, interpret criminal law in the sense that offences, the authors of which at the moment of commission are in the territory of another State, are nevertheless to be regarded as having been committed in the national territory, if one of the constituent elements of the offence, and more especially its effects, have taken place there. The S.S. Lotus, 1927 P.C.I.J., ser. A, No. 10, at 23, reprinted in 2 Hudson, World Court Reports, 23, 38 (1935).\nRich, 707 F.2d at 666.\n\nHere, all of the intended and actual detrimental effects of the substantive offenses Ivanov is charged with in the indictment occurred within the United States. In Counts Two and Three, the defendant is charged with accessing OIB's computers. Those computers were located in Vernon, Connecticut. The fact that the computers were accessed by means of a complex process initiated and controlled from a remote location does not alter the fact that the accessing of the computers, i.e. part of the detrimental effect prohibited by the statute, occurred at the place where the computers were physically located, namely OIB's place of business in Vernon, Connecticut.\n\nCount Two charges further that Ivanov obtained something of value when he accessed OIB's computers, that \"something of value\" being the data obtained from OIB's computers. In order for Ivanov to violate \u00a7 1030(a) (4), it was necessary that he do more than merely access OIB's computers and view the data. See United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1078 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[M]erely viewing information cannot be deemed the same as obtaining something of value for purposes of this statute.\" ... \"[T]his section should apply to those who steal information through unauthorized access ....\"). The indictment charges that Ivanov did more than merely gain unauthorized access and view the data. Ivanov allegedly obtained root access to the OIB computers located in Vernon, Connecticut. Once Ivanov had root access to the computers, he was able to control the data, e.g., credit card numbers and merchant account numbers, stored in the OIB computers; Ivanov could copy, sell, transfer, alter, or destroy that data. That data is intangible property of OIB. See Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 25, 108 S. Ct. 316, 98 L. Ed. 2d 275 (1987) (noting that the \"intangible nature [of confidential business information] does not make it any less `property' protected by the mail and wire fraud statutes.\"). \"In determining where, in the case of intangibles, possession resides, the measure of control exercised is the deciding factor.\" New York Credit Men's Ass'n v. Mfrs. Disc. Corp., 147 F.2d 885, 887 (2d Cir.1945).\n\nAt the point Ivanov gained root access to OIB's computers, he had complete control over that data, and consequently, *372 had possession of it. That data was in OIB's computers. Since Ivanov possessed that data while it was in OIB's computers in Vernon, Connecticut, the court concludes that he obtained it, for purposes of \u00a7 1030(a) (4), in Vernon, Connecticut. The fact that Ivanov is charged with obtaining OIB's valuable data by means of a complex process initiated and controlled from a remote location, and that he subsequently moved that data to a computer located in Russia, does not alter the fact that at the point when Ivanov first possessed that data, it was on OIB's computers in Vernon, Connecticut.\n\nCount Three charges further that when he accessed OIB's computers, Ivanov obtained information from protected computers. The analysis as to the location at which Ivanov obtained the information referenced in this count is the same as the analysis as to the location at which he obtained the \"something of value\" referenced in Count Two. Thus, as to both Counts Two and Three, it is charged that the balance of the detrimental effect prohibited by the pertinent statute, i.e., Ivanov's obtaining something of value or obtaining information, also occurred within the United States.\n\nCount Six charges that Ivanov transmitted a threat to cause damage to protected computers. The detrimental effect prohibited by \u00a7 1030(a) (7), namely the receipt by an individual or entity of a threat to cause damage to a protected computer, occurred in Vernon, Connecticut because that is where OIB was located, where it received the threat, and where the protected computers were located. The analysis is the same as to Count Seven, the charge under the Hobbs Act.\n\nCount Eight charges that Ivanov knowingly and with intent to defraud possessed over ten thousand unauthorized access devices, i.e., credit card numbers and merchant account numbers. For the reasons discussed above, although it is charged that Ivanov later transferred this intangible property to Russia, he first possessed it while it was on OIB's computers in Vernon, Connecticut. Had he not possessed it here, he would not have been able to transfer it to his computer in Russia. Thus, the detrimental effect prohibited by the statute occurred within the United States.\n\nFinally, Count One charges that Ivanov and others conspired to commit each of the substantive offenses charged in the indictment. The Second Circuit has stated that \"the jurisdictional element should be viewed for purposes of the conspiracy count exactly as we view it for purposes of the substantive offense ....\" United States v. Blackmon, 839 F.2d 900, 910 (2d Cir.1988) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). See also United States v. Kim, 246 F.3d 186, 191, n. 2 (2d Cir.2001) (noting that jurisdiction over a conspiracy charge depends upon jurisdiction over the underlying substantive charge). Federal jurisdiction over a conspiracy charge \"is established by proof that the accused planned to commit a substantive offense which, if attainable, would have violated a federal statute, and that at least one overt act has been committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" United States v. Giordano, 693 F.2d 245, 249 (2d Cir.1982). Here, Ivanov is charged with planning to commit substantive offenses in violation of federal statutes, and it is charged that at least one overt act was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. As discussed above, the court has jurisdiction over the underlying substantive charges. Therefore, the court has jurisdiction over the conspiracy charge, at a minimum, to the extent it relates to Counts Two, Three, Six, Seven or Eight.\n\n*373 Accordingly, the court concludes that it has subject matter jurisdiction over each of the charges against Ivanov, whether or not the statutes under which the substantive offenses are charged are intended by Congress to apply extraterritorially, because the intended and actual detrimental effects of the substantive offenses Ivanov is charged with in the indictment occurred within the United States.\n\n \nB. Intended Extraterritorial Application\n\nThe defendant's motion should also be denied because, as to each of the statutes under which the defendant has been indicted for a substantive offense, there is clear evidence that the statute was intended by Congress to apply extraterritorially. This fact is evidenced by both the plain language and the legislative history of each of these statutes.\n\nThere is a presumption that Congress intends its acts to apply only within the United States, and not extraterritorially. However, this \"presumption against extraterritoriality\" may be overcome by showing \"clear evidence of congressional intent to apply a statute beyond our borders ....\" U.S. v. Gatlin, 216 F.3d 207, 211 (2d Cir.2000). \"Congress has the authority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial boundaries of the United States. Whether Congress has in fact exercised that authority in [a particular case] is a matter of statutory construction.\" Equal Employment Opportunity Comm. v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1991) (internal citations omitted) (\"ArAmCo\").\n\nThe defendant is charged with substantive offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029, and with conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.\n\n \n1. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951: The Hobbs Act\n\nThe Hobbs Act provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n \nWhoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (West 2000).\n\nThe Supreme Court has stated that the Hobbs Act \"speaks in broad language, manifesting a purpose to use all the constitutional power Congress has to punish interference with interstate commerce by extortion, robbery or physical violence.\" Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 215, 80 S. Ct. 270, 4 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1960). The Court has not had occasion to decide whether the \"broad language\" of the Hobbs Act expresses a congressional intent to apply the statute extraterritorially. However, the Third Circuit, relying in part on Stirone, concluded that:\n\n \n[E]ven if none of the [defendants'] overt acts had occurred in this country ... Congress could give the district court jurisdiction under the commerce clause so long as [the defendants'] activities affected [the victim's] commercial ventures in interstate commerce within the United States. See Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 215, 80 S. Ct. 270, 272, 4 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1960) (Hobbs Act utilizes all of Congress's commerce clause power and reaches even a minimal interference with commerce) ....\"\nUnited States v. Inigo, 925 F.2d 641, 648 (3d Cir.1991).\n\n*374 Based on the foregoing, this court concludes that the Hobbs Act encompasses not only all extortionate interference with interstate commerce by means of conduct occurring within the United States, but also all such conduct which, although it occurs outside the United States, affects commerce within the borders of the United States. Therefore, it is immaterial whether Ivanov's alleged conduct can be said to have taken place entirely outside the United States, because that conduct clearly constituted \"interference with interstate commerce by extortion\", Stirone, 361 U.S. at 215, 80 S. Ct. 270, in violation of the Hobbs Act. Consequently, the court has jurisdiction over this charge against him.\n\n \n2. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030: The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\n\nThe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\") was amended in 1996 by Pub.L. No. 104-294, 110 Stat. 3491, 3508. The 1996 amendments made several changes that are relevant to the issue of extraterritoriality, including a change in the definition of \"protected computer\" so that it included any computer \"which is used in interstate or foreign commerce or communication.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(e) (2) (B) (emphasis added). The 1996 amendments also added subsections (a) (2) (C) and (a) (7), which explicitly address \"interstate or foreign commerce\", and subsection (e) (9), which added to the definition of \"government entity\" the clause \"any foreign country, and any state, province, municipality or other political subdivision of a foreign country\".[3]\n\nThe plain language of the statute, as amended, is clear. Congress intended the CFAA to apply to computers used \"in interstate or foreign commerce or communication.\" The defendant argues that this language is ambiguous. The court disagrees. The Supreme Court has often stated that \"a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.\" Regions Hosp. v. Shalala, 522 U.S. 448, 467, 118 S. Ct. 909, 139 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1998) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). In order for the word \"foreign\" to have meaning, and not be superfluous, it must mean something other than \"interstate\". In other words, \"foreign\" in this context must mean international. Thus, Congress has clearly manifested its intent to apply \u00a7 1030 to computers used either in interstate or in foreign commerce.\n\nThe legislative history of the CFAA supports this reading of the plain language of the statute. The Senate Judiciary Committee issued a report explaining its reasons for adopting the 1996 amendments. S.Rep. No. 357, 104th Congr., 2d Sess. (1996). In that report, the Committee specifically noted its concern that the statute as it existed prior to the 1996 amendments did not cover \"computers used in foreign communications or commerce, despite the fact that hackers are often foreign-based.\" Id. at 4. The Committee cited two specific cases in which foreign-based hackers had infiltrated computer systems in the United States, as examples of the kind of situation the amendments were intended to address:\n\n \nFor example, the 1994 intrusion into the Rome Laboratory at Grifess Air Force Base in New York, was perpetrated by a 16-year-old hacker in the United Kingdom. More recently, in March 1996, the Justice Department tracked down a young Argentinean man who had broken into Harvard University's computers from Buenos Aires and used those computers as a staging ground to hack into *375 many other computer sites, including the Defense Department and NASA.\nId. at 4-5. Congress has the power to apply its statutes extraterritorially, and in the case of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030, it has clearly manifested its intention to do so.\n\n \n3. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029: The Access Device Statute\n\nSection 1029 of Title 18 of the United States Code provides for the imposition of criminal sanctions on any person who uses, possesses or traffics in a counterfeit access device \"if the offense affects interstate or foreign commerce.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029 (2000). As noted above, there is a centuries old canon of statutory construction to the effect that a statute should be construed so that no word or phrase is rendered superfluous. See, e.g., Platt v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 99 U.S. 48, 58, 9 Otto 48, 25 L. Ed. 424 (1878) (noting that the \"rules of statutory construction declare that a legislature is presumed to have used no superfluous words.\"). Therefore, based on the same reasoning applied above in the discussion of \u00a7 1030, the court concludes that the plain language of \u00a7 1029 indicates a congressional intent to apply the statute extraterritorially.\n\nThe parties agreed at oral argument that the legislative history of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029 mirrors that of \u00a7 1030. Therefore, the discussion above of the congressional intent behind \u00a7 1030 also applies to \u00a7 1029. Accordingly, the court finds that this section, too, was intended to apply extraterritorially.\n\n \n4. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371: The Conspiracy Statute\n\nThe Second Circuit has recently noted that where the court has jurisdiction over the underlying substantive criminal counts against a defendant, the court also has jurisdiction over the conspiracy counts. See Kim, 246 F.3d at 191, n. 2. A court may \"infer[] the extra-territorial reach of conspiracy statutes on the basis of a finding that the underlying substantive statute reached extra-territorial offenses, even though the conspiracy charges came under separate code sections ....\" United States v. Evans, 667 F. Supp. 974, 981 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). See also United States v. Yousef, 927 F. Supp. 673, 682 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (\"Extraterritorial jurisdiction over a conspiracy charge depends on whether extraterritorial jurisdiction exists as to the underlying substantive crime.\") Because the court finds that each of the underlying substantive statutes in this case was intended by Congress to apply extraterritorially, it also finds that it has jurisdiction over the conspiracy charge.\n\n \nIV. Conclusion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction [Doc. # 34] is hereby DENIED.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] An individual with \"root access\" who inputs the UNIX command \"rm-rf/\" will delete all files on the network server, including all operating system software.\n\n[2] Originally based on signal transmissions over telephone lines, the Internet connects computers and their users by means of a universal protocol, known as the Internet Protocol, or IP. The Internet assigns a unique IP address to each computer on the Internet and uses those addresses to relay \"packets\", i.e. small chunks of digital correspondence. \"When you send information across the Internet, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) first breaks it up into packets. Your computer sends those packets to your local network, Internet Service Provider (ISP), or online service. From there, the packets travel through many levels of networks, computers, and communications lines before they reach their final destination, which might be across town or around the world. A variety of hardware processes those packets and routes them to their proper destinations.\" Preston Gralla, How the Internet Works 9 (1999). The target computer then compiles the incoming packets and executes its processes accordingly. For example, an incoming packet might request the target computer to relay back images and text to be displayed as a web page on the requestor's Internet browser, or a series of incoming packets might be assembled as an email to be delivered to a user on the target's computer system.

In compliance with a plea agreement, Mr. Baker pleaded guilty to one count of distributing child pornography in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining counts. The district court sentenced Mr. Baker to 87 months' imprisonment, a term below the advisory guidelines range of 108 to 135 months. The court also imposed a lifetime of supervised release. The Government now appeals; it submits that the sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonably low. For the reasons set forth in the following opinion, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n2\n* BACKGROUND\n\nA. Facts\n\n3\nOn May 14, 2004, Mr. Baker entered a public online chatroom called \"gaymenteenboys.\" Using the screen name, \"perocks01,\" he conversed with \"bradnh14,\" who claimed to be a fourteen-year-old boy; bradnh14 even posted a picture of himself in his online profile. In actuality, bradnh14, or Brad, was Detective James McLaughlin of the Keene, New Hampshire Police Department, who was posing as a child; the picture in the online profile was of the detective as a young man.\n\n4\nMr. Baker corresponded with Detective McLaughlin, as bradnh14, for several months by email and online instant messages, as well as by a letter sent through the mail. During this time, Mr. Baker told Detective McLaughlin that he had engaged in sexual activities with at least two thirteen-year-old children. He also sent the detective various image files of young men: eight images were of young men in various stages of undress; three images were of nude prepubescent males engaged in explicit sexual acts. Mr. Baker expected to receive pictures of Brad in return.\n\n5\nOn August 4, 2004, Detective McLaughlin contacted the FBI Office in Peoria, Illinois, and informed FBI agents of his ongoing correspondence with Mr. Baker. The Central Illinois Cybercrime Unit, a cooperative law enforcement program involving federal and local prosecutors, local police and the FBI, initiated an investigation and began surveillance efforts. On the following day, members of the Cybercrime Unit observed Mr. Baker entering Heartland Community College in Normal, Illinois. From there, Mr. Baker emailed four images of child pornography to Detective McLaughlin. Contemporaneously, Mr. Baker received online correspondence from Detective McLaughlin, indicating that \"Brad\" had mailed a letter to Mr. Baker's former address in Bloomington, Illinois. Mr. Baker left the college, followed by surveillance officers. He proceeded directly to the specified address where he waited for the postman to arrive. After the mail was delivered, Mr. Baker returned home. A subsequent search of Mr. Baker's residence by members of the Cybercrime Unit resulted in the seizure of at least 300 images containing child pornography from Mr. Baker's computer and floppy disks in his possession. Some of the recovered images depicted sadistic abuse of a minor.\n\nB. District Court Proceedings\n\n6\nOn August 19, 2004, Mr. Baker was indicted on two counts of distribution of child pornography, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(1), and one count of possession of child pornography, see id. \u00a7 2252A(5)(B). After entering a plea agreement, Mr. Baker pleaded guilty to one count of distributing child pornography; the remaining counts were dismissed.\n\n7\nIn calculating the advisory imprisonment range under the November 2003 edition of the Sentencing Guidelines, the Presentence Report began with a base offense level of 17. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(a). It added two levels for possession of images of prepubescent minors under the age of 12, id. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(1); five levels for the distribution of child pornography with the expectation of receiving child pornography in return, id. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2)(B); four levels for images portraying sadistic and masochistic conduct, id. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3); two levels for use of a computer to transmit, receive and distribute the pornography, id. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5); and four levels for possession of between 300 and 600 images of child pornography, id. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6)(c). The total offense level, after a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, see id. \u00a7 3E1.1(b), was 31. Mr. Baker had no prior criminal record and was assigned a criminal history category of I. The result was an advisory guidelines range of 108 to 135 months' imprisonment.\n\n8\nMr. Baker did not object to the Presentence Report, but he did file a sentencing memorandum requesting leniency. The memorandum identifies several mitigating factors: Mr. Baker's complete cooperation with law enforcement; his good academic record in high school; his college and church attendance; the fact that his mother left the family while he was an infant; his father's itinerant lifestyle as a preacher; and his lack of any criminal record. He also attached letters from family, friends and past employers attesting to his good character and employment history. In light of these facts, Mr. Baker submitted that a sentence of 60 months' imprisonment was appropriate under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A),(B).\n\n9\nThe sentencing hearing was held on April 3, 2005. At this hearing, Mr. Baker called the Reverend Dr. Kent King-Nobles, the minister and pastoral counselor at Mr. Baker's church, who testified that he did not believe Mr. Baker was a danger to the community; he noted, however, that Mr. Baker probably should not be placed \"in a position where he is working with children.\" R.18 at 8. Mr. Baker also called Cary Hendricks, the director of youth ministry at Mr. Baker's church. Hendricks testified, based on his observation of Mr. Baker during his involvement with the church's youth ministry, that he did not consider Mr. Baker to be a danger to society; he also noted that an investigation at the church had not revealed any indication of inappropriate contact between Mr. Baker and the children under his charge. Id. at 18-21. On the basis of this testimony, defense counsel repeated his assertion that 60 months' imprisonment, which constitutes the mandatory minimum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b), would be sufficient to deter future misconduct, particularly if combined with treatment, a \"lengthy supervised release period\" and close monitoring. Id. at 36.\n\n10\nIn response, the Government submitted that none of the proposed mitigating factors discussed in Mr. Baker's sentencing memorandum, assessed either \"individually or collectively, really takes this case out of the norm.\" Id. at 29. While the Government conceded that Mr. Baker's \"good background,\" religious upbringing, lack of drug or alcohol addiction and solid educational and employment history were \"unusual in this courtroom,\" it nevertheless characterized these facts as merely \"advantages\" that should have kept Mr. Baker from turning to crime. Id. at 30.\n\n11\nThe district court began by remarking that this case was \"different in the sense that the defendant is not and does not have the appearance of a dirty old man who hangs out at playgrounds, preying on small children.\" Id. at 38. The court acknowledged Mr. Baker's representation to Detective McLaughlin that he had had sex with two 13-year-old boys, but gave Mr. Baker \"the benefit of a doubt,\" noting that Mr. Baker later recanted this version of events and that there was no evidence that he was not merely \"puffing.\" Id. at 40; but see id. at 41 (remarking that, although there is no evidence that Mr. Baker has ever molested a child, \"perhaps he was moving in that direction\"). Given Mr. Baker's \"crime free\" life, and the fact that \"a term of imprisonment would probably mean more to him and have a greater impact than on someone who had previous experience being incarcerated,\" the district court ultimately concluded that a lesser term of imprisonment was appropriate. Id.\n\n12\nAcknowledging the seriousness of the offense, but also expressing concern that the low end of the advisory range \u2014 108 months' imprisonment \u2014 likely could not be characterized as a sentence \"no greater than necessary to comply with purposes of sentencing,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court imposed a sentence of 87 months' imprisonment \u2014 21 months below the low end of the advisory guidelines range. The district court's sole written explanation of the sentence imposed reads:\n\n13\nThere is no evidence in the record to indicate that the defendant has acted out against any child. The sentence of 87 months is sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with sentencing purpose.\n\n14\nR.14. Mr. Baker's time in prison will be followed by a lifetime of supervised release unless the probation office determines that supervision is no longer necessary.\n\nII\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n15\nOn appeal, the Government contends that the 87-month sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonable, primarily because the district court failed to justify adequately, in writing, its downward departure from the advisory guidelines range. Specifically, according to the Government, the district court identified in writing only the lack of aggravating factors, see R.14 (concluding that \"[t]here is no evidence in the record to indicate that the defendant has acted out against any child\"), rather than the presence of mitigating factors, as required under the Guidelines to justify a departure from the advisory sentencing range. We review the sentence imposed by the district court, and its departure from the advisory sentencing range, for reasonableness in light of the factors specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). See United States v. Vaughn, 433 F.3d 917, 923-24 (7th Cir.2006).\n\n16\nPost-Booker, a district court has significantly more freedom than before Booker to fashion an appropriate sentence. Nevertheless, the district court is required to calculate properly the advisory sentencing range and to impose a sentence which takes into consideration the sentencing factors specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. Id. at 924. If the sentence falls within the advisory sentencing range recommended by the Guidelines, it is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness, see United States v. Mykytiuk, 415 F.3d 606, 608 (7th Cir.2005); if, however, the district court chooses to depart from the advisory Guidelines, it must offer adequate justification for that departure, see Vaughn, 433 F.3d at 924. Although there is no bright line standard for how much explication is necessary to support a discretionary sentence that is significantly above or below the guidelines range, \"the farther the judge's sentence departs from the guidelines sentence . . . the more compelling the justification based on factors in section 3553(a) that the judge must offer in order to enable the court of appeals to assess the reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\" United States v. Dean, 414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005).\n\n17\nOur task in the present case is not to decide whether 87 months' imprisonment could be a reasonable sentence; our function, as stipulated by the parties, is merely to assess whether the district court's choice of sentence was explained adequately. See United States v. Castro-Juarez, 425 F.3d 430, 433 (7th Cir.2005). The Government is correct to the extent that the district court's written statement, justifying the 87-month sentence, was short and includes little discussion of relevant \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. See R.14. Nevertheless, we never have held that our review of the district court's rationale, and ultimately the reasonableness of the sentence it imposed, is limited to the reasoning set forth in a written statement. In similar contexts, we have held that, so long as the sentencing court provides an adequate rationale for its decision, it is irrelevant whether that rationale is contained in a written statement or, alternatively, was articulated orally at the sentencing hearing. See United States v. Ortiz, 431 F.3d 1035, 1042-43 (7th Cir. 2005) (holding that, in the course of determining whether conduct supporting an enhanced sentence was sufficiently related to the offense of conviction, we review both the district court's written statement of reasons and its statements at sentencing to determine the sufficiency of its rationale); United States v. Arroyo, 406 F.3d 881, 889 (7th Cir.2005) (same). We adopt that rule in this context, as well, and review for thoroughness the district court's reasoning for sentencing Mr. Baker below the advisory guidelines range as contained in its written statement and as articulated during the sentencing hearings.\n\n18\nThe district court's rationale at Mr. Baker's sentencing hearing for departing from the advisory guidelines range is adequate and premised properly on the factors specified in \u00a7 3553(a). It also is sufficient to enable this court to \"assess the reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\" Dean, 414 F.3d at 729. Specifically, at this hearing, the district court paid close attention to Mr. Baker's lack of a criminal history, his relatively young age, his religious background and his history of both employment and higher education. The court's consideration of these facts, in turn, coincides with the sentencing factors specified in \u00a7 3553(a). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (directing sentencing courts to consider \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\"). Also significant is the district court's finding that a prison term would mean more to Mr. Baker than to a defendant who previously had been imprisoned. Consideration of this factor is consistent with \u00a7 3553's directive that the sentence reflect the need for \"just punishment,\" id. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and \"adequate deterrence,\" id. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). Moreover, recognizing the seriousness of the offense1 committed by Mr. Baker, the district court imposed special conditions designed to reduce the risk of Mr. Baker becoming a repeat offender, including a life-long term of supervised release, restrictions on future possession of child pornography and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with minors. This extended discussion, touching upon various significant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, was sufficiently proportional to the district court's deviation from the Guidelines to satisfy the requirements of Dean.\n\nConclusion\n\n19\nBecause the district court properly considered and applied the sentencing factors specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as adequately explained its rationale for departing from the advisory sentencing range, Mr. Baker's 87-month sentence cannot be considered unreasonable. Accordingly, we must affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n20\nAFFIRMED.\n\nNotes:\n\n1\nWe recently recognized that, while the PROTECT Act does not make the Sentencing Guidelines binding on district courts in child pornography cases, district courts nevertheless are required to give respectful attention to Congress' manifest intent that child crimes, such as the offense involved in the present case, be punished with the severity they deserveSee United States v. Grigg, 442 F.3d 560 (7th Cir.2006). The district court's statements at the sentencing hearing demonstrate respect for these concerns. The court noted:\n\nThe Court must protect young children as best it can because they are really not in a positioned [sic] to protect themselves because of their immaturity, lack of experience, and common sense.\n\nAnd there are children out there who are very aggressive sexually, who are shockingly advanced in their sexuality, and \u2014 but still they need protection from their own foolishness. The question here is how much incarceration is necessary to serve all of the purposes of sentencing and one of the most difficult decisions by a judge is making that determination.\n\nAs [the prosecutor] observed, the Sentencing Guidelines affords some guidance to the Court. They represent the considered judgment of Congress based upon the recommendations of scholars and others who have studied the situation, suggesting that a range of months should be a typical sentence imposed by this Court and any Court dealing with a similar situation. And that range of 108 to 135 months equates to approximately nine to 11 years. And the low end would be 108 months or nine years. The question in my mind then is nine years a sentence no greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing? One would like to impose a sentence that would not imprison the defendant for more than one day more than what is necessary.\n\nR.18 at 38-39. Given the court's consideration of congressional goals in making unlawful the possession and distribution of child pornography, as well as the court's assessment of the facts of Mr. Baker's offense and his background and characteristics, we conclude that the court's discussion and the ultimate sentence imposed adequately reflects the seriousness of Mr. Baker's offenses, as required by Grigg.",

BACKGROUND\n\nOn March 19, 2008, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment that charged the appellant with two counts of attempted receipt of child pornography, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2), (b)(1), and one count of knowing possession of child pornography, id. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B). We rehearse the relevant facts through the prism of the ensuing trial. The government's case relied in large part on testimony from agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Byron Mitchell, a member of the FBI's cyber crime unit, related that, on December 19, 2006, he mounted an online undercover investigation. To that end, he availed himself of LimeWire, a commercially available peer-to-peer networking program that allows file-sharing between unrelated computers. He entered a search term (\"Lolita\") that he knew to be favored by individuals who fancied child pornography. His query returned a number of files available for download, each associated with a particular Internet protocol (IP) address.\n\nBecause some of the file names were suggestive of child pornography, Mitchell activated LimeWire's \"browse the host\" function, which allowed him to view all of the files available for download from a particular user's \"shared files\" folder. Several of the revealed files contained words that Mitchell, an experienced agent, knew to be associated with child pornography. He downloaded a number of those files from that user's folder and confirmed that some appeared to contain child pornography. He then traced the associated IP address directly to the appellant.\n\nAt that point, another FBI agent, Sarah De Lair, took charge. After performing some preliminary investigation of her own, she obtained a search warrant for the appellant's home. On April 10, 2007, De Lair, accompanied by other law enforcement personnel, executed the warrant.\n\nDe Lair testified that when she knocked on the door, identified herself, and announced that she had a search warrant, the appellant permitted entry. Following a protective sweep, De Lair and another FBI agent, Bryan Zinn, conversed with the appellant. De Lair explained that the agents would be searching the premises for evidence of child pornography and advised the appellant of his Miranda rights. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S. Ct. 1602,  16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). The appellant replied that he understood his rights and signed a written waiver to that effect.\n\n*6 De Lair proceeded to question the appellant. The interview was not recorded, nor was the appellant ever asked to sign a written statement. The agents' version of the interview follows.\n\nThe appellant told De Lair that he, his sister, and his fianc\u00e9e all used the computers that were on the premises and that these computers held a goodly amount of child pornography (at least 15 files). He initially stated that he did not intentionally download any child pornography. He acknowledged, however, that he had opened suspiciously titled files obtained through LimeWire because he was curious about whether the file names reflected the actual contents of the files.\n\nHe claimed that he had used the LimeWire program to search for images of the World Trade Center. After downloading some such images, he clicked on a link entitled \"Vicki willing\" and watched a video of a young girl, eight to nine years of age, who was naked and engaged in a sexual act with an adult. The girl, he observed, was \"not doing anything good.\" The appellant estimated that he saw approximately five videos related to \"Vicki willing.\"\n\nIn the course of the interview, the appellant admitted to using search terms such as \"Lolita\" and \"young preteen.\" He also admitted that those searches yielded files that depicted prepubescent children, approximately seven or eight years old, \"not doing anything good.\" He acknowledged that he knew children were involved in child pornography and that he could tell if someone was less than 17 years of age. When De Lair showed him the titles of the two files containing child pornography that Agent Mitchell had downloaded and descriptions of their contents, the appellant stated that he recognized the titles but not the descriptions. Queried about whether he was \"attracted\" to child pornography, the appellant said that he was uncomfortable with the term \"attracted\" but admitted that he had been \"interested\" in child pornography (specifically, images depicting seven-to-ten-year-old children) for at least a year. Elaborating on this point, he noted that he looked at pornographic images of children three or four times per week and that he downloaded five to six such images once or twice per week.\n\nAs fruits of the search, the agents seized two computers. A forensic examination of one computer's hard drive revealed, among other files containing child pornography in the appellant's LimeWire shared files folder, the two videos that Agent Mitchell had downloaded. These two video files, each of which forms the basis for a separate count in the indictment, bore a creation date of October 21, 2006.\n\nNearly a year after the search, Agent De Lair tried to interview the appellant's sister at the sister's residence. By happenstance, she encountered the appellant, who told her that if he had known either that it was wrong or that anyone was watching, he would not have downloaded the files. Later, he left a voice message for De Lair, in which he indicated that he had made a mistake by having the materials on his computer. The government introduced a recording of this voice message at trial.\n\nThe appellant testified in his own defense. His account of these interactions diverged from the agents' accounts in some respects. We summarize portions of his version of what he told the agents.\n\nThe appellant maintained that he had used LimeWire to search for adult pornography and sometimes would (inadvertently) come across child pornography. If he opened a video that turned out to be child pornography, he would click out of it. While he admitted using search terms like *7 \"Lolita,\" he did not understand them to be associated with child pornography. He viewed the video entitled \"Vicki willing\" and clicked out of it. He did not, however, delete it. He never searched for child pornography or intentionally downloaded any child pornography.\n\nThe appellant did admit to having told the agents that there was child pornography on his computer, but explained that there were also other items on the computer that he did not want and had not sought. He denied having said that he was interested in child pornography. He had used LimeWire for only about a year, three or four times a week, and would download five or six \"search terms\" per week,[1] but without any intention of searching for, or downloading, child pornography. He denied having told Agent De Lair that he would not have downloaded the images in question had he known either that it was wrong or that someone was watching. Finally, he tried to explain away the \"mistake\" voicemail; he had meant to say \"I made a mistake by having the child pornography on the computer, but not intentionally.\"\n\nFaced with this chiaroscuro record, the jury found the appellant guilty of one count of attempted receipt of child pornography (count two) and one count of possession of child pornography (count three), and acquitted him on the other attempted receipt count (count one). Prior to the submission of the case to the jury, the appellant had moved for a judgment of acquittal as to count two. See Fed. R.Crim.P. 29(a). He renewed that motion post-verdict, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c), and he simultaneously moved for a new trial, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a). The district court denied both motions, and on January 6, 2010, sentenced the appellant to a five-year incarcerative term. This timely appeal followed.\n\nII. ANALYSIS\n\nThe appellant has briefed four claims of error. For ease in exposition, we divide our analysis into segments that correspond to these claims. We start with the one claim that seeks acquittal and then assay the three claims that seek the granting of a new trial.\n\nA. Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n\nThe appellant contends that, as to count two, the evidence was insufficient to prove the offense's knowledge and interstate commerce elements. We address these contentions sequentially. First, however, we rehearse the standard of review.\n\nWe assess preserved challenges to evidentiary sufficiency de novo, considering the evidence in the light most agreeable to the verdict. United States v. Rodr\u00edguez-V\u00e9lez, 597 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2010). Our appraisal is aimed at determining whether on this view of the record a reasonable juror could conclude that the government proved each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781,  61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979); United States v. Troy, 618 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2010).\n\n1. Knowledge. The appellant contends that the government failed to introduce evidence sufficient to establish that he knew, when he received the relevant video file, that it depicted real minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. This contention operates at three different but overlapping levels.\n\nFirst, the appellant tries to engraft an extra layer of mens rea onto the offense. *8 In his view, the government, by charging that he \"knowingly attempted to receive\" the images, had to prove that he knew the character of the material at the very moment of its acquisition. He insists that when he downloaded the file, he was aware only of its title, and he refers to testimony presented at trial for the proposition that titles do not always reliably indicate a file's actual contents. The appellant believes that this testimony demonstrates that he could not have known the video's actual contents on the basis of its name alone and therefore could not knowingly have attempted to receive it.\n\nThis argument is belied by the language of section 2252(a)(2), which criminalizes the knowing receipt of child pornography. We simply do not see how incorporating the statutory language into the charging document could have elevated the necessary proof beyond the elements required by the statute itself.\n\nThis brings us to the second level of the argument. To prove attempt, the government must show both that the accused intended to commit the underlying substantive offense (here, knowing receipt of child pornography) and that he took a substantial step toward committing that crime. United States v. Gobbi, 471 F.3d 302, 309 (1st Cir.2006). But this does not mean that the government bore a burden to prove each element of the underlying offense. While the underlying offense in this case requires the receipt of images of real-life minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, see United States v. McNealy, 625 F.3d 858, 870 & nn. 47-48 (5th Cir. 2010) (citing United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 78, 115 S. Ct. 464,  130 L. Ed. 2d 372 (1994)), the government in an \"attempt\" case has no burden to prove that the appellant knew that the downloaded file actually contained such images. Rather, the government is required to prove that the appellant believed that the received file contained such images. See United States v. Bauer, 626 F.3d 1004, 1008 (8th Cir.2010). No other view of the relevant threshold of proof comports with the Supreme Court's reasoning in United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 128 S. Ct. 1830, 170 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2008), in which the Court explained that \"[t]here is no First Amendment exception from the general principle of criminal law that a person attempting to commit a crime need not be exonerated because he has a mistaken view of the facts.\" Id. at 304, 128 S. Ct. 1830.\n\nThe third layer of the appellant's argument rests on the district court's jury instructions. Contrary to what the statute of conviction requires, the court told the jury that \"the government has to prove not just that the defendant voluntarily and intentionally, not by mistake, received a depiction, a video, but that he knew at the time of receipt that the production of that video involved the use of a real minor and that the video showed a real minor.\" This instruction plainly overstates the government's burden.\n\nIn circumstances where, as here, a district court overstates the government's burden of proof to the defendant's benefit in its charge to the jury, a reviewing court faced with a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence must measure that challenge against the correct legal standard, not against the erroneous standard set forth in the charge. See United States v. Bayes, 210 F.3d 64, 69 (1st Cir. 2000). With the correct standard as our metric, we conclude that the evidence, taken in the light most agreeable to the verdict, is sufficient to ground the conviction.\n\n\"[A] showing of scienter ... can (and often will) be made through circumstantial evidence.\" United States v. Hussein, *9 351 F.3d 9, 20 (1st Cir.2003). Here, the jury heard testimony from two FBI agents confirming that, by his own admission, the appellant deliberately used search terms associated with child pornography (such as \"Lolita\" and \"young preteen\") when trolling on LimeWire. This evidence is significant because a defendant's use of search terms associated with child pornography can support a finding that he knew that the images retrieved contained child pornography. See McNealy, 625 F.3d at 870-71. Such an inference is strengthened in this case by the appellant's statement to the agents that those searches yielded videos of children, approximately seven or eight years old, \"not doing anything good.\" In addition, the appellant admitted to the agents that he had had an interest in child pornography for about a year and that he had looked at child pornography three or four times a week, downloading five to six images containing child pornography once or twice a week. Nor was this all. The title of the file that underbraced count two was highly suggestive of child pornography.[2]\n\nTaking this tapestry of facts as a whole, we believe that the jury reasonably could have inferred that the appellant, having seen the name of the file, proceeded to download it; and that when he did so, he was seeking to acquire child pornography. Thus, the evidence supports a finding that the appellant acted \"knowingly\" with respect to count two.\n\n2. Interstate Commerce. The appellant's complaint that the government failed to prove the \"interstate commerce\" element of the offense of conviction\u2014that is, that the video file he attempted to receive traveled in interstate commerce\u2014 is squarely foreclosed by circuit precedent. See United States v. Lewis, 554 F.3d 208 (1st Cir.2009). In Lewis, we held that \"the government proved the images traveled interstate when it introduced evidence that [the defendant] received images that were transmitted over the Internet.\" Id. at 215. Given that the video file underlying count two in this case was also transmitted over the Internet, the holding in Lewis is of decretory significance.\n\nFor the most part, newly constituted panels in a federal appellate court are bound by prior panel decisions closely on point. Troy, 618 F.3d at 35; United States v. Rodr\u00edguez, 527 F.3d 221, 224 (1st Cir.2008); United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.1991). Although this permutation of the doctrine of stare decisis does not constitute an \"immutable rule,\" Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 215 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir.2000), it is subject to only a few \"narrowly cabined exceptions,\" Troy, 618 F.3d at 36; San Juan Cable LLC v. P.R. Tel. Co., 612 F.3d 25, 33 (1st Cir.2010). To be specific, a departure from circuit precedent is warranted only where the previous holding is \"contradicted by controlling authority, subsequently announced (say, a decision of the authoring court en banc, a Supreme Court opinion directly on point, or a legislative overruling),\" Rodr\u00edguez, 527 F.3d at 225, or in \"those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind,\" Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir.1995).\n\nThe appellant offers no serious claim that any of the exceptions to the law of the circuit rule applies. While he points to *10 United States v. Schaefer, 501 F.3d 1197, 1200-01 (10th Cir.2007), to suggest that our holding in Lewis is incorrect, the Tenth Circuit's decision in Schaefer predates Lewis. Consequently, it does not trigger any of the isthmian exceptions to the law of the circuit rule.\n\nThat ends this aspect of the matter. The holding in Lewis\u2014that evidence showing that images were received via the Internet is sufficient to satisfy the interstate commerce element under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2)\u2014applies here. Hence, the evidence of the appellant's use of the Internet to procure files via LimeWire is sufficient to ground a finding that the interstate commerce element of the offense was satisfied.\n\nB. Exclusion of Expert Testimony.\n\nDuring pretrial proceedings, the government moved to exclude certain expert testimony that the appellant proposed to present at trial. This testimony was to come from a forensic psychologist, Dr. Carol Ball. Her report stated in pertinent part that the appellant was \"free of major mental illness, antisocial personality traits, and sexual deviance\" and was \"not a pedophile or sexual psychopath.\" The parties sharply disagreed about the admissibility of this testimony: the appellant asserted that it was relevant because it \"demonstrates the absence of motive for the alleged crimes\"; the government asserted that it was not relevant to any element of the charged crimes. The district court found that the proffered testimony might be relevant but that its relevance was \"outweighed by the danger of confusion of the issues or misleading the jury.\" Citing Federal Rule of Evidence 403, the court granted the motion in limine. It later denied a motion for reconsideration. The appellant assigns error to the exclusion of this testimony.\n\nWe review a trial court's decision to exclude evidence for abuse of discretion. United States v. Stierhoff, 549 F.3d 19, 27 (1st Cir.2008); United States v. Zaccaria, 240 F.3d 75, 78 (1st Cir.2001). This deferential standard normally precludes us from substituting our judgment for that of the district court absent an obvious mistake. Torres-Arroyo v. Rull\u00e1n, 436 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2006). Within this rubric, abstract legal questions are reviewed de novo with the understanding that a material error of law is always an abuse of discretion. United States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir.1998).\n\nIn this case the expert witness, Dr. Ball, was prepared to testify that the appellant did not have major mental illness, antisocial personality traits, sexual deviance, or prurient interest in children of any age. The appellant advances three related objections to the exclusion of her testimony. He asseverates that the court applied an incorrect legal standard, that it undervalued the probative worth of the proffered evidence while simultaneously overvaluing its potential as a source of jury confusion, and that the order in limine infringed on his constitutionally assured right to present a defense. We examine each component of this asseverational array.\n\n1. Rule 403 Standard. The appellant's plaint that the district court failed to apply the correct legal standard does not withstand scrutiny. This plaint focuses on language in Rule 403 that states: \"Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury....\" The appellant suggests that the district court skewed this standard by considering whether the prejudicial effect of the evidence merely outweighed its probative value, rather than whether the former substantially outweighed the latter. This *11 argument rests almost exclusively on the court's statement, in the order granting the motion in limine, that the evidence's \"probative value is outweighed by the danger of confusion of the issues or misleading the jury.\" To the appellant's way of thinking, the court's failure to use the modifying adverb \"substantially\" reflects that it applied an incorrect standard.\n\nWe disagree. Elsewhere in the same order, the court quoted the pertinent language of Rule 403, correctly describing the \"substantially outweighed\" benchmark. Nothing in the court's discussion indicates that it ignored that articulated standard when balancing the competing interests and deciding to exclude Dr. Ball's testimony. Where, as here, a court's fidelity to the proper legal standard is fairly discernable from the whole of an order, we will not infer the worst from a misspoken word or misplaced phrase. See, e.g., United States v. Pelletier, 469 F.3d 194, 204 (1st Cir.2006); Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm., 998 F.2d 1083, 1088 (1st Cir.1993). So long as its overall meaning is clear, each word of a court's decision need not be precise to the point of pedantry.\n\n2. Balancing. We turn next to the appellant's claim that the district court miscalibrated the balance between probative value and potential jury confusion. To begin, evidence that bears on the question of motive ordinarily has some probative value in a criminal case. See, e.g., United States v. MacPherson, 424 F.3d 183, 185 n. 2 (2d Cir.2005); United States v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90, 100 (1st Cir.2002). The district court recognized this connection, stating that evidence of the appellant's \"lack of interest in images of children makes it somewhat less likely that he was searching for child pornography.\" On the same basis, the proffered testimony had some probative value with respect to the issue of intent. See United States v. Varoudakis, 233 F.3d 113, 120 (1st Cir.2000) (\"[P]roof of motive must be offered to show some other element, for example, ... the accused's requisite mental state.\")\n\nHere, however, the appropriate analysis is more nuanced. In enacting the federal child pornography statute, Congress proscribed certain conduct without regard to the underlying motive. See United States v. Dyer, 589 F.3d 520, 529 (1st Cir.2009); United States v. Matthews, 209 F.3d 338, 350-52 (4th Cir.2000). Thus, other courts have upheld evidentiary rulings excluding evidence of lack of motive in cases brought under the statute of conviction. Of particular note is United States v. Wallenfang, 568 F.3d 649 (8th Cir.2009), in which the Eighth Circuit upheld the exclusion of expert testimony about the defendant's psychosexual proclivities, offered to show lack of motive, because his motive for possessing child pornography was \"immaterial and irrelevant\" and the relevant inquiry was instead \"whether, on their face, [the pictures] appear to be of a sexual character.\" Id. at 660 (quoting United States v. Kemmerling, 285 F.3d 644, 646 (8th Cir.2002)).\n\nIn this case, the relevant images plainly appeared to be child pornography. Moreover, the appellant admitted possessing them. The key question, then, centered on his intent, that is, whether he knowingly received and possessed them. Under these circumstances, the proffered testimony was of diminished relevance. The district court appears to have appreciated this distinction, noting the likelihood that Dr. Ball's testimony, if admitted, might well \"shift attention away from [a] key question\u2014whether defendant had knowledge of the contents of the videos\u2014to a wholly irrelevant one\u2014whether or not he is a pedophile.\" While the two inquiries are more intertwined than the district court's analysis might suggest, we agree *12 that the proposed testimony was likely to confuse the jury and divert its attention from the central question in the case.\n\nThe fact that the excluded evidence took the form of expert testimony figures conspicuously in the decisional calculus. Qualified expert witnesses generally may offer opinion testimony if that testimony \"will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Fed.R.Evid. 702. But expert testimony remains subject to exclusion under Rule 403. See United States v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 783 (1st Cir.1994). Indeed, such evidence presents a special level of complexity in constructing the balance between probative value and unfairly prejudicial effect. This complexity arises out of the concern that, because of an expert's stature qua expert, jurors may assign more weight to expert testimony than it deserves. See United States v. Rodr\u00edguez-Berr\u00edos, 573 F.3d 55, 72 (1st Cir.2009). Because such testimony can carry with it an unwarranted \"aura of special reliability and trustworthiness,\" United States v. Fosher, 590 F.2d 381, 383 (1st Cir.1979), courts must guard against letting it intrude in areas that jurors, by dint of common experience, are uniquely competent to judge without the aid of experts. This concern, where pertinent, should legitimately factor into a trial court's Rule 403 analysis. See, e.g., Montas, 41 F.3d at 784.\n\nSo it is here. The intent issue in this case presents the type of judgment that jurors historically have made without the assistance of expert testimony. It follows, we think, that the proffered testimony presented a special risk of jury confusion.\n\nIn arguing against exclusion, the appellant relies heavily on United States v. Shay, 57 F.3d 126 (1st Cir.1995), in which we concluded that the district court erred in excluding, under Rule 702, expert testimony from a psychiatrist who was prepared to testify that the defendant suffered from a recognized mental disorder that caused him to tell self-aggrandizing lies in order to place himself at the center of attention. Id. at 129-30, 133-34. But Shay and the case at hand are not fair congeners. First, the court in Shay focused on Rule 702, not Rule 403. Second\u2014and more important\u2014the proffers in the two cases were quite different. In Shay, the expert testimony, if believed, would have exculpated the defendant, conclusively explaining away what appeared to be damning admissions on which the government's case relied. See id. at 133. In this case, however, the proffered expert testimony was much more peripheral; at best, it may have borne on the appellant's lack of motive and thus, indirectly, on the question of whether he had the level of knowledge required by the statute. A jury, accepting everything that Dr. Ball had to say, could very well have convicted the appellant anyway.\n\n\"Where (as here) a piece of evidence is determined to be relevant, the district court has wide discretion in steadying the Rule 403 seesaw.\" Onujiogu v. United States, 817 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir.1987). \"Only rarely\u2014and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances\u2014will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.1988). Whether the danger of jury confusion here substantially outweighs the probative value of Dr. Ball's testimony is fairly debatable, but the very closeness of the question favors the district court's reconciliation of the competing centrifugal and centripetal forces. Consequently, this is not one of the rare cases in which appellate intervention is justified. *13 Given the circumstances of this case, the district court's ruling was within the universe of reasonable decisions and, thus, was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n3. Constitutional Claim. It is a bedrock principle that a criminal defendant's right \"to offer witnesses in his defense is a fundamental component of due process.\" United States v. Brown, 500 F.3d 48, 57 (1st Cir.2007) (citing Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967)). But \"the mere assertion of that right does not automatically and inevitably ensure the admissibility of the proffered testimony.\" Id. (citing Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400, 414-15, 108 S. Ct. 646, 98 L. Ed. 2d 798 (1988)). In particular, the right to present a defense does not trump valid rules of evidence.\n\nHere, our conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the proffered expert testimony undermines the appellant's constitutional claim. This exclusionary decision fell within the ambit of discretion afforded under Rule 403. The appellant has not developed any argument that meaningfully distinguishes his constitutional claim from his more generic assertion, previously rejected, that the district court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Ball's testimony. Nor does he argue that Rule 403 itself offends the Constitution.\n\nTo say more about this claim would be supererogatory. We hold, without serious question, that the exclusion of the evidence did not abridge the appellant's constitutional right to present a defense. See Rodr\u00edguez-Berr\u00edos, 573 F.3d at 72 n. 16.\n\nC. Prosecutorial Misconduct.\n\nThe appellant argues that prosecutorial misstatements during closing argument entitle him to a new trial. He lodged contemporaneous objections to only two of the statements that he identifies. As to those two statements, our review is de novo. United States v. Ayala-Garc\u00eda, 574 F.3d 5, 16 (1st Cir.2009). The remainder of the statements engender review for plain error. United States v. S\u00e1nchez-Berr\u00edos, 424 F.3d 65, 73 (1st Cir.2005). We therefore analyze the statements in two groups.\n\n1. Preserved Claims. During the summation, the appellant objected to the following statement by the prosecutor:\n\n[I]n this case knowing possession is essentially conceded. In the opening statement by defense counsel and in defendant's own words, he told you he knew he had child pornography on his computer.\nThe appellant protests that this assertion erroneously equates \"knowing\" in the colloquial sense of \"being aware\" with the legal definition that applies to the charges brought in this case.\n\nThe prosecutor's statement must be evaluated in conjunction with the law applicable to the case. To be found guilty of knowing possession, an individual need only have known that there was child pornography on his computer yet declined to delete it. United States v. Carani, 492 F.3d 867, 875 (7th Cir.2007). He need not know the material's character at the moment that he downloads it, as long as he thereafter learns its character and nevertheless retains it. Id. Evidence of a defendant's awareness that computer files contain child pornography is adequate to show that he knowingly possessed that material. United States v. Hilton, 257 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir.2001).\n\nIn the instant case, the appellant admitted that he was aware that there were files containing child pornography on his computer and that at least some of them had not been deleted. The prosecutor's *14 statement was, therefore, an accurate rendition of both the law and the record. Consequently, the district court did not err in overruling the appellant's objection to it.\n\nThe appellant also objected to the prosecutor's assertion that the appellant told the FBI agents \"that he viewed five `Vicki willing' files.\" He protests that this statement was inconsistent with Agent De Lair's testimony that the appellant had stated that \"there were approximately five videos associated with the `Vicki willing' link.\" That testimony, the appellant says, did not clearly indicate that he actually viewed the videos. The appellant's complaint, however, overlooks entirely testimony from Agent Zinn, who stated that the appellant \"estimated that he saw about\u2014 approximately five videos that were related to `Vicki willing.'\" Agent Zinn's testimony made multiple references to videos and images that the appellant told him that he \"saw\" and included descriptions of the contents of these files, indicating that the appellant had actually viewed them. The prosecutor's statement regarding the \"Vicki\" videos was thus a fair characterization of the agents' testimony, taken in context.\n\nViewed against this backdrop, the appellant's objection was appropriately overruled.\n\n2. Unpreserved Claims. We can deal swiftly with the remainder of the challenged statements (which we review only for plain error). To establish plain error, an appellant must make four showings: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). He must satisfy all of these requirements in order to obtain relief. S\u00e1nchez-Berr\u00edos, 424 F.3d at 73. This is a daunting standard: \"under plain error review, we have leeway to correct only the most egregious of unpreserved errors.\" Id.\n\nWhen determining whether alleged prosecutorial misstatements sink to the level of plain error, we evaluate the statements within the context of the case as a whole. United States v. Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d 849, 854 (1st Cir. 1993). We will intervene only if a statement \"so poisoned the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\" United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 977 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting United States v. Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268, 274 (1st Cir.1987)). \"We are guided in making this determination by a number of factors, including the frequency and deliberateness of the prosecutor's comments, the strength and clarity of the trial judge's instructions, and the strength of the government's case against the defendant.\" Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d at 854.\n\nWe need not recount in detail the statements about which the appellant now complains. For present purposes, it suffices to say that we have reviewed each of them in the context of the record as a whole. Most involve instances in which the prosecutor asked jurors to draw inferences from the evidence. It is eminently proper for a prosecutor\u2014like any other lawyer\u2014to attempt to persuade the jury to draw reasonable inferences favorable to her case. United States v. O'Shea, 426 F.3d 475, 485 (1st Cir.2005); United States v. Hamie, 165 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir.1999). With one possible exception, the challenged statements fell within this safe harbor.\n\nThe only statement that requires specific comment involves a misquotation of the appellant's voicemail message. The *15 prosecutor told the jury that in this message the appellant said, \"I got caught. I'm sorry.\" Those precise words were never spoken. At best the prosecutor's account was a rough paraphrase of what the appellant had said.\n\nThere is nothing in the record, however, to indicate that this misquotation was deliberate. Moreover, the likelihood of harm was minuscule. A recording of the voicemail message was introduced into evidence, and the jury took it into the jury room. This is particularly important because the court instructed the jurors that the statements of counsel were not evidence but, rather, that their recollection of the evidence, not the lawyers' recollections, should control. We have noted before, and today reaffirm, that such a prophylactic instruction is a significant safeguard against an advocate's tendency to confuse what a witness actually said with what he wished the witness had said. See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 36 (1st Cir.2006); Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d at 855.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, we discern nothing approximating plain error. There is no realistic possibility that this isolated comment made the slightest difference in the outcome.\n\nD. Multiplicity.\n\nFinally, the appellant posits that he is entitled to a new trial on count two because counts one and two of the indictment were multiplicitous. Specifically, he says that the government failed to offer evidence to show that the two video files alleged to have been received on or about October 21, 2006 (each of which was the basis of a discrete count) were downloaded in separate and distinct transactions. Assuming for argument's sake that this challenge remains open,[3] it fails on the merits.\n\n\"A district court's disposition of a Rule 33 motion for a new trial in a criminal case is ordinarily a `judgment call.'\" United States v. Connolly, 504 F.3d 206, 211 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 489 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir.2007)). Such a ruling engenders review for abuse of discretion. Id. Here, however, the appellant's thesis depends on an abstract question of law, which we review de novo. See United States v. Huddleston, 194 F.3d 214, 218 (1st Cir.1999); see also Snyder, 136 F.3d at 67.\n\nThe rule against multiplicitous prosecutions is grounded in the Double Jeopardy Clause, which \"protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\" Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U.S. 410, 415, 100 S. Ct. 2260, 65 L. Ed. 2d 228 (1980) (quoting North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717,  89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969)). When an indictment includes multiple counts charging a violation of the same statutory provision and a claim of multiplicity is raised, an inquiring court must determine whether the facts undergirding each count can be treated as a distinct unit of prosecution. See United States v. Hinkeldey, 626 F.3d 1010, 1013 (8th Cir.2010); cf. United States v. LeMoure, 474 F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir.2007) (observing, with respect to claim of multiplicity, that \"[m]ultiple punishments for the same offense ... are permissible if the legislature so intended\"). \"The critical inquiry is whether Congress intended to punish each statutory violation separately.\" Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 155, 97 S. Ct. 2207, 53 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1977).\n\n*16 Counts one and two both charged the appellant with attempted receipt of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2), which makes it unlawful to \"knowingly receive[] ... any visual depiction\" involving \"the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\"[4] The record contains no evidence that might establish that the two files at issue here were received in separate and distinct transactions. The government appears to concede that the allowable unit of prosecution for the appellant's attempted receipt of videos containing child pornography, on a single day and without proof of multiple transactions, is one, not two. See United States v. Polouizzi, 564 F.3d 142, 158 (2d Cir.2009) (concluding that the rule of lenity requires that a person who receives multiple prohibited images in a single transaction can only be charged with one violation under section 2252(a)(2)). Thus, there is a credible basis for a multiplicity claim.\n\nThe potential for such a claim dissipated, however, once the jury acquitted the appellant on count one and convicted him on count two. This split decision eliminated any prospect of double jeopardy. That makes a dispositive difference.\n\nThe appellant attempts to blunt the impact of this split decision by suggesting that, had the district court recognized the multiplicity concern when that concern was first voiced (at the close of the government's case in chief), the government would have been compelled to elect between counts one and two\u2014and it might have guessed wrong as to which count it should jettison. This suggestion misses the mark.\n\nThere is no inflexible rule that the exclusive remedy for multiplicitous counts is election between them. See Ball v. United States, 470 U.S. 856, 864,  105 S. Ct. 1668, 84 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1985). Requiring election is one option, but not the only option; the court may, for example, simply vacate both the conviction and the sentence as to all but one count, essentially merging the offending counts. See, e.g., id.; United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 306 (1st Cir.1992). This flexible approach makes good sense because \"the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one punishment is eventually imposed.\" United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam).\n\nIn the case at hand, the appellant was convicted and sentenced on only one of the two purportedly multiplicitous counts. Consequently, his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause were not infracted. See id. That fact is fatal to the thesis that he advances here: a multiplicity claim is necessarily premised on double jeopardy concerns, and where such concerns have been eliminated, the multiplicity claim evaporates. The court below did not err in denying the appellant's motion for a new trial predicated on this ground.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\nWe need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, the appellant's challenges come to naught.\n\nAffirmed.\n\nNOTES\n\n[*] Hon. David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\n[1] Although this phraseology seems odd, we think that the jury reasonably could have inferred from it that the appellant downloaded the results of five or six searches each week.\n\n[2] The file name was: \"cp tvg 13 Bond 10-11-12Yo Childlover Little Collection Video 0039 Girl-Vicky String Bikini Pthc 11Yo Pedofilia.mpg.\"\n\n[3] The government asserts that this challenge was waived by the appellant's failure to attack the indictment prior to trial. See Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B). We take no view on the waiver question.\n\n[4] Each count also mentions 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(1), which criminalizes the attempted violation of section 2252(a)(2). This additional reference is of no consequence in the multiplicity analysis.", "annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 50}, {"start": 51, "end": 89}, {"start": 90, "end": 112}, {"start": 113, "end": 146},

Introduction\n\nAppellant Ruben Wenger appeals his conviction on three counts of promotion of child pornography and four counts of possession of child pornography as alleged in the same indictment. Appellant argues that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support his conviction on the promotion counts and that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling his *194 hearsay objection and in admitting extraneous offense evidence of possession of child pornography.\n\nII. Factual and procedural background\n\nSergeant Ried, an agent with the Attorney General's Cyber Crimes unit, testified that on November 28, 2005, he used file-sharing software called Shareaza to access the Internet through a covert access point in his office in Austin. Shareaza is a peer-to-peer[1] file sharing software that allows a user to search for music, movies, and image files and download them from other Shareaza users' computers. A Shareaza user can type exactly what he or she is looking for via search terms, and a results list will appear with download links for the user to choose from. The software also allows a user to select another user's Internet protocol (\"IP\") address[2] and browse all files available from that user's collection. Downloads from Shareaza are automatically placed in a \"Shared\" folder created by the software on the user's computer. By default, Shareaza automatically shares the items downloaded with other Shareaza users.\n\nFor his investigation, Sergeant Ried used a special search term popular in the child pornography community and discovered several results. Over Appellant's hearsay objection, the trial court allowed Sergeant Ried to testify that he downloaded child pornography files from the IP address assigned to Appellant by his Internet service provider. He stated that IP addresses are like telephone numbers, assigned to only one person. Based on the child pornography[3] Sergeant Ried downloaded from Appellant's IP address, he obtained a grand jury subpoena and a search warrant. Police executed the warrant on Appellant's residence on February 8, 2006. Sergeant Ried retrieved a computer from the residence and took a statement from Appellant's wife.\n\nDuring trial, the State played an audio recording of a February 8, 2006 interview between Sergeant Ried, Sergeant Smith, and Appellant while they were at the Fort Worth police substation after the warrant was executed. Sergeant Ried testified that, before taking the statement, he read Appellant his Miranda[4] rights and did not make any promises or threats regarding Appellant's making the statement. In the recording, Sergeant Ried read the Miranda rights, told Appellant that he was not under arrest, and informed Appellant that he could ask to go home at any time. Appellant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights and spoke with the officers.\n\nAfter waiving his Miranda rights, Appellant confirmed that he was the primary user of both the computer and the installed Shareaza software. He claimed that a neighborhood child used the computer occasionally, along with his son. He stated that he formerly used the file-sharing software *195 Kazaa but switched to Shareaza. He installed Shareaza and registered his name, hometown, state, and zip code on the software's user information section. He registered his user name as \"C.W.\" because his nickname was Chip Wenger. Appellant stated initially that he had only movies and \"straight\" pornographic images on his computer. He denied having child pornography and stated that he did not know how it came to be on his computer unless it was \"clicked on accidentally.\" He stated that he \"[tried] to view everything that gets downloaded.\" Appellant admitted that he had searched for files containing the words \"young\" and \"Lolita,\" but denied having used other search terms associated with child pornography.\n\nAfter Sergeant Ried confronted Appellant by informing him that he had personally downloaded child pornography from Appellant's IP address, Appellant admitted that the ages of the children in the videos on his computer were \"very early teens\" and that the youngest child was \"probably eight.\" Appellant described the video of the youngest child and said that the video was in his \"Shared\" folder. He explained that he was curious about the visual material. Appellant denied finding the material sexually arousing, but compared his viewing of the pornographic images and videos to the \"Taliban beheading [video],\" stating that \"you'd watch it even though you find it disgusting, but you are drawn to it.\" He admitted he knew it was illegal.\n\nWhen asked if he knew how many times he had \"allowed people to upload those videos of child pornography from [his] computer,\" Appellant replied that he \"had no idea.\" When asked if he was \"aware that [it was possible for] people [to] upload... [his] files,\" Appellant stated, \"I'm assuming that it is, ... but I think it says that it is\u2014that's part of Shareaza is that []... that's your way to use it is that people pull files from members.\" Appellant then claimed that he \"did not know how to not share and share and separate those items out.\" He ultimately admitted that there were \"probably 300\" videos of child pornography on his computer. Appellant described some files as located in folders that had titles such as \"extreme,\" \"amateur,\" \"group,\" \"toy,\" and \"young.\" He explained that after he obtained the files from Shareaza, he would create \"subfolders\" and move the files.[5]\n\nThe State offered into evidence the files that Sergeant Ried downloaded from Appellant's IP address during his November investigation.[6] Sergeant Ried stated that the files included both videos and photo images of children under eighteen, including the children's genitalia and children engaging in sexual activity. He testified that one can preview partially downloaded files on Shareaza.\n\nWhile Sergeant Ried testified about the steps of his investigative process on November 28, 2005, the State offered into evidence an exhibit of Shareaza screen captures[7] that showed a folder on a computer *196 at Appellant's IP address with a list of labeled subfolders and 900 files that included file names graphically describing both adult and child pornography. After a rule 403 objection and lengthy voir dire, the trial court overruled the objection and admitted the screen captures into evidence. The trial court gave Appellant a running objection to that evidence.\n\nDetective Lawrence testified that he worked in the Computer Crime Detail of the Major Crimes section of the Fort Worth Police Department, where he investigated computer crimes and conducted computer forensics. He conducted a forensic examination on Appellant's computer after it was seized. He located the images alleged in the indictment on Appellant's computer and testified that, in his opinion, those images constituted child pornography.\n\nDetective Lawrence explained that Appellant had stored his pornography under the \"My Documents\" folder of a second hard drive, D:. He stated that the terms used in the file names, such as \"age 6-3 (reelkiddymov child abuse underage preteen r@ygold bond age rape molest).mpg,\" were common to his child pornography investigations. He testified that one file was last accessed on February 7, 2006. He also testified about the organization of the files on the second hard drive and stated that they were \"pretty well organized.\" He stated that, in his opinion, Appellant's possession of the child pornography was not inadvertent, based on the organizational structure of the files and the number of files on the computer.\n\nDetective Lawrence confirmed that he found on Appellant's computer all three of the files Sergeant Ried had downloaded via Shareaza on November 28, 2005. Detective Lawrence added that there were other child pornography pictures found in several subfolders other than the \"young\" subfolder. He also testified that unlike the default Shareaza installation, where downloaded files are automatically shared, Appellant's computer had separate folders for downloaded and shared files and that files had to be moved from the \"Download\" folder to the \"Shared\" folder to share the files in question. He demonstrated how a person could make changes to his or her sharing settings by simply selecting \"Shareaza Settings.\"\n\nAppellant was charged by indictment with promotion of child pornography by disseminating visual material on counts one through three of the indictment and possession of child pornography on counts four through seven. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts and assessed a punishment of fifteen years for each promotion count and ten years for each possession count, with some of the sentences consecutive and others concurrent.\n\nIII. Legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence for intentional promotion by dissemination\n\nAppellant argues that there was insufficient evidence to prove he actually and intentionally disseminated child pornography or that he had specific knowledge that the material was child pornography prior to dissemination because there was no proof that he saw the three files alleged to have been shared or that he intended to share the same.\n\na. Legal sufficiency: standard of review\n\nIn reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution in order to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. *197 2781, 2789, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979); Clayton v. State, 235 S.W.3d 772, 778 (Tex.Crim. App.2007).\n\nThis standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789; Clayton, 235 S.W.3d at 778. The trier of fact is the sole judge of the weight and credibility of the evidence. See Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.04 (Vernon 1979); Brown v. State, 270 S.W.3d 564, 568 (Tex. Crim.App.2008), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S. Ct. 2075, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1139 (2009). Thus, when performing a legal sufficiency review, we may not re-evaluate the weight and credibility of the evidence and substitute our judgment for that of the factfinder. Dewberry v. State, 4 S.W.3d 735, 740 (Tex.Crim.App.1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1131, 120 S. Ct. 2008, 146 L. Ed. 2d 958 (2000). Instead, we \"determine whether the necessary inferences are reasonable based upon the combined and cumulative force of all the evidence when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict.\" Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 9, 16-17 (Tex.Crim.App.2007). We must presume that the factfinder resolved any conflicting inferences in favor of the prosecution and defer to that resolution. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 326, 99 S.Ct. at 2793; Clayton, 235 S.W.3d at 778.\n\nb. Factual sufficiency: standard of review\n\nWhen reviewing the factual sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we view all the evidence in a neutral light, favoring neither party. Neal v. State, 256 S.W.3d 264, 275 (Tex.Crim.App.2008); Watson v. State, 204 S.W.3d 404, 414 (Tex. Crim.App.2006). We then ask whether the evidence supporting the conviction, although legally sufficient, is nevertheless so weak that the factfinder's determination is clearly wrong and manifestly unjust or whether conflicting evidence so greatly outweighs the evidence supporting the conviction that the factfinder's determination is manifestly unjust. Lancon v. State, 253 S.W.3d 699, 704 (Tex.Crim.App.2008); Watson, 204 S.W.3d at 414-15, 417. To reverse under the second ground, we must determine, with some objective basis in the record, that the great weight and preponderance of all the evidence, though legally sufficient, contradicts the verdict. Watson, 204 S.W.3d at 417.\n\nIn determining whether the evidence is factually insufficient to support a conviction that is nevertheless supported by legally sufficient evidence, it is not enough that this court \"harbor a subjective level of reasonable doubt to overturn [the] conviction.\" Id. We cannot conclude that a conviction is clearly wrong or manifestly unjust simply because we would have decided differently than the jury or because we disagree with the jury's resolution of a conflict in the evidence. Id. We may not simply substitute our judgment for the factfinder's. Johnson v. State, 23 S.W.3d 1, 12 (Tex.Crim.App.2000); Cain v. State, 958 S.W.2d 404, 407 (Tex.Crim.App.1997). Unless the record clearly reveals that a different result is appropriate, we must defer to the jury's determination of the weight to be given contradictory testimonial evidence because resolution of the conflict \"often turns on an evaluation of credibility and demeanor, and those jurors were in attendance when the testimony was delivered.\" Johnson, 23 S.W.3d at 8. Thus, unless we conclude that it is necessary to correct manifest injustice, we must give due deference to the factfinder's determinations, \"particularly those determinations concerning the weight and credibility of the evidence.\" Id. at 9. Our deference in this regard safeguards the defendant's *198 right to a trial by jury. Lancon, 253 S.W.3d at 704. An opinion addressing factual sufficiency must include a discussion of the most important and relevant evidence that supports the appellant's complaint on appeal. Sims v. State, 99 S.W.3d 600, 603 (Tex.Crim.App.2003).\n\nc. Applicable law\n\nThe offense of promotion of child pornography is described under penal code section 43.26(e), which provides that \"a person commits an offense if: (1) the person knowingly or intentionally promotes or possesses with intent to promote material described by Subsection (a)(1); and (2) the person knows that the material depicts the child as described by Subsection (a)(1).\" Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 43.26(e) (Vernon 2003). Section (a)(1) of the statute describes the offense of possession of child pornography: \"[a] person commits an offense if: (1) the person knowingly or intentionally possesses visual material that visually depicts a child younger than 18 years of age at the time the image of the child was made who is engaging in sexual conduct.\" Id. \u00a7 43.26(a).\n\nThe term \"promote,\" as defined under section 43.25(a) of the penal code, means \"to procure, manufacture, issue, sell, give, provide, lend, mail, deliver, transfer, transmit, publish, distribute, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit, or advertise or to offer or agree to do any of the above.\" Id. \u00a7 43.25(a)(5) (Vernon 2007). A person acts intentionally, or with intent, with respect to the nature of his conduct or to a result of his conduct when it is his conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or cause the result. Id. \u00a7 6.03(a) (Vernon 2003). A person acts knowingly, or with knowledge, with respect to the nature of his conduct or to circumstances surrounding his conduct when he is aware of the nature of his conduct or that the circumstances exist or when he is aware that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result. See id. \u00a7 6.03(b).\n\nCircumstantial evidence can be used to prove intent and knowledge. See Guevara v. State, 152 S.W.3d 45, 50 (Tex. Crim.App.2004); Dillon v. State, 574 S.W.2d 92, 94 (Tex.Crim.App.1978); Krause v. State, 243 S.W.3d 95, 111 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. ref'd). The trier of fact may infer intent and knowledge from the acts, words, and conduct of the accused. Guevara, 152 S.W.3d at 50; Dues v. State, 634 S.W.2d 304, 305 (Tex.Crim.App.1982).\n\nd. Analysis\n\nAppellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on three grounds. Appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to prove (1) that he actually disseminated the child pornography; (2) if he disseminated the child pornography, that the dissemination was intentional or knowing; and (3) that he knew the files in question contained child pornography before Sergeant Ried downloaded them from his computer. We will address each ground separately in our analysis.\n\n1. Actual dissemination\n\nIn the first part of his sufficiency challenge, Appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to prove that he actually \"disseminated\" child pornography. Implicit in his argument is the question of whether sharing digital files through peer-to-peer software like Shareaza constitutes \"dissemination.\"\n\nSeveral courts have held that making child pornography available for others to access and download through peer-to-peer file-sharing software qualifies as \"distribution\" or \"delivery\" to others. See United States v. Sewell, 513 F.3d 820, 822 (8th Cir.2008) (stating that, in the context of file-sharing software Kazaa, \"placing a file *199 in a shared folder with descriptive text is clearly an offer to distribute the file\"), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 128 S. Ct. 2517,  171 L. Ed. 2d 789 (2008); United States v. Carani, 492 F.3d 867, 876 (7th Cir.2007) (holding that making pornography available on file-sharing software qualifies as \"distribution\"), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 128 S. Ct. 932, 169 L. Ed. 2d 769 (2008); United States v. Shaffer, 472 F.3d 1219, 1223 (10th Cir.2007) (concluding that Shaffer distributed child pornography in the sense of having \"delivered,\" \"transferred,\" \"dispersed,\" or \"dispensed\" it to others via his computerized stash of images and videos within his Kazaa file-sharing software).\n\nIn United States v. Shaffer, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals analogized the making available of child pornography through peer-to-peer file sharing software to a self-serve gas station. See Shaffer, 472 F.3d at 1223. At a self-serve station, while there may be a roadside sign directing motorists to fill up their own tanks and the owner or attendants may not be present at the station, there is \"no doubt that the owner is in the business of distributing, transferring or dispersing gasoline.\" Id. at 1223-24. Much like the gas station owner, the defendant in Shaffer \"welcomed people to his computer and was happy to let them take child pornography from it.\" Id. at 1224. Thus, just as the owner of a self-serve gas station \"distributes\" gasoline, one who shares files on a peer-to-peer network \"distributes\" those files. See id.\n\nShaffer and the other cases cited above analyzed the term \"distribution,\" but in the context of peer-to-peer file sharing, there is no significant difference between \"distribution\" and \"dissemination.\" \"Distribute\" means, among other things, to spread out; to scatter; to give or deliver, especially to members of a group. Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 368 (1987). \"Dissemination\" means to spread; to disperse throughout. Id. at 366. Because the terms \"distribute\" and \"dissemination\" have similar meanings, the cases holding that peer-to-peer file sharing is \"distribution\" persuasively answer the question of whether the same activity constitutes \"dissemination.\" Mindful that penal code section 43.25(a) defines \"promote\" to mean both \"distribute\" and \"disseminate,\" we hold that making digital files available to others through peer-to-peer file sharing software like Shareaza is \"dissemination\" within the meaning of section 43.25(a).\n\nThe jury heard ample evidence regarding Appellant's dissemination of the child pornography files to Sergeant Ried on November 28, 2005. Sergeant Ried and Detective Lawrence both testified about how their investigations resulted in finding child pornography files stored in subfolders within Appellant's \"Shared\" folder on his computer. Sergeant Ried explained his process of searching for child pornography on Shareaza and described how he retrieved the indicted files from Appellant's computer by downloading them to his computer in Austin. Detective Lawrence confirmed that, in February 2006, his forensic investigation revealed that Appellant's seized computer contained the same files and user-created subfolders discovered by Sergeant Ried's November investigation. Thus, the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to prove that Appellant actually disseminated child pornography. See Sewell, 513 F.3d at 822; Carani, 492 F.3d at 876; Shaffer, 472 F.3d at 1223.\n\n2. Intentional or knowing dissemination\n\nNext, Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence to prove he intentionally or knowingly disseminated the files in question. Appellant highlights the *200 testimony that under Shareaza's default settings, the program will share a user's downloaded files automatically. Although Detective Lawrence testified that Appellant had changed the default settings sometime before the State seized his computer so that Appellant had to manually move downloaded files from the \"downloads\" folder to the \"Shared\" folder before Shareaza would share them with other users, he was unable to testify that Appellant had so modified the default settings before Detective Ried downloaded the indicted files from Appellant's computer three months earlier. And State's Exhibit 11\u2014the screen captures Detective Ried made when he downloaded the files\u2014indicates that Appellant's shared files were in the default \"downloads\" folder, not a separate \"Shared\" folder. Thus, argues Appellant, there is no evidence that he intentionally or knowingly disseminated child pornography because Shareaza automatically shared his downloaded files with other users, including Detective Ried.\n\nBut other evidence tends to show that Appellant intentionally or knowingly shared his downloaded files. Most significantly, in his recorded interview, Appellant admitted that he knew Shareaza shared his files: he said that he assumed users downloaded files from him and that the purpose of Shareaza was to allow users (like Detective Ried) to \"pull files from members\" (like Appellant). Although Appellant claimed in the interview that he did not know \"how to not share and share and separate those items out,\" Detective Lawrence's testimony shows that Appellant did at some point\u2014before the State seized his computer and before the interview\u2014 change the default Shareaza settings so that the program did not automatically share Appellant's downloaded files. This shows that\u2014contrary to his claim in the recorded interview\u2014Appellant did know how to \"not share and share\" files. Detective Lawrence also explained why a Shareaza user like Appellant might want to share files, namely, because Shareaza rewards a user for allowing others to download files from his computers: \"[T]he more files you share, the faster you can download other files.\"\n\nA jury could reasonably infer from this evidence that Appellant knew Shareaza was sharing his downloaded files and knew how to prevent Shareaza from sharing his downloaded files. Thus, the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to show that Appellant intentionally or knowingly disseminated the indicted files despite his argument that Shareaza shared the files automatically and without his knowledge or intent.\n\n3. Knowledge of the actual content of files\n\nFinally, Appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to show that he knew the files in question contained child pornography when Sergeant Ried downloaded them.\n\nThere is no direct evidence that Appellant viewed the files in question before Sergeant Ried downloaded them from Appellant's computer; both Sergeant Ried and Detective Lawrence admitted that they had no such proof. But Appellant said in his recorded interview that he \"tried\" to view everything he downloaded. Sergeant Ried testified that Shareaza allows a user to \"preview\" files even before the download is complete. Appellant admitted that he searched for and downloaded child pornography by inputting search terms like \"young\" and \"Lolita\" (he denied that \"Lolita\" yielded any \"matches,\" but one of the indicted images has the term \"Lolita\" in its file name). He manually organized his child-pornography collection in folders with names like \"young.\" It *201 appears from State's Exhibit 11 that the \"young\" folder existed on Appellant's computer when Sergeant Ried downloaded the indicted files, and Detective Lawrence testified that he found those same files in the \"young\" folder on Appellant's computer.\n\nMost telling are the explicitly descriptive names of the indicted files themselves, which included the terms \"age6-3,\" \"kiddy\", \"child abuse,\" \"underage,\" \"rape,\" \"molest\", \"p-e-d-o,\" \"Lolita,\" \"PTHC\" (Pre-Teen Hard Core), \"8 9 10 11 12 yo,\" \"6 year old,\" and \"baby incest.\" Detective Lawrence testified that he knew what the files depicted from the file names alone before he viewed them. There was testimony that descriptive file names can be inaccurate or misleading, but in his recorded interview, Appellant volunteered that sometimes, the names are accurate: \"[I]t says, `young teens,' and you pull it up, and it's a 35-year-old woman ... but some of the stuff does come up that ... is real.\" The record shows that the descriptive file names of the indicted files were indeed accurate. Finally, the record shows that Appellant deliberately selected the descriptively-named files for downloading; as Detective Ried explained, Shareaza does not randomly download files.\n\nFrom Appellant's admission that he \"tried\" to view everything he downloaded, from the fact that he organized the indicted files in a folder labeled \"young,\" and from the descriptive names of the files, a jury could reasonably infer that Appellant knew the indicted files depicted child pornography when he disseminated them to Sergeant Ried, despite the lack of direct evidence that Appellant actually viewed the files' contents before that date.\n\ne. Conclusion\n\nViewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational jury could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that Appellant actually disseminated the images, (2) that he acted intentionally and knowingly, and (3) that he knew that the computer images in question depicted children under 18 years of age engaging in sexual conduct. We hold that the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury's verdict. See Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789; Clayton, 235 S.W.3d at 778.\n\nViewing the evidence in a neutral light, we cannot say that the evidence is so weak that the jury's determination that Appellant intentionally or knowingly disseminated child pornography is clearly wrong or manifestly unjust. We also cannot say that conflicting evidence greatly outweighs evidence supporting conviction so that the jury's determination is manifestly unjust. See Lancon, 253 S.W.3d at 704; Watson, 204 S.W.3d at 414-15, 417. We therefore hold that the evidence is factually sufficient to support the jury's verdict, and we overrule Appellant's first point.\n\nIV. Admission of hearsay testimony\n\nIn his second point, Appellant argues that the testimony identifying his IP address and Internet service provider constituted hearsay and should not have been admitted because it was an out-of-court computer-stored statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Appellant objected to Sergeant Ried's initial statements regarding the IP address but did not obtain a running objection. Further, toward the end of Sergeant Ried's testimony and when Detective Lawrence testified, Appellant did not object when the State elicited additional IP address testimony. Sergeant Ried confirmed without objection the existence of the IP address when describing Exhibit 11 and testified that the address was assigned to Appellant. Detective Lawrence recited the numbers in the IP address without any objection and stated that it came from Appellant's computer *202 and matched the submitted IP address from the Attorney General's office.\n\nTo preserve a complaint for our review, a party must have presented to the trial court a timely request, objection, or motion that states the specific grounds for the desired ruling if they are not apparent from the context of the request, objection, or motion. Tex.R.App. P. 33.1(a)(1); Mosley v. State, 983 S.W.2d 249, 265 (Tex. Crim.App.1998) (op. on reh'g), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1070, 119 S. Ct. 1466, 143 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1999). A party must continue to object each time the objectionable evidence is offered. Fuentes v. State, 991 S.W.2d 267, 273 (Tex.Crim.App.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1026, 120 S. Ct. 541,  145 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1999); Ethington v. State, 819 S.W.2d 854, 858-59 (Tex.Crim.App.1991). A trial court's erroneous admission of evidence will not require reversal when other such evidence was received without objection, either before or after the complained-of ruling. Leday v. State, 983 S.W.2d 713, 718 (Tex.Crim.App.1998); Johnson v. State, 803 S.W.2d 272, 291 (Tex.Crim.App. 1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1259, 111 S. Ct. 2914,  115 L. Ed. 2d 1078 (1991), overruled on other grounds by Heitman v. State, 815 S.W.2d 681 (Tex.Crim.App.1991). This rule applies whether the other evidence was introduced by the defendant or the State. Leday, 983 S.W.2d at 718.\n\nBecause Appellant did not obtain a running objection for his hearsay objection during Ried's testimony or specifically object to the IP address testimony elicited from Detective Lawrence, he did not preserve error for our review. Fuentes, 991 S.W.2d at 273. We must therefore overrule Appellant's second point.\n\nV. Evidence of Extraneous Offenses\n\nIn his third point, Appellant argues that the trial court's admission of the exhibit showing a list of subfolders and 900 file names from his \"Shared\" folder of Shareaza in addition to the files with which he was charged was improper because it included both adult as well as child pornography, thus constituting improper extraneous offense evidence that was unduly prejudicial under Texas Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b). The State argues that because Appellant admitted his guilt at punishment, he is estopped from raising this point unless he can show that admission of this evidence implicated a fundamental right.[8] Because we hold the evidence was admissible and not unduly prejudicial, we need not address this contention.\n\nWe review a trial court's evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion. Weatherred v. State, 15 S.W.3d 540, 542 (Tex.Crim. App.2000); Montgomery v. State, 810 S.W.2d 372, 391 (Tex.Crim.App.1991) (op. on reh'g). A trial court abuses its discretion only when the decision lies outside the zone of reasonable disagreement. Green v. State, 934 S.W.2d 92, 101-02 (Tex.Crim. App.1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1200, 117 S. Ct. 1561, 137 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1997). The trial court has wide latitude to admit or exclude evidence of extraneous offenses. Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 390; Sanders v. State, 255 S.W.3d 754, 760 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2008, pet. ref'd.). We give great discretion to the trial court in matters of admissibility of evidence if correct *203 under any theory of law, even if the trial court's underlying reason was wrong. See Romero v. State, 800 S.W.2d 539, 543-45 (Tex.Crim.App.1990).\n\nTexas Rule of Evidence 404(b) prohibits admission of evidence of extraneous offenses to prove that, on the occasion in question, the defendant acted in conformity with the character shown by other bad acts. Tex.R. Evid. 404(b); see Santellan v. State, 939 S.W.2d 155, 168 (Tex. Crim.App.1997); Jones v. State, 119 S.W.3d 412, 418 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2003, no pet.). However, evidence offered to prove motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, intent, or absence of mistake or accident is not barred by Rule 404(b). Santellan, 939 S.W.2d at 168. When the defendant objects under Rule 404(b), the State must satisfy the trial court that the extraneous offense has relevance apart from its character-conformity value. See Rankin v. State, 974 S.W.2d 707, 718 (Tex.Crim.App.1998) (op. on reh'g); Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 387.\n\nAn extraneous offense has noncharacter-conformity relevance when it has any tendency to make the existence of a fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. See Tex.R. Evid. 401; Powell v. State, 63 S.W.3d 435, 438 (Tex.Crim.App.2001). Extraneous offense evidence that tends to rebut a defensive theory is relevant beyond its character-conformity value. Bass v. State, 270 S.W.3d 557, 563 (Tex.Crim. App.2008); Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 386-87; Jones, 119 S.W.3d at 419. The State argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the list of subfolders and file names because it was admissible to rebut Appellant's defensive theory, to show his knowledge and intent to possess and promote the indicted images and his plan to store and share those images, and to show that his possession and promotion of those images was not a result of accident or mistake.\n\nAppellant's defensive theory that he sought to develop on cross-examination of the officers was that, if any child pornography was downloaded onto his computer, it must have been accidental, and that it may have been shared with others before he viewed the content and without his knowledge. On cross-examination of Sergeant Ried, Appellant created an impression that he had only one file available for downloading and that that file could have been downloaded by others and \"shared\" before he became aware of it. The State's exhibit showing an extensive list of subfolders and file names tended to show that Appellant was experienced in searching for both child and adult pornography, that he had numerous files of both kinds available for sharing, and that he organized his pornography collection by type of image, including creating a special subfolder entitled \"young.\" His creation\u2014or retention\u2014of the highly descriptive as well as offensive and lurid file names, along with their organization, not only made them easily searchable by other users but was also relevant to show that he was aware of the illegal nature of his conduct and that the presence of the indicted images on his computer was not accidental. The evidence was relevant to the issues of motive, intent, plan, knowledge, and lack of mistake or accident. We agree with the State that the exhibit had relevance apart from evidence of character-conformity. See Tex.R. Evid. 404(b).\n\nEvidence relevant under Rule 404(b) may nevertheless be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury or by undue delay or needless presentation of *204 cumulative evidence. Tex.R. Evid. 403. \"Probative value\" refers to the inherent probative force of an item of evidence\u2014 that is, how strongly it serves to make more or less probable the existence of a fact of consequence to the litigation\u2014coupled with the proponent's need for that evidence. Gigliobianco v. State, 210 S.W.3d 637, 641 (Tex.Crim.App.2006). \"Unfair prejudice\" refers to a tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly although not necessarily an emotional one. Id. Only unfair prejudice provides the basis for exclusion of relevant evidence. Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 389.\n\nThe relevant criteria in performing a rule 403 balancing test include (1) the inherent probative force of the proffered item of evidence along with (2) the proponent's need for that evidence, balanced against (3) any tendency of the evidence to suggest conviction on an improper basis, (4) any tendency of the evidence to confuse or distract the jury from the main issues, (5) any tendency of the evidence to be given undue weight by a jury that is not equipped to evaluate the probative force of the evidence, and (6) the likelihood that presentation of the evidence will consume an inordinate amount of time or merely repeat evidence already admitted. Gigliobianco, 210 S.W.3d at 641-42.\n\nWe presume that the probative value substantially outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice. Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 389. It is therefore the defendant's burden to demonstrate that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value. Hinojosa v. State, 995 S.W.2d 955, 958 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, no pet.); Poole v. State, 974 S.W.2d 892, 897 (Tex.App.-Austin 1998, pet. ref'd). It is not incumbent on the trial court to perform the balancing test on the record. Yates v. State, 941 S.W.2d 357, 367 (Tex.App.-Waco 1997, pet. ref'd). In reviewing the trial court's balancing test determination, we are to reverse the trial court's judgment \"rarely and only after a clear abuse of discretion.\" Mozon v. State, 991 S.W.2d 841, 847 (Tex.Crim.App.1999).\n\nAs discussed above, the first two factors weigh in favor of admitting the extraneous offense evidence. The evidence was probative to rebut Appellant's defensive theory that he did not intentionally or knowingly possess or promote the indicted images; many of the images listed in the State's exhibit 11, like the indicted images, contain labels including terms such as \"teen,\" \"child,\" and \"kiddy\" and make it more likely that he was fully aware of the specific nature of the material that he downloaded. The evidence was needed by the State to show that Appellant organized, stored, and shared the downloaded images as described by their titles and that his doing so was not the result of mistake or accident.\n\nThe third, fourth, and fifth criteria of the balancing test do not weigh heavily in favor of exclusion. In contrast to the items with which Appellant was charged with possessing and promoting, the exhibit of which he complains consists only of a list of written titles; the corresponding images were never shown to the jury. Hence, the exhibit did not have a definite tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, to unduly confuse or distract the jury from the main issues regarding the indicted images, or to invite the jury to give undue weight to that evidence. Moreover, presentation of the evidence did not consume an inordinate amount of time nor merely repeat evidence already admitted.\n\nAppellant complains of the offensive and repulsive nature of the titles shown and points to testimony that some of the titles may have been misleading or incorrect, but he acknowledges that many, if *205 not most, were \"real.\" Moreover, there was evidence that he selected the descriptively-titled files for downloading. Thus, we agree with the State that the exhibit listing the titles was the best and least prejudicial method of rebutting Appellant's defensive theory that he may have downloaded images of child pornography accidentally or shared them without knowledge of their content.\n\nAdditionally, we note that the jury charge contains a proper reasonable doubt instruction. The jury was instructed not to consider evidence of Appellant's commission of any crimes, wrongs, or acts other than the offenses alleged in the indictment unless it found such commission beyond a reasonable doubt. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the State's exhibit because the probative value of that evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice. We overrule Appellant's third point.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nHaving overruled Appellant's three points, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] Sergeant Ried defined \"peer-to-peer\" in this context as a \"computer to computer connection,\" and as Detective Lawrence later explained, there is \"no central location\"; rather, a file is \"shared amongst all the computers hooked up to the network at that time.\"\n\n[2] An IP address is a unique 32-bit-long code number that each computer acquires automatically through its Internet access provider for connecting to the Internet. http://www. businessdictionary.com/definition/IP-address. html (last visited June 17, 2009).\n\n[3] Sergeant Ried downloaded three files from Appellant's IP address: one file containing actual sexual intercourse, one file containing actual lewd exhibition of female genitals, and one file containing actual sexual conduct.\n\n[4] Miranda v.

Gerstein; and Jennifer L. Lynch for Plaintiffs and Respondents.\n\nOPINION\n\nMALLANO, P. J.\u2014\n\nA 15-year-old high school student was pursuing a career in entertainment and maintained a Web site for that purpose. Several of his fellow students posted messages at the Web site, making derogatory comments about his perceived sexual orientation and threatening him with bodily harm.\n\nThe aggrieved student and his parents filed this action against the other students and their parents, alleging a statutory claim under California's hate crimes laws (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 51.7, 52.1) and common law claims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In response, one of the student-defendants and his parents filed a special motion to strike, contending that the action was a \"strategic lawsuit against public participation\" (SLAPP) (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16; all undesignated section references are to that code unless otherwise indicated). The student-defendant had posted a message stating in part: \". . . I want to rip out your fucking heart and feed it to you. . . . I've . . . wanted to kill you. If I ever see you I'm . . . going to pound your head in with an ice pick. Fuck you, you dick-riding penis lover. I hope you burn in hell.\" The trial court denied the anti-SLAPP motion on the ground that the lawsuit did not arise out of a statement made in connection with a \"public issue.\" (\u00a7 425.16, subds. (b)(1), (e)(3).) Defendants appealed.\n\nWe affirm because defendants did not make the requisite showing that plaintiffs' complaint is subject to the anti-SLAPP statute. In particular, defendants did not demonstrate that the posted message is protected speech. Further, defendants contend the message was intended as \"jocular humor.\" Assuming the message was a \"joke\"\u2014played by one teenager on another\u2014 it does not concern a \"public issue\" under the statute. (See \u00a7 425.16, subds. (b)(1), (e)(3).)\n\nI\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe following allegations and evidence are taken from the pleadings and the papers submitted in the trial court with respect to the anti-SLAPP motion.\n\n*1200 D.C., the student-plaintiff, attended Harvard-Westlake School (Harvard-Westlake), a private educational institution in Los Angeles. D.C. filed this action against several other students through a guardian ad litem, his father. D.C.'s father and mother also pleaded claims in their own right. (We will refer to D.C. and his parents collectively as plaintiffs.) Plaintiffs also named as defendants the parents of each student-defendant; the parents were sued as guardians ad litem and individually for their child's conduct (see Civ. Code, \u00a7 1714.1). (We refer to the student-defendants and their parents collectively as defendants.) Harvard-Westlake, its board of directors, and three school employees were also sued. The claims against them were arbitrated pursuant to an arbitration provision in the school's enrollment contract. (See D.C. v. Harvard-Westlake School (2009) 176 Cal. App. 4th 836 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 300].)\n\nA. Complaint\n\nPlaintiffs commenced this action on April 25, 2005. A first amended complaint (complaint) was filed on June 8, 2005, and alleged as follows.\n\nWhile a student, D.C. pursued a career as a singer and an actor. He had a record album with a planned release date, had broadcast a song worldwide via satellite radio, and had played the leading role in a feature film presented at an internationally acclaimed film festival. He had also toured under the auspices of a nationally recognized radio network.\n\nD.C. maintained a Web site to promote his entertainment career. The site allowed any member of the public to post comments in a \"guestbook.\" Several students at Harvard-Westlake went to the Web site and posted threats against D.C. and made derogatory comments about him. One post read, \"Faggot, I'm going to kill you.\" Another read, \"[You need] a quick and painless death.\" One student wrote, \"Fuck you in your fucking fuck hole.\" Another commented, \"Fucking ass clown. Nigga what?\" One post announced, \"You are now officially wanted dead or alive.\" Another threatened, \"I will personally unleash my manseed in those golden brown eyes.\"\n\nThe students who posted the threats sought to destroy D.C.'s life, threatened to murder him, and wanted to drive him out of Harvard-Westlake and the community in which he lived. They were motivated by a misperception of D.C.'s sexual orientation. When D.C.'s father read the threats at the Web site, he immediately informed Harvard-Westlake of the problem, believing that some of its students were responsible. The father also contacted the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which, in turn, notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\n*1201 On the advice of the police, D.C. withdrew from Harvard-Westlake. He and his family moved to Northern California, where he went to a different educational institution. The Harvard-Westlake student newspaper, The Chronicle, ran at least two articles on the matter. One article disclosed D.C.'s new residential location and the name of the school he was attending. The article also disclosed that posts at the Web site had referred to D.C. as a \"faggot.\" Harvard-Westlake did not suspend or expel any of the students who admitted posting the threats.\n\nAs a consequence of defendants' conduct, plaintiffs suffered personal and emotional injury, loss of income, the payment of medical expenses, the cost of moving, expenses for traveling back and forth from their new residential location to Los Angeles in order to support D.C.'s professional career commitments, and the related cost of housing while staying in Los Angeles.\n\nThe complaint contained five causes of action against defendants, only three of which are relevant here. First, plaintiffs alleged that defendants had violated their right under the state hate crimes laws to be free from \"threat[s] of violence\" motivated by perceived sexual orientation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 51.7, subd. (a); see id., 52.1.)[1] Second, in a defamation claim, plaintiffs asserted that defendants had libeled D.C. by calling him a homosexual. Third, plaintiffs alleged a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, contending that defendants' conduct was outrageous and had caused plaintiffs to suffer severe emotional distress. All three of these causes of action were based on the posted threats and their effect on plaintiffs.\n\nPlaintiffs named as defendants six students and their parents. Among those sued were R.R., a student, and his parents (collectively the R.'s).\n\nB. Anti-SLAPP Motion\n\nOn July 20, 2005, the R.'s filed an anti-SLAPP motion, contending that R.R.'s posted message was protected speech or, more specifically, a written statement or writing made in a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest. (See \u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(3).) The motion was supported by several declarations, including ones from R.R. and his father. In opposing the motion, plaintiffs relied primarily on a declaration from D.C.'s father. Both sides submitted declarations from law enforcement personnel.\n\nR.R. posted the following message on D.C.'s Web site: \"Hey [D.C.], I want to rip out your fucking heart and feed it to you. I heard your song while *1202 driving my kid to school and from that moment on I've . . . wanted to kill you. If I ever see you I'm . . . going to pound your head in with an ice pick. Fuck you, you dick-riding penis lover. I hope you burn in hell.\"\n\nPosts by other students included: (1) \"I hate fags. . . . diefags@ yahoo.com. . . . gays are evil.com. . . . Hey fucker. . . . You are real gay\"; (2) \"Faggot, I'm going to kill you\"; (3) \"You are an oversized faggot. . . . I just want to hit you in the neck\u2014hard. . . . [G]o to the 405 [freeway] bridge and jump\"; (4) \"I hate fags. . . . You need to be stopped\"; (5) \"I am looking forward to your death\"; and (6) \"Not only are you a massive fagmo, but must absolutely quit showing your face at my school. You are now officially wanted dead or alive.\"\n\n1. Declaration of D.C.'s Father\n\nBy way of background, D.C.'s father explained: \"[D.C.], without exception, uses the pseudonym `Danny Alexander' in his entertainment career.\n\n\". . . Nowhere on the subject website . . . nor in any publicity material, album packaging, or on film credits has [D.C.] been identified by his legal name.\n\n\". . . Like many other aspiring entertainers, [D.C.] deliberately chose to use a stage name precisely so he could enjoy a `dual life,' one which afforded him the luxury of anonymity outside the entertainment industry. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\". . . Of the thirty-four (34) outrageously offensive original postings made on [D.C.'s Web site] that are the subject of this lawsuit, twenty-three (23) falsely identify [D.C.] as a homosexual.\n\n\". . . I am informed, believe, and thereon allege that those twenty-three (23) postings regarding sexual preference originated from no less than ten (10) distinct computer systems.\n\n\". . . The website . . . was permanently removed from the Internet. . . the same day the postings were discovered. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\". . . The LAPD disagreed with [a school administrator's] `intuition' that the school posed no danger to [D.C.] and therefore advised me to have [D.C.] stay home from school until a thorough investigation had been completed. [D.C.] did attend a PSAT exam at the school with great trepidation and only after I discussed the matter with the administration and stayed on site to watch him throughout the testing without causing any disturbance to students sitting for the college entrance examination. Other than that one examination, *1203 [D.C.] did not return to the school due to fear for his life. If the threats were nullified, it would have been our preference to have him continue to attend Harvard-Westlake and remain in Beverly Hills.\n\n\". . . We waited . . . for an outcome to the investigation through the school and the authorities, but without obtaining the information necessary to insure our son's safety we were compelled to enroll [D.C.] . . . at another school in order to salvage what was left of his first semester of his critical junior year. Despite this enrollment we would have sought to have him return if we had been assured that he was safe from the vicious threats of violence and taunting as shown in the posts. I had to commute to Los Angeles from [Northern California] during the week and be away from my family which was incredibly stressful for the entire family and caused additional stress on . . . my wife over the concern for [D.C.] and his safety while I was gone.\n\n\". . . Of the thirty-four (34) offensive postings originally posted, six (6) were perceived [as] death threats by me and my family. These included the one[] admitted to by [R.R.] . . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\". . . [R.R.'s message] in particular was the most evil and malicious of the postings and looked to come from a parent rather than a student. My family was terrified and made physically nauseous from the threat. We feared for the life of our fifteen year old child. The fact that others wanted to `one-up' each other as [R.R.] asserts in his declaration furthers our belief that the boys worked in concert to terrify my family like a gang of thugs driving us to pull our son from school and move. There was nothing `playful' in the post, and the fact that [R.R.] still believes this is alarming and renews our concerns for persons that offend him by sexual orientation or otherwise. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\". . . Because [D.C.] was uprooted mid-semester in his junior year of high school, and because of the threat of death, its impact on his family, and continued stress, his school life and career were adversely affected. Further, due to the threats and gay vulgar lies posted [D.C.] started to suffer from frequent and severe panic attacks which required medical attention, and from which he still suffers occasionally to this date. For the first time in his life after the postings people approached [D.C.] to discuss what was posted and asked him about being gay. It was clear that others that read the posts believed the comments about his sexual orientation and felt concern for him and his safety. This also added to [D.C.'s] embarrassment and to his distress.\n\n\". . . [O]ur family suffered: emotional distress; anxiety; sleeplessness; physical pain; insecurity; fear; pain and suffering; payment of attorneys' fees; payment of medical expenses; payment of moving expenses; payment of *1204 traveling and housing expenses to and from Los Angeles to support our business endeavors; [and] [D.C.]'s lost income . . . .\n\n\". . . [D.C.] suffered poor academic performance during his junior year, which compelled our family to hire a tutor and education therapist, and which ultimately resulted in his continued suffering from emotional distress and anxiety, and adversely affecting his self-esteem, school life and earning potential. In fact, the movie `Steal Me' [(Cineville & Picture Entertainment Corp. 2005)] in which [D.C.] had the lead was not released to the public until well after the malicious postings had occurred.\n\n\"The LAPD advised my family that [D.C.] should not return to school at [Harvard-Westlake] until a thorough investigation had been completed.\"\n\n2. R.R.'s Declaration\n\nR.R. explained at length why he posted the message: \"Prior to my sending of an email posting to [D.C.] . . ., I had no relationship with [him], and, . . . to my knowledge, I had seen him at Harvard Westlake from a distance on several occasions, walking through the halls, but never had verbal or physical contact with him. Prior to the email incident . . ., I attended a PSAT preparatory session which was attended by approximately seven students. I knew [D.C.] was one of these students. We did not interact with each other in any manner during this PSAT session. I had not met [D.C.] before that session; we had never been in the same class; and, to my knowledge, we never participated in the same school activities. Moreover, I had not heard anything about him. I had no knowledge of his acting or singing involvement, did not know his interests or habits, and was unaware of who his friends were at school. Prior to the . . . email incident, I had no opinion about [D.C.] whatsoever. I did not like or dislike him and certainly had no views about his gender identity, sexual orientation, or skills as a singer or actor. Likewise, I had never heard any fellow student convey any opinion about him generally, or with regards to any aspect of his life, including his sexual orientation. I certainly did not harbor any ill will against him or his family, and, in fact, the only reason I knew his name is that our school is very small and I know the name of almost every student in my class. . . .\n\n\". . . Sometime after I first saw [D.C.] at the PSAT session . . ., while I was at Harvard Westlake School, a fellow student suggested that I should `check out' the website of a fellow student, i.e. [D.C.] The student did not tell me the content of the website; did not ask me to post any messages on the website; did not tell me that he was going to post any messages on the website; and did not give me any information about [D.C.] My fellow student, did, however, suggest I look at the site in a tone of voice suggesting *1205 that there was something weird, strange, or far out about the website. My fellow student did not invite me to participate in any `conspiracy' and made no suggestion that I do anything but just take a look at the site.\n\n\". . . After that school day, I returned home at my regular time. When I turned on my computer, I received an instant message from the fellow student providing me with an Internet link to the [D.C.] website. The instant message did not suggest that I post messages, or provide any suggestions about how I should respond to the website. In fact, at the time I received this message I was completely unaware that the site provided for the posting of messages. . . .\n\n\". . . Almost immediately after receiving the instant message, I used the link to see [D.C.'s] website because I was curious about what the interest was in the website. When I first entered [D.C.'s] website, I was greeted by a picture of him with music and singing playing in the background. When I surveyed the site with its links, it immediately revealed more pictures, that were very posed, and a biography of [D.C.'s] alleged accomplishments. In the site, [D.C.] describes himself in the way products are advertised. He described his eyes as `Golden Brown.' He describes his hair as `Midnight Brown.'. . . After listing his accomplishments, he is pictured with a shirt that prominently displays the word `SUCCESSFUL.' The site then links the viewer to [D.C.'s] fan mail which to this day includes obsequious fan messages that appear calculated to give the impression that [D.C.] is a person of extraordinary fame and talent. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\"The messages refer to [D.C.] as `Danny Alexander' because the website itself uses a pseudo name rather than his real name, making it unclear as to whether the whole site is a spoof.\n\n\". . . My initial response to the site was to be offended and put off by its `I am better than you' attitude and its blatant bragging and self promotion. In the past, I had spent time studying Buddhism, and in light of the Buddhist tradition of quiet understatement, the website's distinctly narcissistic tone was disturbing. On the other hand, I was a bit entertained by [the] weird, possibly satirical, tone of the site. I certainly appreciated why a fellow student would want me to `check this out.'\n\n\". . . [D.C.'s] website also had a link that allowed a viewer to post public messages and to view the posting made to the website. The website invited postings. The postings included messages from admirers writing as if he were a famous movie star and singer. [D.C.] portrayed himself as a public figure. I then began looking at the posted messages. There were many messages, apparently from fellow students, that were hostile and derogatory, albeit jesting. I did not know the identity of the posting persons. I did, however, *1206 suspect that at least some of the messages were from Harvard Westlake students because the messages referred to Harvard Westlake.\n\n\". . . I sensed that the other writers had a similar emotional response to the site that I had. As these postings became increasingly bizarre and weird, it became apparent to me that everyone was competing to see who could be the most outrageous. For example, one poster suggested that he was an `official' representative of the student body and that [D.C.] was wanted dead or alive. I thought the postings were funny, and I certainly didn't think that [D.C.], or any other rational person, would believe that he was wanted dead or alive. Likewise, another posting referred to [D.C.] as a `Nigga.' Of course, [D.C.] was obviously not a black American. Yet another posting referred to the poster's wish to `unleash my manseed in those golden brown eyes.' This appeared to be an obvious satire of [D.C.'s] own self description as the wonder boy with `golden brown' eyes.\n\n\". . . That afternoon, I was in a playful mood and I decided to add my own message to the Internet graffiti contest that was apparently going on. I posted a message which stated: `Hey [D.C.], I want to rip out your fucking heart and feed it to you. I heard your song while driving my kid to school and from that moment on I've . . . wanted to kill you. If I ever see you I'm . . . going to pound your head in with an ice pick. Fuck you, you dick-riding penis lover. I hope you burn in hell.'\n\n\". . . My motivations in sending this email had nothing to do with any perception of [D.C.'s] sexual orientation, and certainly did not reflect an intention to do him physical harm. As set forth above, I had no personal knowledge or belief about [D.C.'s] sexual orientation. No one ever told me he was gay, and I had no thoughts on the subject matter. My message is fanciful, hyperbolic, jocular, and taunting and was motivated by [D.C.'s] pompous, self aggrandizing, and narcissistic website\u2014not his sexual orientation. My only other motivation, a bit more pathological, was to win the one-upmanship contest that was tacitly taking place between the message posters. Everything about the message is fanciful. I assumed that any rational person would understand that I was just inarticulately and offensively saying, `I am repulsed by your self promotional style.' I certainly did not think anyone would believe that they could eat their own heart after it was taken from their body. I assumed that a 10 year old child would understand that you would be dead if your heart was removed. I obviously didn't have school age children and I had never listened to any of [D.C.'s] songs. Paradoxically, my message states that my motivation was a hatred of [D.C.'s] song, not his sexual orientation, i.e., my message itself . . . belies the allegation in the complaint.\n\n*1207 \". . . The complaint alleges that my motivation was my perception that [D.C.'s] sexual orientation was gay. As set forth above, I had no opinion regarding [D.C.'s] sexual orientation. More importantly, I wouldn't care less if he was gay. I have no animosity towards gays, and . . . even if I thought [D.C.] was gay, it couldn't be a basis for any hatred or threat. . . . [O]ne of my favorite relatives is openly homosexual and I have been quite vociferous in defending this relative from fundamentalist views that characterize homosexuality as a disease. In fact, one [of] my good friends at school is a member of the Gay-Straight Alliance. I have made my views clear that I think this student's involvement is `cool.' Likewise, I have walked side by side with gay couples in the AIDS walk, supporting their position, and I have worked through a church at a soup kitchen for AIDS patients, many of whom are gay. . . . I am not homophobic and the basis of my conduct was childishness and some repulsion to [D.C.'s] grandiose style\u2014not his sexual orientation.\n\n\". . . The next day after the offensive postings, at school, I heard students talking about the posts. The students expressed the view that the posts were a funny gag. No one took the posts seriously as a death threat or an accusation of homosexuality. The posts were treated as a goof. I did not participate in these conversations because I was ashamed of my participation. In retrospect, my conduct felt infantile, immature, and was beneath me. I felt ashamed that I would allow the desire for peer approval, `peer pressure,' to induce me into acting like an idiot.\n\n\". . . Shortly after sending these messages, I again saw [D.C.] at the PSAT preparation class. He was not acting as if he were afraid that he was going to be killed. He appeared calm and participated in exactly the same manner as the preparation session before the Internet graffiti contest. We did not interact at all. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\". . . I wrote a letter of apology to [D.C.] and his family. The school provided me with the address of [D.C.'s] father and I sent the letter to that address. In that letter, I admit my email transmission and state: `I want you to know that I never intended to harm you or your family, and that I respect your career and what you are trying to do with your life.' At the end of that letter I stated: `If there is anything else I can do to atone for my actions, please let me know.' I never received a response to this letter. After sending this letter to [D.C.], I sent a copy to the Harvard Westlake School . . . .\"\n\n3. Declaration of R.R.'s Father\n\nR.R.'s father stated in part: \"My son [R.R.] is 17 years old. Approximately two years ago, I purchased a computer for my son and gave it to him for his personal use as a gift. My son needed a computer to do school research and *1208 to be able to draft papers. Our family considered the computer essential to be able to communicate with teachers and other personnel regarding school work and school related affairs. Sometime shortly after I purchased this home computer, I counseled my son to be careful about being appropriate in his use of the computer. I have learned from my son that he used his home computer to send one of the messages which are referenced in the law suit.\n\n\". . . [R.R.'s] computer is located in his bedroom. I do not have a password to any of his accounts, and . . . my son uses an account for emails different than the one that I use. . . . [T]here is no way for me to know the content of any email sent or received by [my] son unless he happens to tell me. Prior to my son's communication which is the subject of this lawsuit, I was not aware that he sent any messages with accusatory, threatening, or inappropriate content. I never saw any such messages; my son never reported sending such messages; I never received any complaint about any such messages. Contrary to the allegations in the complaint, I never allowed or permitted my son to engage in the conduct alleged. I had no idea that he sent such messages; never suspected he sent such messages; and, because I did not have his password[,] I did not have any ability to read his emails. Had I known that [R.R.] sent this kind of message, I would have counseled him not to do so. I would have offered such counseling, and would have barred his access to the Internet if he did not agree to abstain, because I find the communications offensive\u2014not because they might be technically illegal or subject to civil liability.\n\n\". . . In fact, as soon as my wife . . . and I discovered the conduct alleged in the complaint, we terminated [R.R.'s] access to the Internet, instituted various punishments including grounding, no cell phone use (except for emergencies), [and] no car use and had him evaluated by a psychiatrist in a further effort to insure that such conduct was never repeated and the root cause, if any, was dealt with immediately . . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\". . . Prior to this episode [R.R.] has never been the subject of any criminal complaint or juvenile complaint of any kind. . . . Our family (including [R.R.]) cooperated with the police investigation immediately without asserting our legal right to remain silent. They reported to us their conclusion that they did not regard [R.R.'s] statement as a real threat and did not intend to seek the filing of any kind of criminal case. [R.R.] has not been charged with a crime or any wrongdoing by any law enforcement entity . . . .\n\n\". . . I have never heard [R.R.] make any negative, derogatory, or hostile statements about homosexuals. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\". . . I have observed [R.R.] to be compassionate, well grounded, with many friends. To my knowledge, [R.R.] has never once gotten into a physical *1209 fight with anyone and he has never threatened to hurt anyone. [R.R.] is somewhat introverted and gentle, and he has an artistic fondness for music.. . . [R.R.'s] proclivity to humanistic and non-violent approaches to the human condition has been reflected in his past interest and practice of Buddhism and being a vegetarian.\"\n\n4. Declaration of Another Student\n\nThe R.'s submitted a declaration from another Harvard-Westlake student who described some of the messages posted at D.C.'s Web site. For example, one post read in part: \"You are so fucking orgasmic. I'm wet. . . . Oops I peed my pants. You look exactly like Britney. . . . Your career is bound to go nowhere.\" One student wrote: \"You are the biggest fag in the HW class . . . . [T]hank you though. . . . [T]his will give everyone laughs for a long long time.\" In a second post, the same student said: \"Hey [D.C.], I'm so excited to finally speak to you. We here at KY Jelly . . . wanted to know if [you] would be the spokesperson for our new anal lube. . . . Fucking ass clown. Nigga what?\"\n\n5. Law Enforcement Declarations\n\nThe deputy district attorney assigned to the criminal investigation submitted a declaration on behalf of the R.'s, stating that, based on the evidence, the district attorney's office declined to prosecute any of the students who had posted messages on D.C.'s Web site.\n\nThe police detective conducting the investigation also submitted a declaration in support of the motion, explaining that the LAPD \"determined that [the] annoying and immature Internet communications did not meet the criteria for criminal prosecution.\" In a followup police report, the LAPD \"determined that the emails were an expression of 1st Amendment rights and no crime.\"\n\nPlaintiffs submitted a declaration from an employee in Harvard-Westlake's security department who had previously been an officer with the LAPD for 20 years. In the former officer's opinion, R.R.'s message constituted \"a clear and specific threat of death\" in violation of Penal Code section 653m. That statute provides: \"Every person who, with intent to annoy, . . . makes contact by means of an electronic communication device with another and addresses to . . . the other person any threat to inflict injury to the person . . . is guilty of a misdemeanor.\" (Id., subd. (a).) The former officer stated that the Web site posts \"depict in my opinion a group attempting to antagonize the victim and evidence a group behavior to work in concert together to harass, annoy, and at times threaten with violence and intimidation a boy perceived to be gay. *1210 The fact that many discussed it at school and then were able to read others' comments and add additional posts over a two day period . . . furthers my belief that they worked together to intimidate the victim and his family.\"\n\nC. Trial Court's Ruling\n\nThe anti-SLAPP motion was heard on March 12, 2008, and taken under submission. By minute order dated May 6, 2008, the trial court denied the motion, concluding that the case did not involve a public issue. (See \u00a7 425.16, subds. (b)(1), (e)(3).) The R.'s appealed.\n\nII\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe review de novo the trial court's ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion. (See Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal. 4th 299, 325 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 606, 139 P.3d 2].)\n\nThe R.'s argue that R.R.'s posted message was \"jocular humor\" entitled to First Amendment protection under the anti-SLAPP statute. We disagree for two reasons. First, the R.'s evidence as to whether R.R.'s message was protected speech is self-contradictory. Accordingly, we cannot say they demonstrated that the message is protected speech. Second, assuming that R.R.'s message was a \"joke\" and thus constitutionally protected, it was not a statement made in connection with a \"public issue\" as that term is used in the anti-SLAPP statute. (See \u00a7 425.16, subds. (b)(1), (e)(3).) Rather, it was merely part of a \"joke\" among teenagers.\n\nA. Protected Activity Under the Anti-SLAPP Statute\n\n(1) \"`Litigation which has come to be known as SLAPP is defined by the sociologists who coined the term as \"civil lawsuits . . . that are aimed at preventing citizens from exercising their political rights or punishing those who have done so.\" . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6]\n\n\"`SLAPP suits are brought to obtain an economic advantage over the defendant, not to vindicate a legally cognizable right of the plaintiff. . . . [O]ne of the common characteristics of a SLAPP suit is its lack of merit. . . . But lack of merit is not of concern to the plaintiff because the plaintiff does not expect to succeed in the lawsuit, only to tie up the defendant's resources for a sufficient length of time to accomplish plaintiff's underlying objective.. . . As long as the defendant is forced to devote its time, energy and financial resources to combating the lawsuit its ability to combat the plaintiff *1211 in the political arena is substantially diminished.'\" (Wilbanks v. Wolk (2004) 121 Cal. App. 4th 883, 890-891 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 497], citations omitted.)\n\n(2) Under the anti-SLAPP statute, \"[a] cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or California Constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.\" (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1), italics added.) The statute is to \"be broadly construed to encourage continued participation in free speech and petition activities.\" (Wanland v. Law Offices of Mastagni, Holstedt & Chiurazzi (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 15, 22 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 633]; see \u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).)\n\n\"`The Legislature enacted the . . . statute to protect defendants . . . from interference with the valid exercise of their constitutional rights, particularly the right of freedom of speech and the right to petition the government for the redress of grievances.'\" (Contemporary Services Corp. v. Staff Pro Inc. (2007)  152 Cal. App. 4th 1043, 1052 [61 Cal.Rptr.3d 434].)\n\n1. Free Speech\n\n(3) \"`The First Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.\" The hallmark of the protection of free speech is to allow \"free trade in ideas\"\u2014even ideas that the overwhelming majority of people might find distasteful or discomforting. . . . [T]he First Amendment \"ordinarily\" denies a State \"the power to prohibit dissemination of social, economic and political doctrine which a vast majority of its citizens believes to be false and fraught with evil consequence.\" . . . The First Amendment affords protection to symbolic or expressive conduct as well as to actual speech. . . .\n\n\"`The protections afforded by the First Amendment, however, are not absolute, and we have long recognized that the government may regulate certain categories of expression consistent with the Constitution. . . . The First Amendment permits \"restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas, which are `of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.' \". . .\n\n(4) \"`. . . [A] State may punish those words \"which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\" . . . Furthermore, \"the constitutional guarantees of free speech and *1212 free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\" . . . And the First Amendment also permits a State to ban a \"true threat.\" . . .\n\n\"`\"True threats\" encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals. . . . The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a prohibition on true threats \"protect[s] individuals from the fear of violence\" and \"from the disruption that fear engenders,\" in addition to protecting people \"from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.\" [ . . . Intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.]' Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. [343, 358-360] [155 L.Ed.2d 535, 123 S.Ct. 1536]\n\n(5) \"The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has articulated the rationale underlying the removal of true threats from first amendment protection. `The notion that some expression may be regulated consistent with the first amendment . . . starts with the already familiar proposition that expression has special value only in the context of dialogue: communication in which the participants seek to persuade, or are persuaded; communication which is about changing or maintaining beliefs, or taking or refusing to take action on the basis of one's beliefs . . . . It is not plausible to uphold the right to use words as projectiles where no exchange of views is involved.' . . . Shackelford v. Shirley, 948 F.2d 935, 938 (5th Cir. 1991) . . . .\n\n\"That court further stated that, `[a]s speech strays further from the values of persuasion, dialogue and free exchange of ideas the first amendment was designed to protect, and moves toward threats made with specific intent to perform illegal acts, the state has greater latitude to enact statutes that effectively neutralize verbal expression.' Shackelford v. Shirley, supra, 948 F.2d at 938. Finally, that court concluded that, `as expansive as the first amendment's conception of social and political discourse may be, threats made with specific intent to injure and focused on a particular individual easily fall into that category of speech deserving no first amendment protection.' Id. . . . [W]e must distinguish between true threats, which, because of their lack of communicative value, are not protected by the first amendment, and those statements that seek to communicate a belief or idea, such as political hyperbole or a mere joke, which are protected. . . .\n\n*1213 (6) \"In the context of a threat of physical violence, `[w]hether a particular statement may properly be considered to be a threat is governed by an objective standard\u2014whether a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault. . . . Although a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech . . . this is not a case involving statements with a political message. A true threat, where a reasonable person would foresee that the listener will believe he will be subjected to physical violence upon his person, is unprotected by the first amendment.' . . . Moreover, `[a]lleged threats should be considered in light of their entire factual context, including the surrounding events and reaction of the listeners.' . . .\" (State v. DeLoreto (2003) 265 Conn. 145 [827 A.2d 671, 679-681], citations omitted; accord, Corales v. Bennett (9th Cir. 2009) 567 F.3d 554, 563-564; Smithfield Foods v. United Food and Commercial (E.D.Va. 2008)  585 F. Supp. 2d 789, 804.)\n\nUnder an objective standard, the court's inquiry focuses on whether a reasonable person would foresee that the speaker's or author's statement would be interpreted by the recipient as a serious expression of intent to inflict bodily harm. (See Fogel v. Collins (9th Cir. 2008) 531 F.3d 824, 831; State v. DeLoreto, supra, 827 A.2d at p. 680.) The objective standard is sometimes called the \"reasonable recipient\" standard. (See U.S. v. Parr (7th Cir. 2008) 545 F.3d 491, 499; U.S. v. Fulmer (1st Cir. 1997) 108 F.3d 1486, 1491.) Some courts, however, apply a subjective standard. Under that approach, a true threat requires proof that the speaker or author intended the speech as a threat of bodily harm. (See Fogel v. Collins, supra, 531 F.3d at pp. 831-833; U.S. v. Parr, supra, 545 F.3d at pp. 498-502.) \"[T]he true threat determination is informed by but not limited to what the recipient or target of the alleged threat knew about the defendant. Contextual information\u2014 especially aspects of a defendant's background that have a bearing on whether his statements might reasonably be interpreted as a threat\u2014is relevant and potentially admissible regardless of whether the recipient or targeted victim had full access to that information.\" (U.S. v. Parr, supra, 545 F.3d at p. 502.) The subjective standard may appropriately be called the \"actual intent\" standard. (See U.S. v. Patillo (4th Cir. 1970)  431 F.2d 293, 298, affd. on rehg. en banc (4th Cir. 1971) 438 F.2d 13; U.S. v. Ogren (C.A.A.F. 2001) 54 M.J. 481, 486.)\n\nFederal courts are divided on whether the applicable standard should be objective or subjective. (See U.S. v. Parr, supra, 545 F.3d at pp. 498-500 & fn. 2; State v. Johnston (2006) 156 Wash. 2d 355, fn. 5 [127 P.3d 707, 710].) This split of authority is attributable to the Supreme Court's decision in Virginia v. Black, supra, 538 U.S. 343, and has been acknowledged in *1214 California (see Levin v. United Air Lines, Inc. (2008) 158 Cal. App. 4th 1002, 1019, fn. 21 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 535]). But our courts have not resolved the issue. (Compare In re M.S. (1995) 10 Cal. 4th 698, 710 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 355, 896 P.2d 1365] [\"When a reasonable person would foresee that the context and import of the words will cause the listener to believe he or she will be subjected to physical violence, the threat falls outside First Amendment protection.\"] and USS-Posco Industries v. Edwards (2003) 111 Cal. App. 4th 436, 444-446 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 54] [1st Amend. does not protect threats that cause listeners to fear for their safety] with Levin v. United Air Lines, Inc., supra, at pp. 1019-1025 & fn. 21 [noting split of authority but declining to resolve issue where plaintiff who brought suit for false imprisonment had been arrested for making false bomb report, not threat of bodily harm].) We need not decide which standard is the correct one because we apply both of them. (See pt. II.B, post; Fogel v. Collins, supra, 531 F.3d at p. 831.)\n\n2. Public Issue\n\nThe anti-SLAPP statute applies where \"[a] cause of action against a person aris[es] from any act of that person in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a public issue . . . .\" (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1), italics added.)\n\n(7) As used in the statute, \"`act in furtherance of a person's right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue' includes: (1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law; (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official proceeding authorized by law; (3) any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest; (4) or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.\" (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e), italics added; see Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope & Opportunity (1999) 19 Cal. 4th 1106, 1117-1118, 1123 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 471, 969 P.2d 564] [discussing types of statements covered by anti-SLAPP statute].) The R.'s contend that plaintiffs' complaint falls within the third clause of section 425.16, subdivision (e).\n\n(8) The anti-SLAPP statute contains no definition of \"public issue\" or \"public interest.\" That might be attributable to an assumption that \"`\"no standards are necessary because [judges and attorneys] will, or should, know *1215 a public concern when they see it.\"'\" (Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope & Opportunity, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 1122, fn. 9; see Du Charme v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (2003) 110 Cal. App. 4th 107, 117 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 501].)\n\n\"`\"The anti-SLAPP statute's definitional focus is not the form of the plaintiff's cause of action but, rather, the defendant's activity that gives rise to his or her asserted liability\u2014and whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.\" . . .'\" (Feldman v. 1100 Park Lane Associates (2008)  160 Cal.

Sletten (2002) 29 Cal. 4th 82, 91-93 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703].)\n\n\"`\"The definition of `public interest' within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP statute has been broadly construed to include not only governmental matters, but also private conduct that impacts a broad segment of society and/or that affects a community in a manner similar to that of a governmental entity. . . .\" . . . \"Although matters of public interest include legislative and governmental activities, they may also include activities that involve private persons and entities, especially when a large, powerful organization may impact the lives of many individuals.\" . . .'\" (Kurwa v. Harrington, Foxx, Dubrow & Canter, LLP (2007)  146 Cal. App. 4th 841, 846 [53 Cal.Rptr.3d 256], citations omitted; accord, Damon v. Ocean Hills Journalism Club (2000) 85 Cal. App. 4th 468, 479 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 205].)\n\n(9) In general, \"[a] public issue is implicated if the subject of the statement or activity underlying the claim (1) was a person or entity in the public eye; (2) could affect large numbers of people beyond the direct participants; or (3) involved a topic of widespread, public interest.\" (Jewett v. Capital One Bank (2003)  113 Cal. App. 4th 805, 814 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 675]; accord, World Financial Group, Inc. v. HBW Ins. & Financial Services, Inc. (2009)  172 Cal. App. 4th 1561, 1573 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 227]; Century 21 Chamberlain & Associates v. Haberman (2009) 173 Cal. App. 4th 1, 9 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 249].) \"[T]o satisfy the public issue/issue of public interest requirement in situations where the issue is of interest only to a limited, but definable portion of the public, such as a private group, organization, or community, `the constitutionally protected activity must, at a minimum, occur in the context of an ongoing controversy, dispute or discussion, such that it warrants protection by a statute that embodies the public policy of encouraging participation in matters of public significance.'\" (Hailstone v. Martinez (2008) 169 Cal. App. 4th 728, 738 [87 Cal.Rptr.3d 347]; accord, World Financial Group, Inc. v. HBW Ins. & Financial Services, Inc., supra, at pp. 1572-1573.)\n\n*1216 \"`The fact that \"a broad and amorphous public interest\" can be connected to a specific dispute is not sufficient to meet the statutory requirements' of the anti-SLAPP statute. . . . By focusing on society's general interest in the subject matter of the dispute instead of the specific speech or conduct upon which the complaint is based, defendants resort to the oft-rejected, so-called `synecdoche theory of public issue in the anti-SLAPP statute,' where `[t]he part [is considered] synonymous with the greater whole.' . . . In evaluating the first [step] of the anti-SLAPP statute, we must focus on `the specific nature of the speech rather than the generalities that might be abstracted from it. . . .'\" (World Financial Group, Inc. v.

Parties' Burdens on the Motion\n\n(10) \"[The anti-SLAPP statute] requires the [trial] court to engage in a two-step process. First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity. The moving defendant's burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken `in furtherance of the [defendant]'s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California Constitution in connection with a public issue,' as defined in the statute. (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).) If the court finds such a showing has been made, it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim. Under section 425.16, subdivision (b)(2), the trial court in making these determinations considers `the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.'\" (Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal. 4th 53, 67 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685], italics added.)\n\n(11) Put another way, \"a defendant seeking to strike a plaintiff's complaint under section 425.16 has the burden of making a prima facie showing that the plaintiff's allegations are subject to that section. . . . Only if the defendant satisfies that burden, will it then fall to the plaintiff to establish the required `probability' of success. . . . The defendant's burden requires that it demonstrate that the plaintiff's cause of action arose from some act of the defendant that was taken in furtherance of the defendant's constitutional rights of petition or free speech.\" (Gallimore v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Ins. Co. (2002)  102 Cal. App. 4th 1388, 1397 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 560], italics added & omitted, citations omitted; accord, Club Members for an Honest Election v.

If this were the case then the [secondary] inquiry as to whether the plaintiff has established a probability of success would be superfluous.'\" (Navellier v. Sletten, supra, 29 Cal.4th at pp. 94-95, italics added; accord, Jarrow Formulas, Inc. v. LaMarche (2003) 31 Cal. 4th 728, 740 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 636, 74 P.3d 737].)\n\nUnder the first step, the defendant must make a showing that the complaint is based on protected activity. (See Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc., supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 67; World Financial Group, Inc. v. HBW Ins. & Financial Services, Inc., supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at p. 1568.) Some courts have described the requisite showing as \"prima facie\"; some have referred to it as \"threshold\"; and some have used \"prima facie\" and \"threshold\" interchangeably. (See, e.g., Rezec v. Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (2004) 116 Cal. App. 4th 135, 139 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 333] [prima facie showing]; Manhattan Loft, LLC v. Mercury Liquors, Inc. (2009) 173 Cal. App. 4th 1040, 1049 [93 Cal.Rptr.3d 457] [same]; Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc., supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 67 [threshold showing]; Episcopal Church Cases (2009) 45 Cal. 4th 467, 477 [87 Cal.Rptr.3d 275, 198 P.3d 66] [same]; Club Members for an Honest Election v. Sierra Club, supra, 45 Cal.4th at pp. 315-316 [prima facie showing and threshold showing]; Gallimore v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Ins. Co., supra, 102 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1396-1397 [same].) The term \"prima facie\" can be a source of confusion because it has several meanings. (See, e.g., Koch v. Specialized Care Services, Inc. (D.Md. 2005) 437 F. Supp. 2d 362, 378-380; Dolan v. Powers (Mo.Ct.App. 2008) 260 S.W.3d 376, 385; Berry v. State (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1984) 453 So. 2d 197, 198; In re Napp Technologies, Inc. (2000) 338 N.J. Super. 176 [768 A.2d 274, 279 & fn. 3]; Black's Law Dict. (8th ed. 2004) p. 1228, cols. 1, 2 [defining \"prima facie\" and \"prima facie case\"].) The anti-SLAPP statute itself does not use either \"prima facie\" or \"threshold,\" but simply states that \"[a] cause of action\" is \"subject to a special motion to strike\" if it \"aris[es] from any act . . . in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech . . . in connection with a public issue.\" (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1), italics added.) Regardless of whether \"prima facie\" or \"threshold\" is the judicially created term of choice, the result should be the same.\n\n(12) Although we \"generally presume the validity of the claimed constitutional right in the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis, and then permit the parties to address [that] issue in the second step of the analysis, if necessary\" (Chavez v. Mendoza (2001) 94 Cal. App. 4th 1083, 1089 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 825]), the general presumption is not appropriate where, as here, the \"statement or writing\" (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(3)), on its face, is a threat of bodily harm, and all of the causes of action are based on the same statement or writing.\n\n*1218 (13) Accordingly, to prevail on the first step under the anti-SLAPP analysis, the R.'s must demonstrate that R.R.'s posted message is protected speech and that it was made in connection with a public issue. We conclude the R.'s failed in both respects.\n\nB. Free Speech Under the Anti-SLAPP Statute\n\n(14) As noted, the First Amendment does not protect true threats\u2014 \"statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.\" (Virginia v. Black, supra, 538 U.S. at p. 359.) \"The speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat.\" (Id. at pp. 359-360.) \"`A true threat is a serious one, not uttered in jest, idle talk, or political argument.'\" (U.S. v. Fuller (7th Cir. 2004) 387 F.3d 643, 646.) The First Amendment protects parody, rhetorical hyperbole, and loose, figurative, or hyperbolic language. (Lam v. Ngo (2001)  91 Cal. App. 4th 832, 849 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 582]; Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. (1990) 497 U.S. 1, 21 [111 L.Ed.2d 1, 110 S.Ct. 2695]; Hustler Magazine v. Falwell (1988) 485 U.S. 46, 51, 56 [99 L.Ed.2d 41, 108 S.Ct. 876].)\n\nAs a preliminary matter, we note that \"[o]nline bullying, called cyberbullying, happens when teens use the Internet, cell phones, or other devices to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] Contrary to what cyberbullies may believe, cyberbullying is a big deal, and can cause a variety of reactions in teens. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] Many youth experience a variety of emotions when they are cyberbullied. Youth who are cyberbullied report feeling angry, hurt, embarrassed, or scared.\" (National Crime Prevention Council, Cyberbullying [as of Mar. 15, 2010].) \"Children have killed each other and committed suicide after having been involved in a cyberbullying incident. [\u00b6] Cyberbullying is usually not a one time communication, unless it involves a death threat or a credible threat of serious bodily harm.\" (Stop Cyberbullying [as of Mar. 15, 2010].) \"In studies of middle and high school students, . . . the most common way that children and youth reported being cyberbullied was through instant messaging. Somewhat less common ways involved the use of chat rooms, emails, and messages posted on Web sites.\" (Cyberbullying [as of Mar. 15, 2010], italics added, citation omitted.)\n\n\"Cyberbullying has increased in recent years. In nationally representative surveys of 10-17 year-olds, twice as many children and youth indicated that they had been victims and perpetrators of online harassment in 2005 compared with 1999/2000 . . . .\" (Cyberbullying [as of Mar. 15, 2010].)\n\n*1219 1. Reasonable Recipient Standard\n\nUnder the objective standard for true threats, we begin our analysis with the text of R.R.'s posted message: \"Hey [D.C.], I want to rip out your fucking heart and feed it to you. I heard your song while driving my kid to school and from that moment on I've . . . wanted to kill you. If I ever see you I'm . . . going to pound your head in with an ice pick. Fuck you, you dick-riding penis lover. I hope you burn in hell.\"\n\nThis message is unequivocal. A serious expression of intent to inflict bodily harm is conveyed no less than three times by the phrases \"rip out your fucking heart,\" \"want[] to kill you,\" and \"pound your head in with an ice pick.\" That these words produce grotesque and exaggerated images does not lessen the gravity of the threat. An intent to harm the recipient is also shown by the use of \"fuck you,\" \"burn in hell,\" and \"dick-riding penis lover,\" indicating that the author is angry. The message does not even hint that it is the result of the author's reaction to the recipient's Web site.\n\nThe threat in this case was not merely a few words shouted during a brawl; it was a series of grammatically correct sentences composed at a computer keyboard over a period of at least several minutes. Even after the message was typed, the author still had to decide whether to send it. He placed his cursor over \"send\" and clicked the mouse or touchpad. Thus, the content of the message and its transmission show deliberation on the part of the author.\n\n(15) The R.'s contend that the reference to the use of an ice pick and the biological impossibility of eating one's own heart make clear that the message was a joke. They also argue that, on its face, the message indicates that the underlying motivation was a dislike of the recipient's song, not his perceived sexual orientation. These contentions are unpersuasive or irrelevant. The true threat analysis does not require that a speaker intend to inflict bodily harm in the precise manner described in a threat. Nor does the speaker have to intend to kill his victim. Rather, if the threat conveys a serious expression of an intent to inflict bodily harm at all or in any manner, it is not constitutionally protected. Further, a reasonable person would not interpret the threat here as being motivated by a dislike of the recipient's song. That a one-time hearing of a song on the radio could generate so vitriolic a reaction defies reason. Moreover, this was a threat made by a high school student to a fellow student. Was it reasonably foreseeable to the teenage speaker that the message would be interpreted by another teenager as a threat of bodily harm? We think so. A high school bully might well use similar words. In addition, the true threat analysis focuses on intent, not motive. Whether a misperception of D.C.'s sexual orientation motivated R.R. is relevant in determining liability under the hate crimes statutes (see Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 51.7, 52.1) but not in resolving the First Amendment issue.\n\n*1220 Other evidence supports the conclusion that a reasonable person would foresee that R.R.'s message would be viewed as a threat of bodily harm. D.C.'s father closed down the Web site immediately upon seeing the derogatory and threatening posts and contacted the police. The police thought it prudent that D.C. not return to Harvard-Westlake until their investigation was completed and so advised D.C.'s father. D.C. returned to the school only once\u2014for a PSAT class under the watchful eye of his father. When the police investigation dragged on, D.C., who was in his junior year, withdrew from Harvard-Westlake to avoid missing more classes. Plaintiffs moved to Northern California, where D.C. attended another school. D.C.'s father had to travel back and forth from the family's new residence to Los Angeles for business purposes.\n\nIt was not until sometime after plaintiffs discovered the posts that they learned the names of the students who were responsible. Consequently, the way in which plaintiffs reacted to the posts was not affected by information about the specific characteristics, beliefs, or charitable activities of any of the students. Under a standard of reasonableness, plaintiffs were not required to know that the author of R.R.'s message was in a self-described \"playful mood\" or that he was an exemplary individual.\n\nMany of the posts at D.C.'s Web site did not constitute threats of any kind, and plaintiffs admit as much, stating that they perceived only six of the 34 derogatory posts as serious threats of bodily harm. That the majority of posts may have been nonthreatening does not lessen the effect of R.R.'s post. The law did not obligate plaintiffs to view all of the posts as having the same purpose or intent. In the opinion of D.C.'s father: \"[R.R.'s message] was the most evil and malicious of the postings and looked to come from a parent rather than a student. My family was terrified and made physically nauseous from the threat.\" Accordingly, plaintiffs sued only six students.\n\nThe R.'s emphasize that D.C. did not see the messages posted at the Web site. That is beside the point. He subsequently learned about the messages and reacted with fear for his own safety, eventually requiring medical attention for panic attacks. \"[A] prohibition on true threats `protect[s] individuals from the fear of violence' and `from the disruption that fear engenders,' in addition to protecting people `from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.'\" (Virginia v. Black, supra, 538 U.S. at p. 360.) Similarly, that students other than R.R. found the posts as a whole to be funny or amusing does not suggest how plaintiffs should have viewed R.R.'s post in particular.\n\nAs reported by his father, D.C. was approached by people who \"discuss[ed] what was posted and asked [D.C.] about being gay. It was clear that others [who] read the posts believed the comments about his sexual orientation and felt concern for him and his safety.\" (Italics added.)\n\n*1221 Thus, a reasonable person would foresee that R.R.'s post would be interpreted by D.C. and his parents as a serious expression of an intent to inflict bodily harm. It follows that the R.'s failed to make a sufficient showing of First Amendment protection under an objective standard for identifying true threats.\n\n2. Actual Intent Standard\n\nUnder the subjective standard, we first examine the content of R.R.'s post, as recited verbatim in his declaration: \"`Hey [D.C.], I want to rip out your fucking heart and feed it to you. I heard your song while driving my kid to school and from that moment on I've . . . wanted to kill you. If I ever see you I'm . . . going to pound your head in with an ice pick. Fuck you, you dick-riding penis lover. I hope you burn in hell.'\"\n\nOn its face, this post would not support a finding of jocular intent. The tone is serious, not humorous. The message describes violent conduct the author \"wants\" to commit, expresses the author's feelings of anger and hatred, and indicates the author will physically attack the recipient if he ever sees him. The content of the message shows it was written with deliberation. An intent to harm is evident.\n\nFor their part, the R.'s rely primarily on the evidence in the declarations of R.R. and his father describing R.R.'s good character and conduct on other occasions and with respect to other people. But R.R. also stated in his declaration that, when he posted the message, he was attempting \"to win the one-upmanship contest that was tacitly taking place,\" and, after posting the message, he felt \"ashamed\" he had allowed \"the desire for peer approval, `peer pressure,' to induce [him] into acting like an idiot.\"\n\nAs our Supreme Court commented in recognizing the need to supervise high school students: \"Supervision . . . is required, in part, so that discipline may be maintained and student conduct regulated. Such regulation is necessary precisely because of the commonly known tendency of students to engage in aggressive and impulsive behavior which exposes them and their peers to the risk of serious physical harm. High school students may appear to be generally less hyperactive and more capable of self-control than grammar school children. Consequently, less rigorous and intrusive methods of supervision may be required. Nevertheless, adolescent high school students are not adults and should not be expected to exhibit that degree of discretion, judgment, and concern for the safety of themselves and others which we associate with full maturity. . . . `[W]e should not close our eyes to the fact that . . . boys of seventeen and eighteen years of age, particularly in groups where the herd instinct and competitive spirit tend naturally to relax *1222 vigilance, are not accustomed to exercise the same amount of care for their own safety as persons of more mature years.'\" (Dailey v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. (1970) 2 Cal. 3d 741, 748 [87 Cal.Rptr. 376, 470 P.2d 360], fn. omitted.) R.R.'s declaration suggests he succumbed to a \"`herd instinct' \"\u2014\"the commonly known tendency of students to engage in aggressive and impulsive behavior which exposes them and their peers to the risk of serious physical harm.\" (Ibid., italics added.) It is irrelevant, for First Amendment purposes, that R.R. may not have intended to carry out his threat. (See Virginia v. Black, supra, 538 U.S. at pp. 359-360.)\n\n(16) Even assuming R.R. believed that his message was humorous, he may still have intended it as a threat. Self-amusement and wrongful conduct are not mutually exclusive. As explained by the National Crime Prevention Council: \"Cyberbullying is a problem that affects almost half of all American teens. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] When teens were asked why they think others cyberbully, 81 percent said that cyberbullies think it's funny.\" (National Crime Prevention Council, Cyberbullying [as of Mar. 15, 2010], italics added.) \"`[T]he peculiar sense of humor attributable to this defendant does not lessen the seriousness of the legal consequences of his acts.'\" (State ex rel. RT (La. 2001) 781 So. 2d 1239, 1245, fn. 9.) \"[I]ndividuals of a completely distorted sense of humor or pranksters with juvenile minds have . . . induced fear by [their] acts.\" (Ibid.; accord, U.S. v. Silver (E.D.Pa. 1961) 196 F. Supp. 677, 678.) \"[W]e reject [R.R.'s] argument that his statements were not `true threats' because they were merely `jests to show toughness and to establish a position among other [students].'\" (U.S. v. Stewart (9th Cir. 2005) 420 F.3d 1007, 1019, fn. 9.)\n\nFurther, the actions taken by R.R.'s parents in response to his message contradict the assertion that R.R. intended to play a mere joke. They terminated his access to the Internet, grounded him, prohibited his use of cell phones except for emergencies, and took away his driving privileges. They had him evaluated by a psychiatrist to ensure his \"conduct was never repeated and the root cause, if any, was dealt with immediately.\" (Italics added.) This evidence suggests that R.R.'s parents thought the \"root cause\" of his behavior was something other than his sense of humor.\n\nUnder the subjective standard, we inquire into whether R.R. intended that his message be interpreted as a threat. (See Fogel v. Collins, supra, 531 F.3d at pp. 831-833; U.S. v. Parr, supra, 545 F.3d at pp. 498-502.) The message itself implies he did. His statements about one-upmanship, peer pressure, and idiocy imply he did. The actions of his parents imply he did. The statements about his jocular intent, good character, and specific behavior on other occasions imply he did not. Thus, the R.'s have presented conflicting evidence on the subject of intent. It is a conflict borne of self-contradiction: *1223 The material facts and inferences drawn from portions of R.R.'s and his father's declarations are inconsistent with the material facts and inferences drawn from other portions of the same declarations. Because we cannot weigh the R.'s evidence, we cannot resolve the conflicts.\n\nWe therefore conclude that the R.'s did not make a sufficient showing of protected speech under the subjective standard of the true threat analysis. (See, e.g., In re Holm (9th Cir. 1991) 931 F.2d 620, 623 [creditor's claim in bankruptcy is prima facie valid if it sets forth necessary facts without self-contradiction]; City of Colorado Springs v. Forance (Colo. 1989) 776 P.2d 1107, 1110-1111 [defendant's conflicting evidence failed to establish prima facie case]; Center Candy, Inc. v. CJB Food Mart, Inc. (N.Y.App.Dist. 2008) 50 A.D.3d 723, 724 [854 N.Y.S.2d 317, 318] [plaintiff failed to establish prima facie case based on conflicting evidence]; Mohan v.

Mandel (N.Y.App.Dist. 1964) 21 A.D.2d 219, 222-223 [249 N.Y.S.2d 806, 809-810] [conflicting assertions as to defendants' motive and intent precluded plaintiff from establishing prima facie tort], affd. (N.Y. 1964) 15 N.Y.2d 616 [255 N.Y.S.2d 660, 203 N.E.2d 914]; Boyas v. Raymond (1939) 302 Mass. 519 [20 N.E.2d 411, 412] [where two pieces of evidence are, by statute, to be given prima facie effect but that evidence is conflicting, no prima facie effect is given]; Kilgore v. Gannon (1916) 185 Ind. 682 [114 N.E. 446, 448] [prima facie presumption of testator's soundness of mind, which arises from probate of will, does not apply where evidence of testator's sanity is in conflict].)\n\n(17) Our conclusion under both the objective and subjective standards is compelled in part by the purpose of the first step in the anti-SLAPP analysis\u2014to determine whether \"the operative complaint is `within the class of suits subject' to the special motion to strike procedure.\" (Brill Media Co., LLC v. TCW Group, Inc. (2005) 132 Cal. App. 4th 324, 331 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 371], italics added; see id. at pp. 329-331.) If a complaint is subject to the anti-SLAPP statute, that is, if the defendant makes the requisite showing that the complaint is based on protected speech or petitioning activity, the plaintiff must then offer evidence, typically at the pleading stage, to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits. (Id. at p. 328; see \u00a7 425.16, subds. (f), (g) [anti-SLAPP motion should be filed within 60 days of service of *1224 complaint unless court permits otherwise; upon filing notice of motion, all discovery is stayed].) If the plaintiff fails in that regard, the complaint is dismissed and the plaintiff is liable for the defendant's attorney fees. (See \u00a7 425.16, subd. (c).) Thus, the two steps serve different purposes: The first step determines whether the complaint comes within the scope of the anti-SLAPP statute (see Flatley v. Mauro, supra, 39 Cal.4th at pp. 313-318; Navarro v. IHOP Properties, Inc. (2005) 134 Cal. App. 4th 834, 843 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 385]), while the second step ensures \"`that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited'\" (Wilson v. Parker, Covert & Chidester (2002) 28 Cal. 4th 811, 821 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 19, 50 P.3d 733]).\n\n(18) In a case alleging statutory hate crimes and related common law claims, the courts should ensure that the anti-SLAPP statute does not discourage victims from seeking relief. That undesired effect would be likely if (1) the communication at issue appears on its face to be an intentional threat of bodily harm and was reasonably interpreted as such by the recipient, but (2) the trial court, in ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion, concludes the defendant has satisfied the first step of the analysis based on conflicting evidence of intent. If the defendant's burden at the first step were so easily met in a case like this one, victims would often be put to the task, early in the litigation, of proving a probability of success on the merits. \"`These [would be] . . . grossly unfair burdens to impose on a plaintiff who is himself the victim of the defendant's [wrongful] activity.'\" (Flatley v. Mauro, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 318.) And efforts to enforce the hate crimes laws would be chilled. (See San Ramon Valley Fire Protection Dist. v. Contra Costa County Employees' Retirement Assn. (2004) 125 Cal. App. 4th 343, 357-358 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 724] [if plaintiffs who challenge governmental conduct were routinely subject to anti-SLAPP motions and required to show merit at the pleading stage, their use of petitions for writ of mandate to review legislative and administrative decisions would be chilled].)\n\n(19) We do not suggest that R.R.'s message was illegal as a matter of law. (See Flatley v. Mauro, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 317 [anti-SLAPP statute \"cannot be invoked by a defendant whose assertedly protected activity is illegal as a matter of law and, for that reason, not protected by constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition\"].) Nor do we require the R.'s to show as a matter of law that R.R.'s message was protected speech. (See id. at pp. 314, 319-320; Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal. 4th 260, 286 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 638, 139 P.3d 30].) Nevertheless, \"it would eviscerate the first step of the two-step inquiry set forth in the statute if the defendant's mere assertion that his underlying activity was constitutionally *1225 protected sufficed to shift the burden to the plaintiff to establish a probability of prevailing . . . . While a defendant need only make a prima facie showing that the underlying activity falls within the ambit of the statute, clearly the statute envisions that the courts do more than simply rubberstamp such assertions before moving on to the second step. . . . `[I]t is fundamentally fair that before putting the plaintiff to the burden of establishing probability of success on the merits the defendant be required to show imposing that burden is justified by the nature of the plaintiff's complaint.'\" (Flatley, at pp. 317-318, citation omitted.) \"[T]he plaintiff . . . has no obligation to demonstrate [a] probability of success if the defendant fails to meet [his] threshold burden [at the first step].\" (Gallimore v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Ins. Co., supra, 102 Cal.App.4th at p. 1396.)\n\nWhere a plaintiff seeks relief based on a threat of bodily harm, the author of the threat should not be able to satisfy his burden under the anti-SLAPP statute by talking out of both sides of his mouth. The courts should apply the statute to protect the rights of free speech and petition (see \u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1)), not to chill the pursuit of claims under the hate crimes laws and the common law.\n\nFinally, in applying the First Amendment, we do not defer to the legal conclusions of the parties or other persons on that subject. (See In re George T. (2004)  33 Cal. 4th 620, 632-634 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 61, 93 P.3d 1007].) For example, the decisions of the LAPD and the district attorney's office are not controlling under the true threat analysis. Further, those decisions related to a criminal investigation ending in no prosecution while the present case concerns civil liability. Although plaintiffs' statutory claim is denominated one for hate crimes, their cause of action is based on statutes imposing civil liability. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 51.7, 52.1.)\n\nNothing we have said will chill free speech. We have not suggested the R.'s will be found liable on any of plaintiffs' causes of action. A trier of fact may ultimately find that R.R.'s message was not a true threat. The narrow question on appeal is whether the R.'s may rely on the First Amendment to dismiss this lawsuit by way of an anti-SLAPP motion. As discussed, they may not. (See Huntingdon Life Sciences, Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. (2005)  129 Cal. App. 4th 1228, 1250-1258 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 521] [where plaintiffs' harassment claim was based on reports posted by defendants on Web site, anti-SLAPP motion was properly denied because 1st Amend, does not protect credible threats of violence].)\n\nIn sum, in light of the allegations in the complaint and the evidence submitted by both sides, the R.'s did not demonstrate that R.R.'s message was *1226 protected by the First Amendment. In statutory terms, the R.'s failed to show that plaintiffs' causes of action \"aris[e] from any act . . . in furtherance of the [R.'s] right of . . . free speech.\" (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)\n\nC. Public Issue Under the Anti-SLAPP Statute\n\nIn attempting to meet the statutory requirement that the complaint arise from speech made in connection with a public issue, the R.'s contend that D.C. was a \"public figure\" or a \"limited public figure\" and that anything said publicly about such a person necessarily involves a public issue. We conclude the complaint does not involve a public issue.\n\n(20) \"`Web sites accessible to the public . . . are \"public forums\" for purposes of the anti-SLAPP statute.'\" (Nyg\u00e5rd, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula (2008)  159 Cal. App. 4th 1027, 1039 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 210], italics added; accord, Barrett v. Rosenthal (2006) 40 Cal. 4th 33, 41, fn. 4 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 55, 146 P.3d 510].) But not every Web site post involves a public issue. (See \u00a7 425.16, subd. (e)(3) [requiring that speech be made in a public forum and in connection with an issue of public interest].) \"[M]ere publication . . . on a Web site . . . should not turn otherwise private information . . . into a matter of public interest.\" (Du Charme v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, supra, 110 Cal.App.4th at p. 117.)\n\n(21) No authority supports the R.'s broad proposition that anything said or written about a public figure or limited public figure in a public forum involves a public issue. Rather, as stated, the California cases establish that generally, \"[a] public issue is implicated if the subject of the statement or activity underlying the claim (1) was a person or entity in the public eye; (2) could affect large numbers of people beyond the direct participants; or (3) involved a topic of widespread, public interest.\" (Jewett v. Capital One Bank, supra, 113 Cal.App.4th at p. 814; see World Financial Group, Inc. v. HBW Ins. & Financial Services, Inc., supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at p. 1573; Century 21 Chamberlain & Associates v. Haberman, supra, 173 Cal.App.4th at p. 9.) And where the issue is of interest to only a private group, organization, or community, the protected activity must occur in the context of an ongoing controversy, dispute, or discussion, such that its protection would encourage participation in matters of public significance. (Hailstone v. Martinez, supra, 169 Cal.App.4th at p. 738; World Financial Group, Inc. v. HBW Ins. & Financial Services, Inc., supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1572-1573.) None of those factors applies here.\n\nIn Nyg\u00e5rd, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula, supra, 159 Cal. App. 4th 1027, a former employee of Nyg\u00e5rd, Inc., and Nyg\u00e5rd International Partnership gave an interview to a Finnish magazine about his work experiences. The resulting *1227 article included negative comments about the companies' founder and chairman of the board, Peter Nyg\u00e5rd. The companies filed suit against the magazine in California and were met with an anti-SLAPP motion. The trial court found that the magazine had satisfied the first step of the statutory analysis \"because [the] evidence showed that the [employer] and its founder, Nyg\u00e5rd, `are internationally known public figures who spend a great deal of money and effort to promote their business, success, wealth and lifestyle.' Further, [Nyg\u00e5rd's companies] employ over 12,000 employees worldwide. Thus, the court said, the statements . . . published by the magazine involved highly visible public figures and issues of public interest.\" (Id. at p. 1034.)\n\nThe Court of Appeal affirmed for different reasons, explaining: \"[The] cases and the legislative history . . . suggest that `an issue of public interest' within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(3) is any issue in which the public is interested. In other words, the issue need not be `significant' to be protected by the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014it is enough that it is one in which the public takes an interest. Judged by this standard, the trial court correctly concluded that the statements on which the present suit is based concern an issue of public interest. According to evidence introduced by defendants in support of their motions to strike, there is `extensive interest' in Nyg\u00e5rd\u2014`a prominent businessman and celebrity of Finnish extraction'\u2014among the Finnish public. Further, defendants' evidence suggests that there is particular interest among the magazine's readership in `information having to do with Mr. Nyg\u00e5rd's famous Bahamas residence which has been the subject of much publicity in Finland.' The . . . article was intended to satisfy that interest.\" (Nyg\u00e5rd, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula, supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at p. 1042, italics added & omitted.)\n\n\"In Seelig v. Infinity Broadcasting Corp. (2002) 97 Cal. App. 4th 798 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 108] . . ., the plaintiff was one of 50 contestants in the television program Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire . . . . A San Francisco radio show mocked the plaintiff's participation in the show, and the plaintiff sued the radio station for slander and other torts. . . . The Court of Appeal held that the suit was subject to a special motion to strike. Among other things, it held that the offending comments were made `\"in connection with an issue of public interest\"': `The offending comments arose in the context of an on-air discussion between the talk-radio cohosts and their on-air producer about a television show of significant interest to the public and the media. This program was a derivative of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, which had proven successful in generating viewership and advertising revenue . . . . By having chosen to participate as a contestant in the Show, plaintiff voluntarily subjected herself to inevitable scrutiny and potential ridicule by the public and the media.' . . .\n\n*1228 \"The court reached a similar result in Sipple v. Foundation for Nat. Progress (1999) 71 Cal. App. 4th 226 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 677]. There, the plaintiff[, Donald Sipple,] was a nationally known political consultant who had developed advertising campaigns for major political candidates. . . . He brought a suit for defamation and other torts after the defendant . . . published an article about a custody dispute between Sipple and his second wife. Among other things, the article discussed Sipple's first and second wives' testimony at the custody trial that he had physically and verbally abused them. . . . The trial court struck the complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute and the Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that the article concerned a matter of public interest. It [stated]: `Central to the article . . . are the allegations of physical and verbal abuse against a prominent media strategist by two former wives . . . . In 1994, appellant devised media strategy based on genderbased advertising against domestic violence for the gubernatorial races of Pete Wilson in California, George W. Bush in Texas and Jim Edgar in Illinois. Ironically, the custody dispute occurred while appellant was running the media strategy for Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign based on morality issues. In other words, appellant was able to capitalize on domestic violence issues in order to further his career.' . . . Accordingly, the court concluded, `[T]he details of appellant's career and appellant's ability to capitalize on domestic violence issues in his advertising campaigns for politicians known around the world, while allegedly committing violence against his former wives, are public issues, and the article is subject to the protection of section 425.16.'\" (Nyg\u00e5rd, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula, supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1042-1043, citations omitted, italics added.)\n\nAnd in Hall v. Time Warner, Inc. (2007) 153 Cal. App. 4th 1337 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 798], the Court of Appeal held that the producers of a television program could not be sued for airing an interview with Marlon Brando's housekeeper, Blanche Hall, who was named as a beneficiary in Brando's living trust. The court concluded that the anti-SLAPP statute barred suit, stating: \"The public's fascination with Brando and widespread public interest in his personal life made Brando's decisions concerning the distribution of his assets a public issue or an issue of public interest. Although Hall was a private person and may not have voluntarily sought publicity or to comment publicly on Brando's will, she nevertheless became involved in an issue of public interest by virtue of being named in Brando's will. Defendants' television broadcast contributed to the public discussion of the issue by identifying Hall as a beneficiary and showing her on camera.\" (Id. at p. 1347, italics added.)\n\nAs noted, \"[i]n evaluating the first [step] of the anti-SLAPP statute, we must focus on `the specific nature of the speech rather than the generalities that might be abstracted from it. . . .'\" (World Financial Group, Inc. v. HBW Ins. & Financial Services, Inc., supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at p. 1570.) Here, *1229 the R.'s liability is premised on a Web site message from one teenager to another. The message does not mention a public issue. Rather, it combines a threat of bodily harm with derogatory language.\n\nFurther, the public was not fascinated with D.C., nor was there widespread public interest in his personal life. There is no evidence that he was a nationally known singer or actor even under his pseudonym, Danny Alexander. Indeed, R.R. stated in his declaration that, before seeing D.C.'s Web site, \"I had not heard anything about [D.C.] I had no knowledge of his acting or singing involvement [and] did not know his interests or habits . . . .\" In short, D.C. was no Brando.\n\nAdmittedly, as alleged in the complaint, D.C. had a record album with a planned release date, had broadcast a song worldwide via satellite radio, and had played the leading role in a feature film presented at an internationally acclaimed film festival. He had also toured under the auspices of a nationally recognized radio network. But unlike the defendants in other cases (see Nyg\u00e5rd, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula, supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at p. 1042; Sipple v. Foundation for Nat. Progress, supra, 71 Cal.App.4th pp. 231-234, 239-240; Seelig v. Infinity Broadcasting Corp., supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at pp. 801, fn. 1, 807, fn. 5), the R.'s did not offer any evidence to show that plaintiff\u2014 here, D.C.\u2014was known to the public or was in the public eye. D.C.'s use of a Web site in pursuing an entertainment career did not, ipso facto, put him in the public eye. Millions of teenagers use MySpace, Facebook, and YouTube to display their interests and talents, but the posting of that information hardly makes them celebrities. In addition, D.C.'s record album was released after the posting of the messages, so it did not create any public interest in him at the relevant time. Similarly, the film in which D.C. had the lead, Steal Me, had not yet been released. Absent evidence on the point, we cannot say that, as of the date of R.R.'s message, D.C.'s stint in entertainment had garnered public attention.\n\nAs the R.'s would have it, R.R.'s message, like the rest of the posted messages, was part of a joke played on D.C. by other teenagers. Assuming the message was a joke, it did not implicate a public issue. (See Polish American Congress v. F.C.C. (7th Cir. 1975) 520 F.2d 1248, 1250, 1253-1256 [television broadcast of derogatory Polish jokes did not involve a public issue or an issue of public importance]; Shub v. Westchester Community College (S.D.N.Y. 2008)  556 F. Supp. 2d 227, 244-246 [professor's comments about college president's inappropriate use of sexual jokes did not relate to an issue of public concern]; Pereira v. Commissioner of Social Services (2000) 432 Mass. 251 [733 N.E.2d 112, 116 & fns. 8, 9, 118-119] [employee's racist joke did not constitute speech on a matter of public concern].)\n\n*1230 Nor is the posted message in this case analogous to a magazine article that discusses a celebrity or to a television interview or radio show about a celebrity. (See Nyg\u00e5rd, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula, supra, 159 Cal. App. 4th 1027 [magazine article]; Sipple v. Foundation for Nat. Progress, supra, 71 Cal. App. 4th 226 [magazine article]; Hall v. Time Warner, Inc., supra, 153 Cal. App. 4th 1337 [television interview]; Seelig v. Infinity Broadcasting Corp., supra, 97 Cal. App. 4th 798 [radio show].) R.R.'s message is devoid of any information about D.C. The message stated in part, \"I heard your song while driving my kid to school and from that moment on I've . . . wanted to kill you.\" But R.R. admitted in his declaration that \"[he] obviously didn't have school age children and [he] had never listened to any of [D.C.'s] songs.\" (Italics added.) Plainly, R.R. did not intend that his message be interpreted as an opinion about D.C.'s singing ability. In contrast to the articles and broadcasts in Nyg\u00e5rd, Sipple, Hall, and Seelig, the message in this case was to, not about, a person, and the content of the communication added nothing to any public discourse or interest.\n\nSimply put, R.R.'s message did not concern a person in the public eye, conduct that could directly affect large numbers of people beyond the participants, or a topic of widespread public interest. (See Jewett v. Capital One Bank, supra, 113 Cal.App.4th at p. 814; World Financial Group, Inc. v. HBW Ins. & Financial Services, Inc., supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at p. 1573; Century 21 Chamberlain & Associates v. Haberman, supra, 173 Cal.App.4th at p. 9.) And, if the message was of interest to only a private group, organization, or community, it was not part of an ongoing controversy, dispute, or discussion, such that its protection would encourage participation in matters of public significance. (See Hailstone v. Martinez, supra, 169 Cal.App.4th at p. 738; World Financial Group, Inc. v. HBW Ins. & Financial Services, Inc., supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1572-1573.)\n\n(22) Finally, it appears that the R.'s have borrowed the term \"public figure\" from First Amendment jurisprudence. In that context, \"[the] designation [of public figure] may rest on either of two alternative bases. In some instances an individual may achieve such pervasive fame or notoriety that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all contexts. More commonly, an individual voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues. In either case such persons assume special prominence in the resolution of public questions.\" (Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974) 418 U.S. 323, 351 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 94 S.Ct. 2997], italics added.) D.C. did not achieve pervasive fame or notoriety, and he was not in the midst of a particular public controversy. (Cf. Carlisle v. Fawcett Publications, Inc. (1962) 201 Cal. App. 2d 733 [20 Cal.Rptr. 405] [actress Janet Leigh was a public figure]; Carafano v. Metrosplash.com Inc. (C.D.Cal. 2002) 207 F. Supp. 2d 1055, 1070-1072 [actress who had prominent role in Star Trek series and had extensive history of *1231 appearances on television, in motion pictures, and in advertising is a public figure], affd. (9th Cir. 2003) 339 F.3d 1119.)\n\nIn conclusion, because the R.'s did not satisfy their burden with respect to the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis, we do not consider whether plaintiffs demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits of their claims. (See City of Cotati v. Cashman (2002) 29 Cal. 4th 69, 80-81 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 519, 52 P.3d 695].) The trial court properly denied the R.'s anti-SLAPP motion.\n\nIII\n\nDISPOSITION\n\nThe order denying the special motion to strike is affirmed.\n\nJohnson, J., concurred.\n\nROTHSCHILD, J., Dissenting.\u2014\n\nThe majority affirms the denial of the anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) motion on the grounds that R.R.'s post (1) was a \"true threat\" and therefore was not constitutionally protected, and (2) was not in connection with an issue of public interest. I disagree with both conclusions and with the majority's reasoning, which alters the legal landscape to the severe detriment of First Amendment rights.\n\nIn deciding that the post was unprotected, the majority holds defendants to an evidentiary standard that conflicts with controlling California Supreme Court precedent, disregards defendants' evidence on the basis of invalid factual inferences and unsupported legal theories, and ignores the relevant case law by failing to consider the entire factual context in which R.R.'s post occurred. The majority does all of this in the name of protecting hate crime victims (maj. opn., ante, at p. 1224), but the majority acknowledges that because this lawsuit is still at the pleading stage, it may turn out that the suit does not involve a hate crime at all (maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1224, 1225).\n\nI share with the majority the view that R.R.'s post, like many that preceded and followed it, was vulgar, nasty, offensive, and disgusting. But, as Justice Harlan wrote in Cohen v. California (1971) 403 U.S. 15, 24-25 [29 L.Ed.2d 284, 91 S.Ct. 1780], although \"the immediate consequence of [free speech rights] may often appear to be only verbal tumult, discord, and even offensive utterance[,] . . . [w]e cannot lose sight of the fact that, in what otherwise might seem a trifling and annoying instance of individual distasteful abuse of a privilege, these fundamental societal values [of freedom of speech] are truly implicated.\"\n\n*1232 In concluding that the post was not in connection with an issue of public interest, the majority fails to follow relevant precedent and ignores the substantial evidence that D.C. was a person in the public eye. The majority also creates a broad and groundless exception to the protections of the anti-SLAPP statute, holding that for purposes of the statute, jokes do not constitute communications in connection with issues of public interest. (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1199, 1210, 1229.) That is not the law.\n\nApplication of the correct legal standards to the relevant facts and evidence demonstrates that defendants have carried their initial burden in support of the special motion to strike. I therefore dissent.\n\nI. The Prima Facie Showing Standard\n\nA defendant bringing an anti-SLAPP motion needs to make only a prima facie showing that the plaintiff's claims arise from constitutionally protected conduct. (See, e.g., Rezec v. Sony Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (2004) 116 Cal. App. 4th 135, 139 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 333].) The moving defendant need only introduce evidence that, if credited, would be sufficient to sustain any factual findings necessary to support the claim of constitutional protection.\n\nThe majority mentions the prima facie showing standard but does not actually apply it, instead requiring defendants to show that their conduct is constitutionally protected as a matter of law. The majority's opinion thus conflicts with controlling Supreme Court precedent and alters the law in a manner harmful to First Amendment rights.\n\n\"`The Legislature did not intend that in order to invoke the special motion to strike the defendant must first establish her actions are constitutionally protected under the First Amendment as a matter of law. If this were the case then the [secondary] inquiry as to whether the plaintiff has established a probability of success would be superfluous.'\" (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal. 4th 82, 94-95 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703] (hereafter Navellier), quoting Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc. v. Paladino (2001) 89 Cal. App. 4th 294, 305 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 906]; see also Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006)  39 Cal. 4th 260, 286 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 638, 139 P.3d 30] (hereafter Soukup) [\"There is no . . . requirement that the defendant initially demonstrate his or her exercise of constitutional rights of speech or petition was valid as a matter of law.\"].) \"Instead, under the statutory scheme, a court must generally presume the validity of the claimed constitutional right in the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis, and then permit the parties to address the issue in the second step of the analysis, if necessary. [Citation.] Otherwise, the second step would become superfluous in almost every case, resulting in an improper shifting of the burdens.\" (Chavez v. Mendoza (2001) *1233 94 Cal. App. 4th 1083, 1089 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 825]; see also Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 95 [citing with approval this portion of Chavez v. Mendoza]; Governor Gray Davis Com. v. American Taxpayers Alliance (2002) 102 Cal. App. 4th 449, 458 [125 Cal.Rptr.2d 534].)\n\nAccording to California's anti-SLAPP case law, a prima facie showing is merely a presentation of sufficient \"facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted [in support of those facts] is credited.\" (Matson v. Dvorak (1995) 40 Cal. App. 4th 539, 548 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 880]; see Taus v. Loftus (2007)  40 Cal. 4th 683, 713-714 [54 Cal.Rptr.3d 775, 151 P.3d 1185]; Soukup, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 291; Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at pp. 88-89.) The case law is clear on how a court should determine whether the requisite prima facie showing has been made: The court employs a \"summary-judgment-like procedure\" (Taus v. Loftus, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 714) and \"`does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence'\" (Soukup, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 291, italics omitted). (See also Vargas v. City of Salinas (2009) 46 Cal. 4th 1, 20 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 286, 205 P.3d 207]; Zamos v. Stroud (2004) 32 Cal. 4th 958, 965 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 54, 87 P.3d 802]; Jarrow Formulas, Inc. v. LaMarche (2003) 31 Cal. 4th 728, 741, fn. 10 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 636, 74 P.3d 737].) Rather, as long as the record contains \"evidence that, if credited, would be sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment\" (McGarry v. University of San Diego (2007) 154 Cal. App. 4th 97 [108, 64 Cal.Rptr.3d 467]), the prima facie showing standard has been met.[1]\n\nInstead of discussing the California case law explaining what constitutes a prima facie showing in the context of California's anti-SLAPP statute, the majority cites cases from Maryland, Missouri, Florida, and New Jersey for the proposition that the phrase \"prima facie\" is ambiguous. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1217.) Also, although the majority notes that at the first step the moving defendant need only make a prima facie showing of constitutional protection, the majority asserts that \"prima facie\" is just another way of saying \"threshold,\" adding that \"[r]egardless of whether `prima facie' or `threshold' is the judicially created term of choice, the result should be the same.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1217.) If the choice of terminology is really of no consequence, however, it is difficult to understand why the majority even brings up the term \"threshold.\" The only apparent explanation is that the majority wants to treat neither \"prima facie\" nor \"threshold\" as determining the standard that *1234 the showing must meet. Rather, for the majority the terms \"prima facie\" and \"threshold\" indicate only when the showing must be made\u2014for the majority, a \"prima facie\" or \"threshold\" showing is simply an initial showing, or a showing made at the beginning. But the question remains: What standard must the moving defendant meet in order to have made the requisite showing? The majority never says.\n\nThat gap in the majority's reasoning is particularly troubling because plaintiffs themselves have expressly conceded that defendants' showing was sufficient. In their respondents' brief, plaintiffs state that \"[a]s to each of the elements of a `true threat' as defined in [federal case law] . . . there is here conflicting evidence.\" (Italics added.) That is, plaintiffs concede that defendants have introduced evidence that supports their position on every element of the true threat theory. Thus, according to plaintiffs themselves, defendants have made a prima facie showing that R.R.'s post was not a true threat.\n\nWe are not, of course, bound by plaintiffs' concession. Plaintiffs might be wrong\u2014the record might actually contain no evidence sufficient to support defendants' position on the true threat theory. But the majority never says that either. On the contrary, the majority expressly concedes with respect to the subjective test that the record contains \"conflicting evidence on the subject of intent.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1222.) (The analysis presented in pts. III and IV of this dissent likewise confirms that the record contains sufficient evidence to support defendants' position.) The majority's statement that it has not required defendants \"to show as a matter of law that R.R.'s message was protected speech\" (maj. opn., ante, at p. 1224) therefore cannot be correct\u2014the majority acknowledges that the record contains sufficient evidence to support defendants' position, but the majority still concludes that defendants' showing was inadequate. It follows that the majority must be requiring something more than a prima facie showing, namely, a demonstration as a matter of law.\n\nIn addition, instead of acknowledging that the presence in the record of conflicting evidence establishes that defendants have made a prima facie showing, the majority states that \"we cannot resolve the conflicts\" in the evidence (maj. opn., ante, at p. 1223), so defendants lose. In determining whether defendants have made a prima facie showing, however, the court should have no occasion to resolve conflicts in the evidence\u2014the court is supposed to employ a \"summary-judgment-like procedure\" (Taus v. Loftus, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 714) and \"`does not weigh the credibility or *1235 comparative probative strength of competing evidence'\" (Soukup, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 291, italics omitted).[2]\n\nI conclude that the majority has in reality required defendants to show that R.R.'s conduct was protected as a matter of law, contrary to the Supreme Court's repeated holdings that no such showing is required. The majority has thus accomplished precisely the \"improper shifting of the burdens\" that the case law warns against (Chavez v. Mendoza, supra, 94 Cal.App.4th at p. 1089), to the detriment of the free speech rights that Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 was meant to safeguard.[3]\n\nII. The Subjective Test and the Objective Test\n\nThe majority states that \"[f]ederal courts are divided on whether the applicable standard [for true threats] should be objective or subjective.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1213.) But the subjective test is, in fact, constitutionally required according to a United States Supreme Court case, Virginia v. Black (2003) 538 U.S. 343 [155 L.Ed.2d 535, 123 S.Ct. 1536], which is controlling authority on issues of federal law. (See, e.g., McLaughlin v. Walnut Properties, Inc. (2004)  119 Cal. App. 4th 293, 297 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 369].)\n\nVirginia v. Black involved a First Amendment challenge to a Virginia statute that criminalized cross burning. (Virginia v. Black, supra, 538 U.S. at p. 347.) In the consolidated appeals of three defendants convicted under the statute, the Supreme Court of Virginia held that the statute was unconstitutional on its face, and the United States Supreme Court affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. (Id. at pp. 348, 351, 367-368.) The statute prohibited cross burning only if done \"`with the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons,'\" but the statute also provided that cross burning itself \"`shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to intimidate a person or group of persons.'\" (Id. at p. 348.)\n\nThe case generated a number of opinions from the justices of the United States Supreme Court. None was joined in its entirety by a majority, although Justice O'Connor's opinion did gain majority support in part and was the plurality opinion as to the remainder. But with the possible exception of Justice Thomas, the differences among the justices did not involve any disagreement about the principle that a \"true threat\" is unprotected only if it *1236 is made with intent to threaten (that is, with the intent that the communication be taken as a threat). In other words, at least eight of the nine justices agreed that subjective intent to threaten is constitutionally required.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court majority, \"`[t]rue threats' encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.\" (Virginia v. Black, supra, 538 U.S. at p. 359, italics added.) Similarly, according to the majority, \"[i]ntimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.\" (Id. at p. 360, italics added.) The significance of these statements by the Supreme Court majority is clear: In order for a communication to be an unprotected \"true threat,\" it must have been made with intent to threaten (i.e., the speaker must have subjectively intended that it be taken as a threat).\n\nExamination of the separate opinions of eight of the nine justices bears out that interpretation. The plurality opinion concluded that because the statute allowed the trier of fact to infer intent from the cross burning itself, the statute effectively relieved the government of the burden of proving the defendant's intent and therefore was unconstitutional. (Virginia v. Black, supra, 538 U.S. at pp. 364-365 (plur. opn.) [the statute \"strips away the very reason why a State may ban cross burning with the intent to intimidate\"].) The separate opinion of Justice Scalia (who was not a member of the plurality) expressly endorsed that principle, observing that the plurality found the statute \"constitutionally problematic because `a burning cross is not always intended to intimidate'\" and agreeing that \"[t]he plurality is correct in all of this . . . .\" (Id. at p. 372 (conc. & dis. opn. of Scalia, J.).) Justice Scalia disagreed only with the plurality's facial invalidation of the statute, reasoning that instead the court should have allowed case-by-case challenges to convictions if the statute had in fact operated to relieve the prosecution of its burden to prove intent. (Id. at pp. 372-373 (conc. & dis. opn. of Scalia, J.).) Justice Souter, joined by Justices Kennedy and Ginsburg, likewise agreed that the speaker's subjective intent to intimidate is what makes the conduct \"proscribable.\" (Id. at pp. 385-386 (conc. & dis. opn. of Souter, J.).) Justice Souter disagreed only with the plurality's decision to leave open the possibility that the Virginia courts could, on remand, interpret the statute in such a way as to save it from unconstitutionality (id. at p. 367 (plur. opn.)); in Justice Souter's view, no such saving interpretation was possible (id. at p. 387 (conc. & dis. opn. of Souter, J.)).\n\nThus, eight justices of the United States Supreme Court (the four-justice plurality, plus Justices Scalia, Souter, Kennedy, and Ginsburg) all agree that *1237 for a true threat to be constitutionally unprotected, it must be made with subjective intent to threaten (i.e., subjective intent that it be taken as a threat), and the Supreme Court's majority opinion defines unprotected true threats as statements in which \"the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence . . .\" or speaks \"with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.\" (Virginia v. Black, supra, 538 U.S. at pp. 359-360.)\n\nI conclude that in order for speech to be an unprotected true threat, the speaker must subjectively intend that the speech be taken as a threat. Only one published federal appellate decision has analyzed Virginia v. Black in detail, and it reached the same conclusion. (U.S. v. Cassel (9th Cir. 2005)  408 F.3d 622, 624, 630-633 [\"We are therefore bound to conclude that speech may be deemed unprotected by the First Amendment as a `true threat' only upon proof that the speaker subjectively intended the speech as a threat.\"]; see also U.S. v. Magleby (10th Cir. 2005) 420 F.3d 1136, 1139; Ward v. Utah (10th Cir. 2005) 398 F.3d 1239, 1249.)[4] Moreover, in their briefs on appeal, both plaintiffs and defendants take the position that the subjective test is required. According to plaintiffs, \"[i]t is the law that a threat cannot be penalized unless it is subjectively intended to intimidate and would put a reasonable person in fear of bodily harm.\"\n\nBecause the subjective test is constitutionally required, this court must first determine whether defendants have made a prima facie showing that R.R.'s *1238 post did not constitute a true threat under that test. If they have, then application of the objective test is irrelevant.\n\nIII. Defendants' Evidence and the Self-contradiction Theory\n\nIn his declaration filed in support of defendants' anti-SLAPP motion, R.R. explains that he intended the post merely as a joke. If that is true, then he did not intend the post to be taken as a serious expression of intent to commit an act of unlawful violence, so it could not be a true threat under the subjective test. Defendants have therefore made a prima facie showing of constitutional protection, because R.R.'s declaration constitutes \"evidence that, if credited, would be sufficient to sustain a favorable [ruling].\" (McGarry v. University of San Diego, supra, 154 Cal.App.4th at p. 108.)\n\nAs already noted, however, the majority concedes that the record contains \"conflicting evidence on the subject of intent\" but claims \"[i]t is a conflict borne of self-contradiction\" which \"we cannot resolve,\" so defendants lose. (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1222-1223.) The majority's conclusion thus depends entirely on the validity and application of this self-contradiction theory.\n\nThere is indeed a doctrine relating to self-contradiction under California law, but it has nothing to do with this case. \"[W]hen discovery has produced an admission or concession on the part of the party opposing summary judgment which demonstrates that there is no factual issue to be tried,\" a contrary declaration submitted by that party may be disregarded. (D'Amico v. Board of Medical Examiners (1974) 11 Cal. 3d 1, 21-22 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10] (hereafter D'Amico).) Under the D'Amico rule a party cannot defeat a summary judgment motion by submitting a declaration that retracts the factual admissions that the party made in discovery. \"In a nutshell, the rule bars a party opposing summary judgment from filing a declaration that purports to impeach his or her own prior sworn testimony.\" (Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 1510, 1522 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 826].)\n\nThat rule has no application here. The self-contradiction rule applies only when one sworn statement contradicts another sworn statement. (See, e.g., Visueta v. General Motors Corp. (1991) 234 Cal. App. 3d 1609, 1613 [286 Cal.Rptr. 402] [deposition testimony]; Union Bank v. Superior Court (1995)  31 Cal. App. 4th 573, 593 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 653] [interrogatory answers]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2033.410, subd. (a) [responses to requests for admissions].) The record contains no discovery responses or other sworn statements from R.R. admitting that he intended that the post be taken as a threat. His declaration under penalty of perjury that he intended it as a joke therefore does not contradict anything he has previously stated under oath.\n\n*1239 The majority, however, finds \"self-contradiction\" in three different places: (1) in R.R.'s post, (2) in R.R.'s \"statements [in his declaration] about one-upmanship, peer pressure, and idiocy,\" and (3) in \"[t]he actions of [R.R.'s] parents.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1222.) The D'Amico rule cannot apply to the post, because it is an unsworn statement. The rule also cannot apply to the actions of R.R.'s parents, because they are unsworn, they are actions rather than statements, and they are not even R.R.'s actions (so they cannot possibly give rise to self-contradiction). But in addition to all of those dispositive problems, the more fundamental failing in the majority's argument is that none of the statements and conduct cited by the majority contradicts R.R.'s sworn declaration that he meant the post as a joke.\n\nThe majority contends, to the contrary, that this really is a matter of self-contradiction in sworn statements because \"[t]he material facts and inferences drawn from portions of R.R.'s and his father's declarations are inconsistent with the material facts and inferences drawn from other portions of the same declarations.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1223.) I disagree for two reasons. First, as a purely procedural matter, unsworn statements and conduct are not transformed into sworn statements merely by being quoted or described in a sworn declaration. R.R.'s post, for example, is an unsworn statement. It does not become a sworn statement merely because R.R. quoted and discussed it in his declaration.[5] The same point applies to R.R.'s parents' prelitigation conduct. Second, as a substantive matter, the insuperable obstacle again confronting the majority's reasoning is that there are no self-contradictions here at all.\n\nR.R.'s father does not contradict himself. He does not say, for example, both that he did and that he did not take R.R. to a psychiatrist, or that R.R. both has and lacks good character. Rather, R.R.'s father says that he took R.R. to a psychiatrist, and the majority infers that R.R.'s father believed R.R. intended the post to be taken as a genuine threat of violence, which according to the majority is \"inconsistent\" with the evidence R.R.'s father presents concerning R.R.'s good character. But there is absolutely no contradiction or inconsistency here, because the majority's inferences are not the only possible or reasonable inferences. It is perfectly consistent for R.R.'s father to maintain that (1) he took R.R. to a psychiatrist as a result of the post, but (2) he never believed R.R. meant the post to be taken as a genuine threat of violence, and (3) R.R. has engaged in conduct for years that indicates he is a person of good and nonviolent character who holds no negative attitudes towards homosexuals or homosexuality.\n\n*1240 The consistency is obvious. R.R.'s parents punished him and had him evaluated by a psychiatrist, but that does not necessarily mean they believed he intended the post to be interpreted as a genuine threat of violence. Rather, they may have been punishing him for making such an offensive and repulsive joke, and they may have consulted a psychiatrist to learn what could have led their son to make such an offensive and repulsive joke, so that they could \"insure that such conduct was never repeated and the root cause, if any, was dealt with immediately.\" None of this shows that they believed R.R. intended the post to be interpreted as a threat. Moreover, they might have been particularly surprised by R.R.'s having made such an offensive and repulsive joke because, to their knowledge, R.R. had never before \"engage[d] in inappropriate verbal behavior\" and, on the contrary, had generally exhibited exemplary behavior in the past. Again, there is absolutely no contradiction or inconsistency.\n\nSimilar analysis applies to the purported inconsistencies in R.R.'s declaration. The majority infers from R.R.'s \"statements about one-upmanship, peer pressure, and idiocy\" that R.R. intended his post to be interpreted as a threat (maj. opn., ante, at p. 1222), but no such inference is necessary. On the contrary, those statements are naturally and reasonably read as indicating the opposite. The declaration states that R.R. viewed the posts that preceded his as \"jesting,\" that he believed the authors of the posts were \"competing to see who could be the most outrageous,\" and that he \"decided to add [his] own message to the Internet graffiti contest that was apparently going on.\" The declaration later refers to \"one-upmanship\" and R.R.'s regrets about having allowed \"peer pressure\" to make him \"act[] like an idiot,\" but those statements refer back to the \"competing\" and \"contest\" that were described earlier in the declaration. They thus are fully consistent with R.R.'s \"statements about his jocular intent.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1222.) In effect, they confirm that he intended the post not as a threat but rather as an entry in a joke contest, which he idiotically entered as a result of the desire for peer approval. Here too, there is absolutely no contradiction or inconsistency.\n\nOn this score, the inferences that the majority draws from R.R.'s \"statements about one-upmanship, peer pressure, and idiocy\" merit careful scrutiny. First, the majority finds that R.R.'s statements \"suggest[] he succumbed to a `\"herd instinct.\"'\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1222, quoting Dailey v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. (1970) 2 Cal. 3d 741, 748 [87 Cal.Rptr. 376, 470 P.2d 360] (hereafter Dailey).) Next, the majority claims that the Supreme Court has equated the \"herd instinct\" with \"`the commonly known tendency of students to engage in aggressive and impulsive behavior which exposes them and their peers to the risk of serious physical harm.'\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1222, italics in maj. opn., quoting Dailey, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 748.) Putting it all together, the majority infers that R.R.'s statements about peer pressure show that he was driven by a herd instinct and hence was engaging *1241 in aggressive behavior that exposed his peers to serious physical harm, so he must have intended that his post be taken as a genuine threat of violence, which contradicts his own statements that he intended the post as a joke. (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1221-1222 [R.R.'s \"statements about one-upmanship, peer pressure, and idiocy imply\" that he \"intended that his message be interpreted as a threat\"].)\n\nThe majority's reasoning suffers from the following three defects, each of which is independently dispositive. First, the majority's own quotation from the Supreme Court, read in its entirety, demonstrates that the court did not equate the \"herd instinct\" with \"the commonly known tendency of students to engage in aggressive and impulsive behavior which exposes them and their peers to the risk of serious physical harm.\" (Dailey, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 748; see maj. opn., ante, at p. 1222.)\n\nSecond, if the majority wants to understand what R.R. meant by \"peer pressure,\" it need look no further than R.R.'s own declaration, which expressly (and correctly) defines it as \"the desire for peer approval.\" The desire for peer approval can lead people (young or old) to do all sorts of things (such as making offensive jokes) that have nothing whatsoever to do with violence, threats of violence, aggression, or risks of physical harm. Consequently, R.R.'s statement that he gave in to peer pressure has no tendency at all to show that he intended his post to be taken as a genuine threat of violence. It shows only that he was motivated by the desire for peer approval\u2014he wanted to impress his peers by entering a really offensive joke in the offensive joke contest that they were conducting.\n\nThird, even if the Supreme Court had equated the \"herd instinct\" with \"the commonly known tendency of students to engage in aggressive and impulsive behavior which exposes them and their peers to the risk of serious physical harm\" (which it did not), and even if R.R. meant to incorporate that definition when using the term \"peer pressure\" in his declaration (which he did not), that would still have no tendency to show that he intended his post to be taken as a genuine threat of violence, because the definition speaks of the tendency to engage in \"aggressive and impulsive behavior\" that creates a \"risk of serious physical harm.\" Impulsively chasing a soccer ball into the street, without first looking both ways for oncoming traffic, would be an example of this tendency. That is, the \"herd instinct\" (or \"peer pressure\"), so defined, does not necessarily have anything to do with aggressive, threatening, or violent intent.\n\nThe majority's \"herd instinct\" discussion, based on R.R.'s \"statements about one-upmanship, peer pressure, and idiocy,\" is the majority's sole basis for finding that R.R.'s declaration is self-contradictory, which in turn is the *1242 majority's basis for disregarding R.R.'s \"statements about his jocular intent.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1222.) In reality, there is no contradiction or inconsistency, and hence no self-contradiction, so the entire argument collapses.[6]\n\nAs support for its version of the self-contradiction theory, the majority does not cite D'Amico or cases applying it, or any California authorities at all. Instead, the majority cites a Ninth Circuit bankruptcy case and cases from Colorado, New York, Georgia, Wisconsin, Massachusetts (decided in 1939), and Indiana (decided in 1916). (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1223.) Those authorities, whether taken separately or together, are inadequate to establish a point of California procedural law.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the majority's self-contradiction analysis is erroneous and cannot support the majority's conclusion that defendants have failed to make a prima facie showing of constitutional protection under the subjective test. In short, the majority has not shown that R.R.'s post was an unprotected true threat, because the record contains evidence that, if believed by the trier of fact, would demonstrate that the post was not intended as a threat.\n\nIV. The Factual Context and the Objective Test\n\nUnder the objective test for true threats, the court must determine \"whether it is `reasonably foreseeable . . . to a speaker that the listener will seriously take his communication as an [expression of] intent to inflict bodily harm. This suffices to distinguish a \"true threat\" from speech that is merely frightening.'\" (Fogel v. Collins, supra, 531 F.3d at p. 831, quoting Planned Parenthood v. Amer. Coalition of Life (9th Cir. 2002) 290 F.3d 1058, 1076.) Applying that test, the majority finds that it was indeed reasonably foreseeable that R.R.'s post would be interpreted as an expression of intent to inflict bodily harm. Although I show below that the majority errs in concluding that the post was a true threat under the objective test, I emphasize that even if the majority were correct on this point, the failure of the majority's analysis under the subjective test would still be fatal to its decision.\n\nAlthough the majority acknowledges that \"[a]lleged threats should be considered in light of their entire factual context, including the surrounding *1243 events and reaction of the listeners\" (U.S. v. Orozco-Santillan (9th Cir. 1990) 903 F.2d 1262, 1265; see maj. opn., ante, at p. 1213), in applying the objective test for true threats, the majority focuses on the language of R.R.'s individual post and the reaction of D.C.'s parents. (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1219-1221.) When R.R.'s post is viewed in light of the entire factual context, however, it becomes clear that no reasonable person would have foreseen that it would be interpreted as a serious expression of intent to inflict bodily harm. At a minimum, applying the prima facie showing standard, the record contains evidence that is sufficient to sustain a ruling in defendants' favor. Thus, under the objective test, defendants should prevail.\n\nPlaintiffs' opposition to the special motion to strike included a declaration by plaintiffs' counsel, to which a number of exhibits were attached. The declaration describes one of the exhibits as \"a true and correct copy of sequential posts provided by [plaintiffs] to Harvard-Westlake.\" All of the quotations in the discussion below are taken from that exhibit, and all typographical and other errors are in the original. It should be emphasized at the outset that one need not find the posts funny, in good taste, or even excusable in order to recognize them as jokes and as protected speech.\n\nThe first post is from \"dozer\" and reads: \"i think you are very sexy and i like the way you distinguis between your midnight brown hair and your golden brown eyes. However, your hair is black. Everything at midnight looks black you fool. H.\" No reasonable person would believe that the author of the post meant to be expressing a genuine belief that D.C. was \"very sexy\" or that the author genuinely liked the way D.C.'s Web site distinguished between his \"midnight brown\" hair and his \"golden brown\" eyes. The post is mocking and farcical from start to finish. It is a joke, and no alternative interpretation is reasonable.\n\nThe next post is from \"dub\": \"like dub dozer has already said, i find you extremely good looking. your intro gets me off and you need to update your gallery so i have more pictures to jack off to . . . ill continue to visit this site every free period i have.\" The post is signed \"secret admirer\" and concludes \"P.S. I am a boy.\" This post is the first to introduce the theme of homosexuality, though it does not suggest that \"Danny Alexander\" is gay. Rather, the post mockingly indicates that \"Danny Alexander\" is very attractive, but to \"a boy.\" Again, it is obviously a joke.\n\nThe next post is from \"Hoostain\": \"You are so gosh darn hot! Please meet me on the corner of sunset and bellagio at 1:34 a.m. tonight. You look so great in your pictures by the way. Call me [phone number omitted]. SEXY!!!!\" The post is signed \"that guy that hates you.\" Next, from \"yourgay@aol.com\": \"you are a total fag, how does that cock feel in your *1244 butt.\" Next, from \"HW Student\": \"Everyone knows about this webpage and were never going to live it down AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHSAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\"\n\nBy this point, the running joke has changed from the suggestion that men are sexually attracted to \"Danny Alexander\" to the suggestion that \"Danny Alexander\" is attracted to men. Again, all of the posts are obviously just jokes making fun of \"Danny Alexander.\" No reasonable person would believe, for example, that \"Hoostain\" (also known as \"that guy that hates you\") was seriously proposing a rendezvous at Sunset and Bellagio. Nor would a reasonable person conclude that \"that guy that hates you\" really hates D.C. The entire thread of posts is obviously a farce.[7]\n\nOne could reasonably conclude from just those first five posts, however, that at least some of the authors were Harvard-Westlake students. The second post appears to be from a student (\"every free period i have\"), and the fifth purports to be from \"HW Student\" and says \"Everyone\" (presumably everyone at school) \"knows about this.\" At a minimum, the authors of the posts knew that \"Danny Alexander\" was somehow connected with Harvard-Westlake, and anyone who knew that D.C. was a student there would reasonably infer that the authors of the posts were students there as well. That is indeed the inference that D.C.'s parents correctly drew\u2014they contacted the school the day after discovering the posts on D.C.'s Web site.\n\nThe next post is from \"Hairy Back of the Legs Man\" and reads: \"Oh my god! OHHHHHHHHHHH! You are so fucking orgasmic. I'm wet . . . oops i peed my pants. You look exactly like Britney! EXACTLY! Your career is bound to go NOWHERE . . . but up A BUTT! In conclusion, you suck nuts. Have a fruity.\" After a brief and unintelligible post, the next is from \"penewanker\": \"I am just stunned at how well you have been doing [D.C.]. I can't wait until your first hit single comes out in whenever. I have always known since the day your mom and dad had sex that you or they would be a star. Obviously . . . I was wrong but I still hope you can keep it on the FREAKY SIDE![8] You got what it takes girlfriend . . . shoot your stuff at the world.\"\n\nAgain, the farcical nature of these posts hardly needs to be pointed out. No reasonable reader could have interpreted them as anything but jokes.\n\n*1245 After two inconsequential posts, the next is from \"Fuck You Queer Bitch\": \"Is this kid for serious . . . you take it in the ass just about every minute of every day. Your music sucks and you eat the big wang. Next feature film by this kid is gonna be a gay porno.\" Next, from \"you eat weiner\": \"BOYS!!! THAT is what you like. i don't get it man . . . on ur website, it says ur name is Danny Alexander, but i thought it was Fruity McGayGay? oh yeah, did i say you like boy penis?\" Next, from \"You Love Cock\": \"You are the biggest fag in the hw class of 06 exept for [names omitted], or so we thought. . . . this definetly puts u over the top as undeniabley the biggest cocksucker at hw maybe in the schools history, thank you though . . this will give everyone laguhs for a long long time [D.C.], you're the man (that likes men).\" Next, from \"[D.C.]smokespole@hotmail.com\": \"[D.C.], I really enjoy all of your work. You are an inspiration to all and your lyrics are truely amazing. Your loose caboose accounts for your mastry of sword swallowing. I think you should change your name from danny alexander to meat-pole tarzan because you are a man who understands the needs of a man,\" signed \"Fuck you in your fucking fuckhole, me.\"\n\nUp to this point, there is no denying that all of the posts, however unfunny, sophomoric, and repulsive, are nothing but farce. The next post, from \"Disturbed Senior,\" steps up the level of nastiness: \"Hey [D.C.], i was reading some of these posts, and it looks like your off to a great start as far as collecting a fan club goes, your career is going really well . . . anyways i did some research and the bridge that goes over the 405[9] just below mulholland gives you enough height to make a it a quick and nearly painless death . . . i really hope things work out for you . . .\" Two more posts follow, from \"I HATE FAGS,\" which simply repeat the words \"HEY FUCKER\" and \"YOU ARE REAL GAY.\"\n\nThe next post, from \"DAN JUSTICE,\" is the first to raise the rhetoric to a level that could, when considered out of context, be construed as a threat. It says \"HEY [D.C.], I KNOW A GOOD FAG WHEN I SEE ONE. I LIKE WHAT I SEE, LET'S GO GET SOME COFFEE. faggot im gonna kill you\" and is signed \"H-W student.\"\n\nThere is no question that the words \"faggot i[']m gonna kill you,\" when considered in isolation, are threatening. But one could say the same thing about the words of the defendant in Watts v. United States (1969) 394 U.S. 705 [22 L.Ed.2d 664, 89 S.Ct. 1399], who was convicted of threatening the life of the President of the United States with the words: \"`If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L. B. J.'\" (Id. at p. 706.) The Supreme Court concluded, however, that the statement was mere *1246 \"political hyperbole,\" particularly when considered in light of \"the reaction of the listeners,\" all of whom \"laughed after the statement was made.\" (Id. at pp. 708, 707.)\n\nSo how did the audience react to the purported threat from \"DAN JUSTICE\"? The posts quoted so far indicate that at least some of the authors had read prior posts before writing their own, and later posts confirm that pattern. Moreover, any number of other Harvard-Westlake students who did not post might nonetheless have been reading the thread of posts. How did they all react? Not one of them posted any message of alarm concerning the post. No one said \"Did you see that death threat? Somebody better warn [D.C.],\" or anything of the kind. Similarly, the record contains no evidence that any Harvard-Westlake students contacted the school's administration to alert them to the purported death threat, even though the thread of posts was obviously being read and at least partially written by Harvard-Westlake students, and even though \"DAN JUSTICE\" himself (or herself) signed the post \"H-W student.\" Indeed, as noted already, the connection between the posts and Harvard-Westlake students was sufficiently obvious that D.C.'s parents contacted the school the day after discovering the posts. But no one who actually participated in the thread of posts ever manifested any concern that any of the threatening language might be serious. In short, there is no evidence that any writers of any of the posts, or any readers other than D.C.'s parents (and the purported expert witness they have retained in this litigation[10]), perceived it as a genuine threat. Everyone could tell it was a joke\u2014tasteless, repulsive, and not at all funny, but still a joke.\n\nAccordingly, rather than manifesting any kind of shock, alarm, or even concern, the posts following the one by \"DAN JUSTICE\" continued the farcical and jesting approach of their predecessors. The next is from \"body\": \"Dear [D.C], Hi!!! im the representative for the student body at harvard westlake, and on behalf of my fellow classmates, I personally feel that it is my duty to tell you how i respond to your life. You, my friend, just might fall under the category of highly unstraight. Not only are you a massive fagmo, but must absolutely quit showing your face at my school. You are now officially wanted dead or alive, and when we find you, we will pounce on that like ur [name omitted]. Bottom line is that you need to be stopped, and if you resist, i will personally unleash my manseed in those golden brown eyes that you value so greatly. I hope you take what I say with the highest regard, and I am looking forward to your death. Thanks.\" Again, certain hyperbolic *1247 themes are sounded (\"quit showing your face at my school,\" \"wanted dead or alive,\" \"I am looking forward to your death\"), but the post as a whole makes it clear that it is all a joke. The author is obviously not writing as a representative of the Harvard-Westlake student body and, for example, does not really intend to \"unleash [his] manseed\" in anyone's eyes if \"Danny Alexander\" fails \"to be stopped.\" The entire post, however repellant and unfunny, is mere juvenile mockery and absurd rhetoric. Again, no one (other than D.C.'s parents) appeared concerned or alarmed.\n\nThe next post purported to be from a woman and states \"[D.C.], youre the shit, keep drawing scratch board pics of me in art class . . love you.\" Next, from \"Music Pro\": \"Hey [D.C.], I'd say by the looks of it, all those `fag' posts were written by the same pitifully untalented pimply-faced loser blow-hole and that you should not let it (meaning the asshole) bother you in the least. Just keep on doing your thing and let the jealous losers rant. He is obviously wishing he had your talent and craving a little man meat himself.\" Now the joke has gone from (1) men find \"Danny Alexander\" attractive, to (2) \"Danny Alexander\" is gay, to (3) the people who are criticizing \"Danny Alexander\" are gay (and jealous of his talent).\n\nThe next four posts all appear to be parodies of fan mail. From \"Kandy Kane\": \"Hi [D.C.]! UR the best! So KOOOL. My friend & I luv ur voice. I so totally don't think you look gay cuz ur so KUTE! UR like one of my favorite singers! Along with Justin, of course. Love, Kandy.\" From \"Mandy\": \"Hi [D.C.]! I saw you on your disney tour! I can't wait for your next movie to come out. Is is gonna be in real live theatres? Im gonna buy it on video when it comes out. I hope you like hollywood. Maybe Ill move there somedday and be a singer too. I love to sing. Maybe you could give me some ttips one day. Say hi to the boy from sleepover for me. He is really dreamy. but not as dreamy a syou. I love uyou [D.C.]. love mandy (p.s. Is alexander your middle name or your last name? if its your middle name would you please tell me your last name?)\" From \"eLiZaBeTh\": \"I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU.\" From \"MEGHAN\": \"FREADYSIDE IS MY FAVORITE SONG EVEERRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!! i LOVE YOU! I REALLY HOPE YOU ARENT REALLY GAY I DONT THINK YOU ARE BUT I THINK YOUR THE BEST. i AGREEE WEITH MANDY I CNAT WAIT FOR YOUR MOVIE TO COME OUT I LOVE YOU I LOVEYOU I LOVE YOU AND I ALSO AGREE WITH THE OTHER PERSOIN WHO SAID THAT ONE GUY WHO SAID ALL THOSE MEAN THINGS IS JEALOUS. IT CANT BE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE BECAUSE TEY ALL SOUND THE SAME HES SO STUPID DONT LET IT GET TO YOU AT LEAST I LOVE YOU AND A LOT OF MY FFREINDS LIKE YOU A LOT TOO. \\I LOVE YOU DISNEY IS SO SMART FOR RECONGINZING YOUR TALENT YOUR SO COOL LOVE LOVE LOOVE YOU [D.C.]\"\n\n*1248 The next post continues the theme of mockery through feigned admiration: \"seriously [D.C.], you are such an amazing and talented person. i love you so much and when you get sick of singing and acting you should be an artist because you are unbelievable at that too. especially scratch board pictures of [name omitted] and large breasted prostitutes.;-) this weekend we're chilling for sure. love, [name omitted].\"\n\nThen, at last, comes a post from an author identified only as \"Person,\" who we now know was R.R.: \"Hey [D.C.], I want to rip out your fucking heart and feed it to you. I heard your song while driving my kid to school and from that moment on I've . . . wanted to kill you. If I ever see you I'm . . . going to pound your head in with an ice pick. Fuck you, you dick-riding penis lover. I hope you burn in hell.\" Like most of the earlier posts, this one is vulgar and repulsive. Although it echoes the purportedly threatening themes found in some earlier posts, it also resembles its predecessors in that it was not reasonably foreseeable that the post would be taken seriously. The author of the post purports to be a father who has wanted to kill \"Danny Alexander\" ever since hearing his song on the radio. The majority agrees that it would be unreasonable to interpret the post as a genuine threat motivated by dislike of the song, but the majority fails to explain how any interpretation of the post as a genuine threat could be reasonable, given the context in which it occurred.\n\nNo subsequent posts manifest any concern or alarm about the purportedly threatening character of R.R.'s post. Again, there is no evidence that anyone (other than D.C.'s parents) thought it necessary to alert the school or the police that D.C. might be in danger. Instead, the posts continue in exactly the same manner as before, joking and making fun of \"Danny Alexander.\"\n\nThe next post is from \"G-miK\": \"Your worse than Won-G . . . . you don't have a music video with hot bitches you probably made this site yourself you dont have golden or midnight bullshit eyes it seems like your growing a white-man afro . . . pukeen me salat! (translation: nigga plz!) your juss a silly lil cracka that needs a couple bullets in the chest 50-cent style go eat cock.\" The next post, from \"anonymous-G,\" continues in a similar vein: \"correction pukeen me salat is toss my salad niega pagousta = nigga please but ur still a faggot . . . . i like that call me [phone number omitted] P.S i am a man.\"\n\nThe immediately following posts confirm the complete and incessant lack of seriousness shown throughout the thread of posts. The next post is from \"hoo flung pu\": \"hello sir. i am from the hw gay-straight alliance, and we were wondering where you were on the club day? you didnt sign up like last year . . . were you singing? you have a lovely voice. were you acting? your midnight brown hair is so captivating . . . We missed you! well we all wanted *1249 to know, are you still taking [male name omitted] to semiformal? you two make such a delicious combo! delicious like cock in your mouth, boy. my beard is longer than your dick. asian guys be walkin around like `DAMN HE HAS A SMALL PENIS'.\"\n\nNext, from \"Sorry\": \"[D.C.], I am that guy who made all of these hate posts. I now realize after reading Music Pro and meghan's posts that i am just a fat, pimply looser craving the cock mystef. So, with that i wanted to say i'm sorry; sorry you're such a boner-biting brown-clown. You are a highly revered flagpole sitter for the balogne cavalry. You are a rump-ranger, uphill gardener, ring-raider, anal pressure washer, cum dumpster. You always enjoy getting a clap from the back row. Hope you continue to put the shmock on your cock cuz you don't want to get those speed bumps. P.S. Call me for a nice little game i call hide the meat in the fridge P.P.S. These posts are all from different people.\"\n\nThe next post, from \"cell phone addiction,\" makes fun of D.C. for allegedly being \"Glued to [his] cell phone\" and also reveals his real name. The next is from \"crazed fan\" and consists of over-the-top adoration (\"ive always loved your work,\" etc.) punctuated with parenthetical accusations of homosexuality and expressions of hostility (\"you are an oversized faggot\" and \"i just want to hit you in the neck . . . hard,\" etc.). The next, from \"A Secret Admirer\" likewise mocks D.C.'s cell phone use. The next post says merely \"you damn democrat!\"\n\nThe next, from \"hw,\" appears to be a piece of sincere encouragement: \"dear [D.C.], i just wanted to say that dont listen to anything that these mean kids at our school are writing. you are one of the sweetest boys at school and its really cool that you are goign after your dreams. the best of luck to you!\" Again, it is noteworthy that even this (apparently) sympathetic author, who had clearly read the earlier posts, showed no alarm or concern regarding the putative threats they contained and did not contact the Harvard-Westlake administration or the police to warn them about any danger to D.C.\n\nThe next post, from \"yo,\" returned to the mockery and taunting: \"nope dont listen to her [D.C.] end it now.\" The next post is from \"God\": \"[D.C.], this isn't why I created man. Stop ruining my plan, gayass.\" A later post, from \"Mr. Manager,\" purported to be from \"Danny Alexander's\" manager, who claimed to be tired of lying about how good \"Danny's\" voice is. Another post purported to be from \"Clive Davis\" (a legendary figure in the popular music industry), claiming he wanted to sign \"Danny Alexander\" and asking for a callback at \"(213) You-Are-Totally-Fucking-Gay.\" The final post on the printout is from \"Ky Jelly Representative\": \"Hey [D.C.], im so excited to finally speak to you. We here at Ky Jelly we wanted to know if would be the *1250 spokesperson for our new anal lube. You obvisouly get fucked in the ass more than anyone else on earth. So who better to be a spokesperson than you. fucking ass clown. nigga what?\"\n\nReading the sequence of posts from beginning to end, no reasonable person would foresee that any of it would be taken as a serious threat of violence. No reasonable person would believe that (at least) four people were sincerely threatening to take D.C.'s life. Taken together, all of the posts amount to nothing but a lot of adolescent sex-obsessed hyperbolic derision, sarcasm, and repulsive foolishness\u2014\"Your music is sooo good and I love you sooo much,\" \"You're a really attractive guy\u2014to boys!,\" \"You're gay,\" \"No, the people who are calling you gay are gay,\" \"You have a small penis,\" and so forth. Even the authors of sympathetic posts, like \"hw\" and \"Music Pro,\" did not manifest any belief that D.C. might actually be in peril. Rather, they merely advised him to ignore the mockery (\"dont listen to anything that these mean kids at our school are writing\"). Again, there is no evidence that anyone but D.C.'s parents contacted the school's administration or the police to warn of any potential danger to D.C.\n\nIndeed, the record contains evidence that D.C. himself did not take any of the posts seriously. A declaration submitted in support of an anti-SLAPP motion filed by a different defendant states that D.C. \"has been in Los Angeles openly socializing with friends in Westwood\" and that D.C. admitted to a friend \"that he was not traumatized by the incident and . . . thought that his father was crazy for making a big deal of the episode when he didn't care.\" Viewing R.R.'s post in the entire factual context, including the reaction of the entire audience, no reasonable person could have foreseen that the post would have been taken as a serious expression of intent to commit an unlawful act of violence. It was just one more vile joke in a string of vile jokes.\n\nThe majority's analysis fails to support a contrary conclusion. The first part of the majority's analysis dwells exclusively on the language of the post itself, ignoring the context. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1219.) No rebuttal of that analysis is necessary, because the majority concedes that \"[a]lleged threats should be considered in light of their entire factual context, including the surrounding events and reaction of the listeners.\" (U.S. v. Orozco-Santillan, supra, 903 F.2d at p. 1265; see maj. opn., ante, at p. 1213.)\n\nNext, the majority relies on D.C.'s father's reaction to the posts as evidence that R.R.'s post constituted a true threat, but such reliance is misplaced. The majority mentions that D.C.'s father shut down the Web site and contacted the police, who in turn advised him to keep D.C. out of school until an investigation was completed. First, the evidence does not reveal *1251 precisely what the father told the police that prompted their recommendation. Second, the police later concluded that the posts, including R.R.'s, did not constitute genuine threats.[11] D.C.'s parents allowed D.C. to return to Harvard-Westlake for only one class before withdrawing him from the school and enrolling him in a school in Northern California, to which the entire family then moved. The majority says D.C.'s parents took such drastic measures only \"[w]hen the police investigation dragged on\" (maj. opn., ante, at p. 1220), but D.C.'s father's own declaration states that they enrolled D.C. in his new school just one week after informing Harvard-Westlake and the police about the posts\u2014D.C.'s father reported the posts on October 8, and D.C. was enrolled in his new school in Northern California on October 15. The majority also mentions that \"D.C.'s father had to travel back and forth from the family's new residence to Los Angeles for business purposes.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1220.) D.C.'s father's overreaction to the post does not change it from a bad joke into a true threat, however, and the hardships borne by D.C.'s father are not relevant to the true threat analysis.\n\nRegarding the rest of the factual context, the majority argues that although \"the majority of posts may have been nonthreatening,\" that \"does not lessen the effect of R.R.'s post,\" because \"[t]he law did not obligate plaintiffs to view all of the posts as having the same purpose or intent.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1220.)[12] Also, according to the majority, \"that students other than R.R. found the posts as a whole to be funny or amusing does not suggest how plaintiffs should have viewed R.R.'s post in particular.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1220.) The objective test, however, has nothing to do with how plaintiffs should have viewed (or were \"obligate[d]\" to view) R.R.'s post. Rather, the test asks whether a reasonable person, considering R.R.'s post in its entire factual context, would foresee that it would be interpreted as a serious threat of violence. Moreover, the other posts are relevant not just because most of *1252 them are, even when considered out of context, unambiguously nonthreatening. They are also relevant because they show that no one involved in the thread of posts viewed R.R.'s post as a serious threat.\n\nAs the majority recognizes and the case law reflects, the law requires this court to consider R.R.'s post in its full factual context, including the reaction of the audience, in determining whether the communication was a true threat under the objective test. (See, e.g., U.S. v. Orozco-Santillan, supra, 903 F.2d at p. 1265.) The majority's own analysis implicitly adopts that approach by inferring from the reaction of D.C.'s parents that it was reasonably foreseeable that R.R.'s post would be taken as a threat. That analysis, however, neglects both the content of the other posts and the reaction of everyone who read them (other than D.C.'s parents). When viewed in light of the entire context (as it must be), R.R.'s post appears as just one more link in a chain of vulgar, adolescent rants, and no one but D.C.'s parents appears to have had any trouble figuring that out. No reasonable person would have foreseen that the post would be taken as a genuine threat, and the extreme reaction of D.C.'s parents (pulling their son out of school and enrolling him in a different school hundreds of miles away, just one week after discovering the posts), which D.C. himself described as \"crazy,\" does not constitute evidence to the contrary.\n\nMoreover, the majority at most succeeds in showing that the record contains evidence that, if credited, would be sufficient to sustain a ruling in plaintiffs' favor on the issue. That would mean that plaintiffs have made a prima facie showing that R.R.'s post is not protected, but it would not mean that defendants have failed to make a prima facie showing that the post is protected. The central point is that, under the prima facie showing standard, it does not matter whether the record contains some evidence that might support the conclusion that the speech is unprotected. Defendants do not need to prove that the speech is protected as a matter of law. (Navellier v. Sletten, supra, 29 Cal.4th at pp. 94-95; Soukup, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 286.) Rather, they need only make a prima facie showing of constitutional protection. The presence in the record of evidence that might support a contrary inference does not mean they have failed to carry that burden, and consideration of the entire factual context shows that they have carried it. And again, plaintiffs expressly concede that \"[a]s to each of the elements of a `true threat' . . . there is here conflicting evidence.\"[13]\n\n*1253 The record contains evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that it was not reasonably foreseeable that R.R.'s post would be taken as a serious expression of intent to inflict bodily harm. I therefore conclude that defendants have carried their burden of making a prima facie showing of constitutional protection under the objective test for true threats.\n\nV. Hate Crimes and Attorney's Fees\n\nToward the end of its free speech analysis, the majority explains the rationale for its decision as follows: A defendant who prevails on an anti-SLAPP motion is entitled to an award of attorney's fees, but \"[i]n a case alleging statutory hate crimes and related common law claims, the courts should ensure that the anti-SLAPP statute does not discourage victims from seeking relief.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1224.) Thus, according to the majority, in order to avoid deterring hate crime victims from seeking redress for their injuries, \"[i]n a case alleging statutory hate crimes\" the court should place a thumb on the scale against granting an anti-SLAPP motion and consequent award of attorney's fees. Moreover, according to the majority, a court \"in a case like this one\" should endeavor to make sure that the anti-SLAPP motion is denied at the first step of the analysis, so that the plaintiffs are not put to the \"`grossly unfair burdens'\" of showing that their claims are prima facie meritorious. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1224, quoting Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal. 4th 299, 318 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 606, 139 P.3d 2] (hereafter Flatley).) I conclude that the majority's rationale fails on multiple levels.\n\nIt would make no sense to accord preferential treatment to every plaintiff who merely alleges a hate crimes claim, because anyone can allege any claim, including a hate crimes claim, regardless of whether the claim has any merit. Those who allege meritless claims, including hate crimes claims, do not deserve any special solicitude from the courts. On the contrary, the Legislature has provided that those who allege meritless claims targeting speech in connection with issues of public interest deserve to be stopped in their tracks and forced to pay their opponents' attorney's fees. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16.)\n\nPresumably aware that a rule of preferential treatment for every plaintiff who alleges a hate crimes claim would be insupportable, the majority *1254 qualifies its rationale in the following way: In \"a case like this one,\" where \"the communication at issue appears on its face to be an intentional threat of bodily harm and was reasonably interpreted as such by the recipient,\" the court's analysis at the first step of an anti-SLAPP motion should disregard evidence that the defendant's innocent intent made his speech constitutionally protected. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1224.) Thus, not every hate crime plaintiff is entitled to avoid the second step (at which point the plaintiff would be required to make a prima facie showing of merit) by having the court disregard the defendant's evidence of intent at the first step. Rather, that special protection is accorded only to plaintiffs like those in this case, because \"the communication at issue appears on its face to be an intentional threat of bodily harm and was reasonably interpreted as such by the recipient.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1224.)\n\nThe problem with the majority's approach is this: How does the majority know those conditions have been met? What standard of proof is being applied? To what evidence? Who has what burden?\n\nThe difficulties with the majority's approach become clearer if we consider each condition\u2014(1) \"the communication at issue appears on its face to be an intentional threat of bodily harm . . .\" and (2) the recipient \"reasonably interpreted\" it as a threat\u2014in more detail. Is the \"communication at issue\" being considered in context or out of context? The phrase \"on its face\" presumably means \"considered out of context,\" but why should a court be interested in considering the communication out of context? For purposes of interpreting purportedly threatening speech, context is everything. \"I'm going to kill you\" could be a death threat or a piece of friendly banter, depending on context. As a result, a plaintiff could easily base a frivolous hate crimes claim on a communication taken out of context. It is consequently impossible to understand why, before reaching even the first step of the analysis, a court should consider the communication out of context and then, if it appears to be a threat, use that as a basis to favor the plaintiff in the remainder of the analysis.[14]\n\nThe majority's approach to the second condition\u2014that the recipient \"reasonably interpreted\" the communication as a threat\u2014raises even more serious concerns. Putting aside the issue of reasonableness, which is ordinarily a question of fact (see, e.g., Smith v. Selma Community Hospital (2008)  164 Cal. App. 4th 1478, 1509 [80 Cal.Rptr.3d 745]), how does the majority know that D.C. interpreted R.R.'s post as a threat of bodily harm? The record *1255 contains no declaration from D.C., so how does the majority know? The majority cannot be relying on the allegations of the complaint, because, again, anyone can allege anything. The only other possible basis for the majority's conclusion is the declaration of D.C.'s father, who states that (1) apart from attending one class period, D.C. \"did not return to the school due to fear for his life,\" and (2) \"due to the threats . . . [D.C.] started to suffer from frequent and severe panic attacks which required medical attention, and from which he still suffers occasionally to this date.\" Although those statements might contain some ambiguity, they do seem to say that, according to D.C.'s father, D.C. believed his life was threatened. I will therefore assume the statements do mean D.C. interpreted the post as a threat, so they do constitute evidence that supports the majority's conclusion.\n\nThe problem is that the record contains contrary evidence as well. As already noted, the record contains a declaration stating that D.C. told a friend (identified by name) that \"he was not traumatized by the incident and . . . thought that his father was crazy for making a big deal of the episode when he didn't care.\" (Italics omitted.) Those statements might contain some ambiguity as well, but they do seem to say that D.C. did not believe his life was threatened.\n\nSo we have a conflict. According to D.C.'s father, D.C. believed he was threatened. According to a friend of D.C.'s (identified by name), D.C. said he did not believe he was threatened. Faced with that conflict, the majority concludes that D.C. did in fact interpret R.R.'s post as a threat. And that is the majority's rationale for disregarding, at the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis, R.R.'s evidence concerning his intent. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1224.) The bottom line is that the majority believes D.C.'s father, so the majority reasons that it need not take seriously what R.R. says.\n\nAs the foregoing discussion illustrates, the source of the difficulties with the majority's approach is that the majority is engaging in a partial evaluation of the merits before even getting to the first step of the analysis. The majority concludes that the post \"appears on its face to be an intentional threat of bodily harm\" (a merits issue) and \"was reasonably interpreted as such by the recipient\" (also a merits issue), and the majority then relies on those conclusions to shape its analysis of the first step by disregarding R.R.'s evidence of his intent. But that approach turns the well-established procedure for analyzing anti-SLAPP motions on its head, because the evaluation of the merits of the plaintiff's claims is supposed to take place at the second step, not at the first (or before the first). (See, e.g., Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal. 4th 53, 67 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 507, 52 P.3d 685].) Moreover, the merits evaluation that is conducted at the second step is itself subject to well-established rules\u2014the plaintiff has the burden of introducing *1256 evidence that, if credited, would be sufficient to support a favorable judgment. (See, e.g., Taus v. Loftus, supra, 40 Cal.4th at pp. 713-714.) For the majority's pre-first-step partial evaluation of the merits in an alleged hate crimes case, however, there are no such well-defined procedural constraints.\n\nOne final observation concerning the majority's discussion of its rationale: In explaining the purportedly undesirable consequences of taking seriously the defendant's evidence of intent \"in a case like this one,\" the majority quotes the Supreme Court as stating that to require a plaintiff, this early in the litigation, to make a prima facie showing of merit would constitute \"`grossly unfair burdens to impose on a plaintiff who is himself the victim of the defendant's [wrongful] activity.'\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1224, alteration in maj. opn., quoting Flatley, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 318.) The quotation, however, is from Flatley, in which the Supreme Court explained that it would be \"grossly unfair\" to force the plaintiff, early in the litigation, to make a showing of prima facie merit if the conceded or conclusively established facts already showed the defendant's conduct was illegal as a matter of law. (Flatley, supra, 39 Cal.4th at pp. 317-318, 320.) The Supreme Court never suggested that the burdens imposed at the second step of the anti-SLAPP analysis would be grossly unfair\u2014or unfair at all\u2014in any other circumstance. The majority's quotation from Flatley in this context thus strongly suggests that, before reaching the first step of the analysis, the majority has assumed that R.R.'s conduct was unlawful and, hence, that plaintiffs' claims have (at least partial) merit.[15]\n\nI conclude that the majority's rationale for its approach does not succeed. A merely alleged hate crimes claim cannot possibly serve as a basis to alter the analysis in plaintiffs' favor, and any evaluation of the claim's merits should take place at the second step, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly held. In sum, defendants' anti-SLAPP motion should stand or fall on its intrinsic merits, not on the basis of procedural shortcuts created by the judiciary to favor certain types of claims.\n\n*1257 VI. Speech in Connection with an Issue of Public Interest\n\nThe majority concludes that defendants have also failed to show that R.R.'s post was in connection with an issue of public interest. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1226.) Again, I disagree.\n\nAs the majority acknowledges, the anti-SLAPP statute expressly provides that it \"shall be construed broadly.\" (Code. Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16, subd. (a); see also Nyg\u00e5rd, Inc. v. Uusi-Kerttula (2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 1027, 1039-1042 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 210] (hereafter Nyg\u00e5rd); Sipple v. Foundation for Nat. Progress (1999) 71 Cal. App. 4th 226, 236 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 677].) In keeping with that statutory command, the case law sets an extremely low threshold for meeting the requirement that the speech be in connection with an issue of public interest. For purposes of the statute, an issue of public interest is \"any issue in which the public is interested.\" (Nyg\u00e5rd, supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at p. 1042.) \"In other words, the issue need not be `significant' to be protected by the anti-SLAPP statute\u2014it is enough that it is one in which the public takes an interest.\" (Ibid.) As a result, issues of public interest include matters that could be described as mere \"`celebrity gossip'\" or \"`tabloid' issues.\" (Id. at pp. 1039, 1042.) As the majority also acknowledges, \"[a] public issue is implicated if the subject of the statement or activity underlying the claim . . . was a person or entity in the public eye ....\" (Jewett v. Capital One Bank (2003)  113 Cal. App. 4th 805, 814 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 675]; see maj. opn., ante, at p. 1226.)\n\nTwo cases illustrate the point. In Seelig v. Infinity Broadcasting Corp. (2002) 97 Cal. App. 4th 798 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 108] (hereafter Seelig), the plaintiff had been one of 50 contestants on the television show Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire. (Id. at p. 801.) \"During her time on air, she stated only her name, that she was from San Francisco, and that she worked in sales at KFRC, a San Francisco radio station. Her total participation in the television broadcast lasted less than one minute.\" (Ibid., fn. omitted.) The hosts and producer of a morning radio show made derisive comments about the plaintiff, who then sued. (Id. at pp. 802-806.) The Court of Appeal concluded that the plaintiff, by participating in the television show, had \"voluntarily subjected herself to inevitable scrutiny and potential ridicule by the public and the media.\" (Id. at p. 808.) Because \"[t]he offending comments arose in the context of an on-air discussion . . . about a television show of significant interest to the public and the media,\" the comments were in connection with an issue of public interest. (Id. at pp. 807-808.)\n\nSimilarly, in Hall v. Time Warner, Inc. (2007) 153 Cal. App. 4th 1337 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 798] (hereafter Hall), the plaintiff was the elderly former housekeeper of Marlon Brando. (Id. at p. 1342.) When Brando died and reports *1258 revealed that he had named the plaintiff in his will, a reporter for the television show Celebrity Justice visited her (she resided in a retirement home and \"had been suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease for several years\") and videotaped an interview with her, part of which was included in a segment broadcast that evening. (Ibid.) The entire segment lasted \"approximately three minutes.\" (Ibid.) Because \"[t]he public's fascination with Brando and widespread public interest in his personal life made Brando's decisions concerning the distribution of his assets a public issue or an issue of public interest,\" the plaintiff \"became involved in an issue of public interest by virtue of being named in Brando's will.\" (Id. at p. 1347.)\n\nGiven that legal background, the majority's analysis of whether R.R.'s post was in connection with an issue of public interest is not easy to understand. The majority concedes that according to plaintiffs themselves \"D.C. had a record album with a planned release date, had broadcast a song worldwide via satellite radio, and had played the leading role in a feature film presented at an internationally acclaimed film festival. He also toured under the auspices of a nationally recognized radio network.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1229.) But the majority nonetheless concludes that \"[t]here is no evidence that [D.C.] was a nationally known singer or actor even under his pseudonym, Danny Alexander.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1229.) There are two problems with that claim. First, the facts just described do constitute circumstantial evidence that D.C. was a nationally (and perhaps internationally) known singer or actor. Second, the majority is again holding defendants to an incorrect legal standard\u2014there is no requirement that in order for a communication to be in connection with an issue of public concern, the subject of the communication must be nationally known. Rather, as the majority elsewhere concedes, it is sufficient for the subject of the communication to be \"a person or entity in the public eye.\" (Jewett v. Capital One Bank, supra, 113 Cal.App.4th at p. 814; see maj. opn., ante, at p. 1226.) The evidence about D.C.'s accomplishments as a singer and actor shows that he was indeed a person in the public eye.\n\nFor identical reasons, the majority's observation that \"D.C. was no Brando\" (maj. opn., ante, at p. 1229) is of no consequence. The case law does not require that he be Brando. It requires only that he be a person in the public eye. Moreover, contrary to the majority's suggestion, R.R.'s admission that he knew nothing about D.C.'s involvement in singing and acting until he saw D.C.'s Web site is not evidence tending to show that D.C. was not a person in the public eye. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1229.) There are surely countless persons in the public eye of whom R.R. has never heard. D.C.'s accomplishments in the entertainment industry show that he is a person in the public eye, and R.R.'s previous ignorance of those accomplishments does not constitute evidence to the contrary.\n\n*1259 The majority adds that \"D.C.'s use of a Web site in pursuing an entertainment career did not, ipso facto, put him in the public eye.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1229.) I agree that the Web site did not, by itself, make D.C. a person in the public eye. Rather, the Web site merely added to the evidence that D.C. was a person in the public eye. It was not just a Web site (or MySpace or Facebook page) of a teenager who aspired to be an entertainer\u2014it was the Web site of a singer/actor who had played the leading role in a feature film presented at an internationally acclaimed film festival, who had toured under the auspices of a nationally recognized radio network, who had a song broadcast worldwide via satellite radio, and who had a record album with a planned release date.\n\nThe majority also claims that because R.R.'s post \"is devoid of any information about D.C.,\" it is not \"analogous to a magazine article that discusses a celebrity or to a television interview or radio show about a celebrity.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1230.) In a similar vein, the majority reasons that, according to R.R., his post \"was part of a joke played on D.C. by other teenagers,\" but if the post was indeed a joke then \"it did not implicate a public issue.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1229; see also maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1199, 1210.) The problem with both arguments is that a joke can be made in connection with an issue of public concern. That is, communications in connection with issues of public concern do not exclude jokes and are not limited to informative discussions in magazine articles or television or radio shows. If they were, Seelig might well have been decided differently\u2014it is not clear how calling someone a \"`big skank'\" (Seelig, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at pp. 803, 811) and ridiculing her for refusing to appear on a morning radio show provides information about her or is anything more than a mere joke targeting someone in the public eye. The majority's emphasis on the age of those involved here (\"teenagers\") is likewise of no moment. There is nothing legally or factually impossible about a teenager being \"a person . . . in the public eye\" (Jewett v. Capital One Bank, supra, 113 Cal.App.4th at p. 814) or engaging in speech (including jokes) in connection with an issue of public interest.\n\nThe majority offers no argument or explanation in support of its sweeping exclusion of jokes from the category of communications in connection with issues of public interest for purposes of California's anti-SLAPP statute. As authority, the majority cites a Seventh Circuit case, a New York federal district court case, and a Massachusetts case, none of which involved California law. (See maj. opn., ante, at p. 1229.) Those cases held, in different contexts and under different standards, that certain jokes were not about matters of public concern. (See Polish American Congress v. F.C.C. (7th Cir. 1975) 520 F.2d 1248, 1250, 1253-1256; Shub v. Westchester Community College (S.D.N.Y. 2008) 556 F. Supp. 2d 227, 244-246; Pereira v. Commissioner of Social Services (2000)  432 Mass. 251 [733 N.E.2d 112, 116 & *1260 fns. 8, 9, 118-119].) Those cases are irrelevant. Not every joke is in connection with an issue of public concern, but that does not mean that every joke is not in connection with an issue of public concern. Some jokes are (such as jokes about persons in the public eye), and some jokes are not (such as the purely private jokes in the cases cited by the majority). I conclude that there is no basis for the majority's holding that every joke, just because it is a joke, is not in connection with an issue of public concern (maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1199, 1210, 1229), a holding that is profoundly hostile to First Amendment rights.\n\nD.C. was a singer and actor who had achieved significant successes in both fields, making him much more of a person in the public eye than the plaintiff in Seelig. A joke or other communication about him is therefore in connection with an issue of public interest.\n\nThe majority states that \"[n]othing we have said will chill free speech\" because \"[t]he narrow question on appeal\" concerns only an anti-SLAPP motion, leaving open the possibility that, after a full trial on the merits, defendants will not \"be found liable on any of plaintiffs' causes of action.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1225.) The Legislature sees things differently. Before the anti-SLAPP statute was enacted, it was always possible for defendants to prevail on the merits at trial. But in enacting the anti-SLAPP statute, the Legislature found that the possibility of prevailing on the merits at trial was not good enough, because the burdens of defending meritless litigation were in fact having a chilling effect on speech in connection with issues of public interest. (See, e.g., Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal. 4th 180, 192 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 298, 106 P.3d 958]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16, subd. (a).) The Legislature enacted the anti-SLAPP statute to enable defendants to terminate such litigation early, thereby limiting defense costs and counteracting the chilling effect that those costs created. (See, e.g., Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 192.) It is therefore incorrect to say that because this is merely an anti-SLAPP case it will not \"chill free speech.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1225.)\n\nAs I have explained, the majority opinion alters the law in multiple ways\u2014forcing defendants to show their conduct is protected as a matter of law, creating new legal rules that allow courts to disregard defendants' evidence, and holding that jokes are not communications in connection with issues of public interest\u2014that drastically tilt the playing field against defendants who bring anti-SLAPP motions. In so doing, the majority has weakened the anti-SLAPP statute and thus strengthened the chilling effect that the statute was intended to curtail.\n\n*1261 For all of the foregoing reasons, I disagree with all of the majority's substantive conclusions. Defendants have made a prima facie showing that R.R.'s post was protected speech and was made in connection with an issue of public interest. I therefore dissent.\n\nNOTES\n\n[1] We express no view as to whether D.C.'s parents were proper parties to the hate crimes claim.\n\n[1] The cases developing and explaining the prima facie showing standard for purposes of an anti-SLAPP motion do so in the context of the second step of the analysis. (See, e.g., Soukup, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 291.) The case law is nonetheless uniform in holding that at both the first step and the second step only a prima facie showing is required. There is no reason\u2014and the majority provides none\u2014to believe that at the first step of the analysis of an anti-SLAPP motion \"prima facie showing\" means something different from what it means at the second step.\n\n[2] The majority's reasoning on this point is also based on the \"self-contradiction\" theory, which I discuss in part III, post.\n\n[3] For example, constitutional protection of speech often depends upon the intent of the speaker. As a result, the majority's opinion will often make it impossible for defendants to get past the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis because it will rarely, if ever, be possible to establish the speaker's intent as a matter of law.\n\n[4] In a later Ninth Circuit case in which the defendant was convicted of threatening the President of the United States, the court interpreted the relevant federal statute in terms of the objective test; the court did not reach the issue of whether the subjective test was constitutionally required, because the defendant did not raise any First Amendment issues. (U.S. v. Romo (9th Cir. 2005) 413 F.3d 1044, 1051, fn. 6.) As a result, subsequent Ninth Circuit cases have treated the issue as a matter of intracircuit conflict and have applied both the subjective test and the objective test. (See U.S. v. Stewart (9th Cir. 2005)  420 F.3d 1007, 1017-1018; Fogel v. Collins (9th Cir. 2008) 531 F.3d 824, 831.)\n\nI also note that the federal decisions have not always characterized Virginia v. Black accurately. The Seventh Circuit, for example states that the Supreme Court's \"plurality offered a new definition of true threats\" and then quotes the definition requiring that \"`the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence'\" and acts \"`with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.'\" (U.S. v. Parr (7th Cir. 2008)  545 F.3d 491, 499, italics omitted.) But that new definition was not offered by a mere plurality\u2014it appears in part III of Justice O'Connor's opinion and thus is part of the majority opinion of the Supreme Court. (See Virginia v. Black, supra, 538 U.S. at pp. 347, 359-360 [Justice O'Connor \"delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to parts I, II, and III\"].) Justice O'Connor's opinion was joined in its entirety by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Stevens and Breyer, and it was joined as to parts I through III by Justice Scalia. (Id. at p. 368 (conc. & dis. opn. of Scalia, J.) [\"I join Parts I-III of the Court's opinion.\"].) Parts I through III\u2014including their new definition of true threats\u2014are therefore the opinion of the court and binding on all state and lower federal courts.\n\n[5] To illustrate: R.R. has never executed a declaration stating \"I want to kill D.C. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\"\n\n[6] Both in its discussion of the subjective test and elsewhere, the majority relies on various factual claims about \"cyberbullying,\" which the majority has collected from various Web sites. (Maj. opn., ante, at pp. 1218, 1222.) No party has advanced the factual contentions on which the majority relies, no party has introduced the evidence (i.e., the Web sites) from which the majority derives those facts, no party has requested judicial notice of any of that material, and it is unlikely that it would be judicially noticeable even upon request. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 451, 452.)\n\n[7] I am not unmindful of the emotional harm that this kind of mockery can cause, particularly when done en masse by the target's schoolmates. The issue here, however, is not whether D.C. suffered emotional harm as a result of the posts. (Evidence in the record (see post) indicates that he did not.) The issue is whether a reasonable person would have anticipated that R.R.'s post would be interpreted as a genuine threat of violence.\n\n[8] Later posts appear to indicate this is a reference to a song by \"Danny Alexander\" entitled \"Freakyside\" (or \"On the Freaky Side\").\n\n[9] The \"405\" is a freeway in the Los Angeles area.\n\n[10] It is not clear that expert testimony would be admissible on this issue at all. The question of whether a reasonable person would interpret the post as a genuine threat is a quintessential jury question, and there is no reason to believe that plaintiffs' retained witness has any more expertise than the jurors concerning the manner in which a reasonable person would interpret the post.\n\n[11] The majority states that the conclusions reached by the police \"are not controlling under the true threat analysis.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1225.) Although the police's opinion that the post was protected speech is not controlling, it does constitute evidence that a reasonable person would not have thought the post was a genuine threat of violence.\n\n[12] After acknowledging that plaintiffs admit \"they perceived only six of the 34 derogatory posts as serious threats of bodily harm,\" the majority states that \"[a]ccordingly, plaintiffs sued only six students.\" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1220.) Plaintiffs, however, sued at least one student whose posts, according to D.C.'s father, \"do not look threatening,\" and D.C.'s father states that \"[s]ome of the postings including threats of violence still do not have identified authors.\" Also, in addition to the six named student defendants, plaintiffs sued \"STUDENT DOES 1 through 50\" and \"PARENT OF STUDENT DOES 1 through 100,\" and the complaint describes at length the discovery plaintiffs intend to conduct in order to identify everyone involved in the Web site incident. Thus, contrary to the majority's implication, plaintiffs did not sue only the people who (purportedly) threatened D.C. Plaintiffs sued everyone they could identify, including students who plaintiffs admit did not threaten anyone, and plaintiffs expressed the intention of using discovery to widen the net still further.\n\n[13] Some of plaintiffs' evidence might eventually turn out to be difficult to credit. For example, the majority relies on D.C.'s father's statements that \"after the postings people approached [D.C.] . . . and asked him about being gay\" and that \"[i]t was clear that others that read the posts believed the comments about his sexual orientation and felt concern for him and his safety.\" The declaration says nothing more about any of this, about who these \"people\" and \"others\" are, what they said, or how it was \"clear\" that they believed D.C. was gay and in danger. D.C.'s father's declaration also states that D.C. \"started to suffer from frequent and severe panic attacks.\" What is notably absent from the current record, however, is a declaration from D.C. himself. As already noted, the record contains a declaration indicating that D.C. has admitted he \"was not traumatized by the incident\" and \"thought that his father was crazy for making a big deal of the episode when he didn't care.\" (Italics omitted.) And it is difficult to believe that any reasonable person reading the posts on D.C.'s Web site could have taken them as serious, credible, or accurate reports of his sexual orientation.\n\n[14] I say that the majority does all of this \"before reaching even the first step\" because the majority relies on these conclusions\u2014that the communication on its face appears to be a threat and was interpreted as such by the recipient\u2014as the basis for its approach to the first step (namely, disregarding R.R.'s evidence concerning his intent).\n\n[15] In other ways, however, the majority opinion reflects recognition that Flatley does not apply here. Plaintiffs have argued both in the trial court and on appeal that defendants' anti-SLAPP motion should be denied under Flatley on the ground that the conceded or conclusively established facts show that R.R.'s post was illegal. If the majority agreed with that argument, then the majority's entire true threat analysis would be superfluous. But instead of agreeing with plaintiffs' argument, the majority never mentions it, presumably because the majority understands that the conceded and conclusively established facts do not show that R.R.'s post was illegal. As a result, the majority's own reasoning shows that Flatley and its remarks about \"grossly unfair burdens\" have nothing to do with this case.", "annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 53}, {"start":
