Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression.\r\n\r\n2.  Entitlement to total rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability (TDIU).\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAppellant represented by:\tHarold H. Hoffman III, Attorney\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nK. Hughes, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active military service from May 1973 to October 1976.\r\n\r\nThese matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2012 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO) in Portland, Oregon.  In December 2013, the Veteran testified at a videoconference hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  A transcript of that hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nIn March 2014, the Board issued a decision denying service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and major depression, and entitlement to a TDIU rating.  The Veteran appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In September 2014, the Court granted the Joint Motion for Partial Remand (Joint Motion); vacated that portion of the March 2014 Board decision which denied service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and major depression, and entitlement to a TDIU rating; and remanded the appeal to the Board for additional action consistent with the Joint Motion.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA will notify the appellant if further action is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he has PTSD and/or depression due to his service aboard a submarine, sleep-deprivation in service, \"hazing\", and a submarine drill.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's STRs were negative for any findings of, or treatment for, an acquired psychiatric disability or symptoms of such.  The STRs contain complaints of a lump in his breast (April 1974, May 1974), a headache (June 1974), back pain (June 1974), an ingrown toe nail (four visits in July 1976), congestion, sore throat (August 1976) low back pain (four visits in September 1976), and low back pain (October 1976).  The records are negative for any complaints of fatigue, or lack of sleep.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was assigned to Great Lakes, Illinois from July 1973 to October 1973.  He was assigned to the USS Albert David at some point in 1974.  He was assigned to the Naval Nuclear Power School at Mare Island, California from April 1974 to September 1974.  He was assigned to the NUCPWR (Nuclear Power) Plant Operator School at Idaho Falls, Idaho from October 1974 to April 1975.  He served about the USS Proteus from July 1975.  He served about the USS Theodore Roosevelt from approximately September 1975 to October 1976.  In October 1976, it was recommended that the Veteran not be reenlisted and that he be discharged for unsuitability (i.e. apathy, defective attitude, and inability to expend effort effectively).  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's enlisted performance record reflects that he had a professional performance rating of 3.6 in June 1974, and 3.4 in September 1974, April 1975, and July 1975, with a final trait average of 3.45.  He had a military behavior rating of 3.8 in June 1974, 3.6 in September 1974, 3.2 in April 1975, and 3.4 in July 1975, with a final trait average of 3.5.  He had a military appearance rating of 3.8 in June 1974, 3.6 in September 1974, and 3.4 in April 1975 and July 1975, with a final trait average of 3.55.  For adaptability, he had a 3.8 in June 1974, and 3.4 in September 1974, April 75, and July 1975, with a final trait average of 3.5. \r\n\r\nAn evaluation report for the period March 1974 to September 1974 reflects that the Veteran had low and declining performance, inconsistent effort, lackadaisical attitude on occasion, marginal motivation, and satisfactory military behavior.  The Board notes that this was prior to his service on a submarine and was while he was attending the Naval Nuclear Power School at Mare Island, California.\r\n\r\nAn evaluation report for a period ending in April 1975 reflects that the Veteran had completed prototype training and compared to other trainees of the same rate and experience, his rate of qualification progress was fair, his watch standing performance was fair, and his qualifications were good.\r\n\r\nA service record reflects that on July 21, 1976 and July 22, 1976, the Veteran failed to go at the time prescribed to his appointed place of duty.  Again, this was prior to his time aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nAnother service record reflects that on August 24, 1976, August 26, 1976, August 27, 1976, August 30, 1976, and September 3, 1976, the Veteran failed to go to the appointed places of duty.  \r\n\r\nAn August 1976 performance evaluation report reflects the following:\r\n\r\nSince reporting aboard, [the Veteran] has experienced problems adapting to the demanding job of operating a nuclear power plant.  He has been delinquent in both departmental and ship's qualification since reporting aboard.  [The Veteran] has shown very little effort in completing qualification even though he has been counselled by his supervisors numerous times.  When [the Veteran] was assigned the duty of divisional Repair Parts Petty Officer, constant supervision was necessary to ensure that assigned tasks were carried out.  [The Veteran] has demonstrated little initiative in directing others and his negative attitude has also been reflected toward the naval service.  [The Veteran] is an individual who desires isolation from others.  He has been observed and counseled many times about unproductive use of his time when he should have been working on his qualifications or supply duties.  [The Veteran] does not take pride in his personal appearance when in uniform and has to be constantly prodded to ensure he meets the minimum standard of dress and grooming.  [the Veteran] has a good knowledge of both written and oral English and he supports the goals of Equal Opportunity.  He is not recommended for advancement or for reenlistment. \r\n\r\nIt further reflects, as follows:\r\n\r\n[The Veteran] was prematurely relieved of his duties as Repair Parts Petty Officer due to his lack of responsibility.  [The Veteran] was also placed on a remedial study program to allow him to catchup on his qualification and become an effective member of the division.  [The Veteran] has made unsatisfactory progress in completing this study program.  [The Veteran] has consistently proven his unreliability by arriving late for duty numerous times.  Although he has received Commanding Officers' Non-Judicial Punishment for these infractions, and has been counselled, he continues to reject authority and go his own way.\r\n\r\nA September 1976 Department of the Navy memorandum reflects that the Veteran was recommended for disqualification from submarine duty.  It notes that the Veteran was absent for an inspection due to a lack of concern for his duties.  A few days later, he was late for quarters several times and missed a muster.  The report reflects that the Veteran had been given non-judicial punishment, but did not respond positively.  \r\n\r\nThe memorandum reflects that the Veteran had reported to the command in September 1975 from Nuclear Power training in Idaho Falls, after a three month assignment.  His performance at the School was noted to have been \"inconsistent, lackadaisical, and at best fair\".  Since reporting to the command, his performance \"declined from marginal to poor.\"  It reflects that the Veteran had been counseled numerous times for failure to complete training in submarines.  \r\n\r\nIn sum, the service personnel records reflect that the Veteran had performance and attitude problems for more than a year prior to discharge, and prior to his claimed in-service stressors of serving aboard a submarine.  Rather than reflect that the Veteran was overworked and solely responsible for certain aspects of his job as a parts repair personnel, it reflects that he was unproductive and needed constant supervision.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has asserted that in April 1976, he was in fear for his life due to a drill which he believed was an actual imminent collision with an enemy vessel.  A Defense Personal Records Information Retrieval System report in response to a request for a deck log review reflects the following information: \"We reviewed the March-May 1976 deck logs for the USS Theodore Roosevelt.  The deck logs reveal that the submarine was in a Guam dry-dock March 8-16, 1976 and underway for Special Operations with limited deck logs entries during the periods March 27-30, April 5-25, May 2-8, and May 10-31, 1976.  The deck logs do not document a no-notice collision alert drill during a combat patrol.\" \r\n\r\nA copy of the ship's deck log sheet reflects that on May 7, [1976] (three weeks after the Veteran's alleged drill), the Veteran had a 1/4 inch by 1/8th inch laceration in his forehead.  The prognosis was good and the treatment was a bandage and return to duty.  The deck log is negative for any loss of consciousness.  \r\n\r\nThe earliest clinical evidence of an acquired psychiatric disability is more than twenty years after separation from service. \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that, pursuant to the September 2014 Court Order granting the Joint Motion, further development is necessary prior to adjudication of the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and major depression, and entitlement to a TDIU rating.  \r\n\r\nThe clinical evidence of record, including the Veteran's December 2012 VA examination report, includes findings that the Veteran's depression predated service.  An earlier November 2011 VA examination report concluded that there \"does not appear to be a connection between his current psychological difficulties which are apparent and his service in the Navy...\"   \r\n\r\nIn a December 2014 Remand Argument, it is claimed that \"the Veteran's stressors are sufficiently traumatic, especially considering the Veteran's already delicate psychiatric constitution.\"  It is further claimed that \"in-service events aggravated a pre-service psychiatric condition that was not noted on the Veteran's military entrance examination.\"  \r\n\r\nUnder 38 U.S.C.A. � 1111, a Veteran is entitled to a presumption of soundness on entry in service as to any disability not noted on examination for enlistment; such presumption can be rebutted only by clear and unmistakable evidence.  A history of a pre-service injury, of itself, is not a notation of a disability on service entrance, and does not suffice to rebut the presumption of soundness in the face of a normal clinical evaluation on service entrance.  In addition, if the presumption of soundness is rebutted, the Veteran is entitled to a further presumption that the disability not noted on entry in (but manifested during) service was aggravated by service.  This presumption likewise can be rebutted only by clear and unmistakable evidence (of non-aggravation).\r\n\r\nThe presumption of soundness applies only where there is evidence that a disease or injury was not noted upon entry into service manifested or was incurred in service.  Once the presumption of soundness is applied, if the Secretary is unable to rebut the presumption, the disease or injury that manifested in service is deemed incurred in service, such that the second element of service connection is established.  At that point, however, a veteran still must establish that he has a current disability that is related to the in-service injury or disease.  This nexus determination is based on a weighing of the evidence by the preponderance of the evidence standard, with the benefit of the doubt given to the veteran.  It is error to apply the presumption of soundness without first addressing or finding whether the Veteran's psychiatric disability manifested in service.  See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 54-55 (2012)\r\n\r\nBecause the Veteran was clinically normal on May 1973 psychiatric evaluation for enlistment, he is entitled to a presumption of soundness on entry in service with respect to a psychiatric disorder if a psychiatric disorder was manifest during service.  An examination that addresses the etiology of the Veteran's current psychiatric disability taking into account the applicable legal presumptions is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe December 2014 Remand Argument notes that the Veteran's treatment records from D. S., LCSW (licensed clinical social worker), have not been obtained and provides the contact information for this clinician.  Further, the most recent VA treatment records available for review are dated in October 2012.  VA should obtain all relevant VA and private treatment records which could potentially be helpful in resolving the Veteran's claim.  See Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78, 81-82 (1990); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).\r\n\r\nThe claim of entitlement to a TDIU rating is inextricably intertwined with the matter of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD and major depression, and consideration of that issue must be deferred pending resolution of the service connection claim.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1.  Ask the appellant to identify all providers of mental health evaluation or treatment he has received, to include prior to his 1973 enlistment and after his 1976 separation from service and to provide all authorizations necessary for VA to obtain any private records of such evaluations and treatment that are not already associated with the record.  The attention of the RO is specifically directed to records from the D. S., LCSW.  All updated VA treatment records should also be obtained.  \r\n\r\n2.  Thereafter, the Veteran should be afforded a VA psychiatric examination.  The claims folder, including a copy of this remand, should be reviewed by the examiner, and the examination report should reflect that review.  All appropriate tests should be conducted.  The examiner must offer opinions to the following:\r\n\r\n(a) Please identify (by medical diagnosis) each psychiatric disability entity currently found, including whether the Veteran has depression and PTSD.  Specifically, does the Veteran meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD (including based on fear of hostile action)?  If so, please identify the stressor and symptoms supporting such diagnosis.  If PTSD is not diagnosed, indicate clearly what symptom(s) needed for such diagnosis is/are lacking.\r\n\r\n(b)  As to each currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder, please offer an opinion as to whether that disorder was manifest during service.  In doing so, please address whether any of the performance/disciplinary problems which the Veteran had in service represented symptoms of a current psychiatric disability. \r\n\r\n(c) If (and only if) a current psychiatric disorder was manifest during service, please offer an opinion as to whether is it clear and unmistakable (obvious, manifest, or undebatable) that the acquired psychiatric disorder that was present during service existed prior to active military service?  If it is determined that a psychiatric disorder did not exist prior to service, the examiner should reconcile such finding with the December 2012 VA examination report, which includes the finding that the Veteran's depression predated service.\r\n\r\n(d)  If the acquired psychiatric disorder existed prior to active military service, is it also clear and unmistakable (obvious, manifest, or undebatable) that such disorder was not aggravated during or by his active military service beyond the condition's natural progression?  Any clear and unmistakable (obvious, manifest, or undebatable) evidence which serves as the basis for any opinion must be specifically identified.\r\n\r\n(e)  If a current psychiatric disorder was not present during service then is it at least as likely as not (50 percent or greater probability) that the current psychiatric disorder is otherwise etiologically related to the Veteran's period of active service?  \r\n\r\n(f)  Do the diagnosed psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, prevent the Veteran from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation?\r\n\r\nThe opinions provided must specifically reflect consideration of the Veteran's military performance evaluations and his post service VA and private treatment records and examination reports.  The examiner must explain the rationale for all opinions in detail, citing to supporting clinical data and/or medical literature, as appropriate.  \r\n\r\n3.  Thereafter, readjudicate the claims, to include entitlement to a TDIU rating.  If any benefit sought on appeal remains denied, the Veteran and his attorney should be provided a supplemental statement of the case and afforded an opportunity to respond.  The case should be returned to the Board for appellate review.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).  This claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nMICHAEL MARTIN\r\nVeterans Law Judge, Board of Veterans' Appeals\r\n\r\nUnder 38 U.S.C.A. � 7252 (West 2014), only a decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals is appealable to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.

Taylor, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from May 1968 to June 1969.  He also had Reserve service with active duty for training (ACDUTRA) from March 1964 to September 1964.  \r\n\r\nThis matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a December 2011 and April 2012 rating decisions of the Salt Lake City, Utah, Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  \r\n\r\nThe psychiatric disorder claim, including PTSD, has been previously denied.  Generally, new and material evidence is generally required to reopen a previously denied claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5108 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.156(a).  Here, at the least, there is a liberalizing law as to PTSD claims concerning \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.\"  See 75 Fed. Reg. 39843-52 (July 13, 2010).  Thus, new and material evidence is not necessary to reach the merits of the claim.  See Spencer v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 283 (1993).  Additionally, new and material evidence was received with the time to appeal a December 2010 rating decision in the form of a July 2011 private treatment record.  Thus, it is considered as if filed with the August 2010 claim pending at that time.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.156(b).\r\n\r\nFor clarity, and although the April 2012 rating decision reflects that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) adjudicated the issue of whether there was clear and unmistakable error in prior rating decisions denying service connection for PTSD and chronic anxiety state, the rating decision also addresses the merits of the claims of service connection for PTSD and chronic anxiety state.  The December 2012 statement of the case addresses service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD and anxiety state.  Thereafter the Veteran filed a substantive appeal (VA Form 9).  To the extent that statement of the case addresses clear and unmistakable error in the prior rating decisions, the Board finds the statement of the case to be inadequate in that respect, as detailed in the remand section.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran appeared at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in August 2013.\r\n\r\nThe electronic file shows that the Veteran perfected an appeal with respect to an initial rating in excess of 60 percent for coronary artery disease.  As such, the issue is reflected on the title page.  \r\n\r\nTestimony at the Board hearing raises the issue of whether there was CUE in a March 1993 rating decision that denied reopening the claim of service connection for chronic anxiety state (currently diagnosed as generalized anxiety disorder), and denied service connection for PTSD.  The AOJ has not adjudicated the issues and thus, the Board does not have jurisdiction over them.  As such, they are referred to the AOJ for appropriate action.  \r\n\r\nTo the extent the Veteran alleged CUE in the December 2011 rating decision.  This is not permissible as the decision was not final.  In fact, in the decision below, the Board is granting the benefit sought for a claim pending prior to that decision.\r\n\r\nThe issue of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 60 percent for coronary artery disease, along with the issues of where there was CUE in September 1971 and December 2011 rating decisions being remanded are addressed in the REMAND portion of the decision below and is REMANDED to the AOJ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nPTSD and generalized anxiety disorder are related to service.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1111, 5107(b), 5121A (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303, 3.304(f) (2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nI. Criteria\r\n\r\nService connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a pre-existing injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (2014).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d). \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nEffective July 13, 2010, VA amended the regulations for adjudicating disability compensation claims for PTSD in 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3) to liberalize the evidentiary standard for establishing the required in-service stressor in certain cases.  The current, liberalized version of � 3.304(f)(3) states that when the claimed in-service stressor is related to the veteran's \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity,\" the following shall be demonstrated to establish service connection for PTSD: 1) the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types and circumstances of the veteran's service; 2) a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or contract equivalent, confirms the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD; and 3) the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor. \r\n\r\nThis recent regulatory change has eliminated the requirement for submitting credible supporting evidence of the claimed in-service stressor if it is related to the veteran's \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.\"  For purposes of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3), \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness or horror.\r\n\r\nGenerally, veterans are presumed to have entered service in sound condition as to their health.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1111 (West 2014)  This presumption attaches only where there has been an induction examination in which the later complained-of disability was not detected.  See Bagby v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 225, 227 (1991).  The regulations provide expressly that the term \"noted\" denotes \"[o]nly such conditions as are recorded in examination reports,\" 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(b), and that \"[h]istory of preservice existence of conditions recorded at the time of examination does not constitute a notation of such conditions.\"  Id. at (b)(1).  \r\n\r\nThe application of the presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury not noted upon entry to service manifests in service, and a question arises as to whether it pre-existed service.  Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48 (2012).  Under such circumstances, VA is required to prove by clear and unmistakable evidence that a disease or injury manifesting in service both preexisted service and was not aggravated by service.  Id.  \r\n\r\nIn determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102 (2014); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). \r\n\r\nII. Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Veteran asserts entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder.  His symptoms have been variously diagnosed but primarily as PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder.  \r\n\r\nInitially, and to the extent that PTSD has noted to have preexisted service and/or attributed to childhood trauma, to include on VA examination in December 1992 and November 2010, the Board notes that a January 1964 Reserve examination report reflects psychiatric examination was normal.  His neuropsychiatric status was assigned a profile of \"1.\"  See Odiorne v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 456, 457 (1992) (observing that the 'PULHES' profile reflects the overall physical and psychiatric condition of the Veteran on a scale of 1 (high level of fitness) to 4 (a medical condition or physical defect which is below the level of medical fitness for retention in the military service)).  On the accompanying medical history, the Veteran denied having or having had frequent trouble sleeping, frequent or terrifying nightmares, depression or excessive worry, and nervous trouble of any sort.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the August 1964 ACDUTRA separation examination report shows psychiatric examination was normal.  His neuropsychiatric status was assigned a profile of \"1.\"  On the accompanying medical history he denied having or having had frequent trouble sleeping, frequent or terrifying nightmares, depression or excessive worry, and nervous trouble of any sort.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, and although a March 1971 VA treatment record notes inpatient treatment in 1967 with long standing anxiety symptoms diagnosed as chronic anxiety state, the May 1968 active duty service entrance examination report shows psychiatric examination.  In addition, and although psychiatric impairment was noted, the June 1969 separation examination report shows psychiatric evaluation was normal, and his neuropsychiatric status was assigned a profile of \"1.\"  In light of these contradictory findings, and having reviewed the record, the Board concludes that there is not clear and unmistakable evidence that a psychiatric disorder existed prior to service entrance.  Thus, the Veteran is presumed to have been in sound condition when entering service as to a psychiatric disorder.\r\nService records tend to show that at least psychiatric symptoms manifested during service.  Following his deployment to Vietnam in September 1968, he was accompanied by a recommendation for limited duty and deployment only to a location where psychiatric outpatient treatment was available.  In November 1968, he was noted to be more reclusive, more depressed, and getting worse.  \r\n\r\nAfter service, a December 1992 VA examination report reflecting a history of having come under small arms fire in a helicopter during service in Vietnam notes that the Veteran was transferred by helicopter on a weekly basis to psychiatric appointments.  Although the June 1969 separation examination report shows psychiatric evaluation was normal, on the accompanying medical history the Veteran indicated that he had depression or excessive worry, memory loss, and nervous trouble.\r\n\r\nWith respect to diagnosis, and although a November 2011 VA examination report reflects a diagnosis of somatoform disorder, a November 2010 VA examination report noting a history of the Veteran's camp having regularly come under mortar attack during service in Vietnam reflects the Veteran meets the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  \r\n\r\nConsistent with the November 2010 VA examiner's opinion is the opinion of the July 2011 private physician who determined that the Veteran meets the criteria for not only a diagnosis of PTSD but also generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).  Both the July 2011 private report and the December 1992 VA examination report conclude that the most traumatic circumstance of the Veteran's Vietnam service was related to the Veteran not being permitted to carry a gun due to his psychiatric disorder.  \r\n\r\nThe private report states that the Veteran felt terrified and feared for his life the entire time he was serving in Vietnam.  The physician noted that PTSD is most severe in individuals such as the Veteran who have an underlying psychiatric disorder such as GAD.  Based on this new July 2011 private treatment report, in conjunction with the other evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran has PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder related to service.\r\n\r\nResolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the evidence is in favor of the claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.  Consequently, service connection for PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder is warranted. \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder is granted.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nWith respect to CUE, an April 2012 rating decision addresses CUE in a September 1971 rating decision.  The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement with the rating decision.  Subsequently, a statement of the case (SOC) was issued in December 2012 and supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) was issued in May 2013.  The SOC and SSOC pertain to the claim decided above.  Although there is a passing reference to CUE in the SOC, a reasonable person would not understand this was a SOC for that issue as the issue was not listed on the SOC (or the SSOC) and there is little to no discussion of that potential issue or identification of any prior decision being challenged.  Thus, the Board finds that a SOC should be issued as to whether there was CUE in a September 1971 rating decision that denied the claim of service connection for chronic anxiety state.  See Manlincon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 238, 240-41 (1999).\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the Veteran seeks a higher initial rating for service-connected coronary artery disease.  He has not been afforded the Board hearing via videoconference requested in his substantive appeal.  As such, the matter is remanded to afford him a Board hearing.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, this issue is REMANDED for the following actions:\r\n\r\n1.  Issue a SOC whether there was CUE in a September 1971 rating decision that denied the claim of service connection for chronic anxiety state.  If, and only if, the Veteran files a timely substantive appeal should this issue be returned to the Board.\r\n\r\n2.  Also, Schedule the Veteran for a Board hearing via videoconference with respect to the issue of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 60 percent for coronary artery disease.  \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThese claims must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\nRYAN T.

Elias, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from September 1985 to February 1991.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2012 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Wichita, Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) in December 2013.  A transcript is of record.\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder was previously denied, however, at the time of the last decision on this claim, some of the Veteran's service records were not in the claims file.  They have since been obtained.  Under 38 C.F.R. � 3.156(c) (2014), if at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim.  Here, because relevant service treatment records have been received since the last decision on this claim, and because there is no indication that VA previously would have been unable to obtain them because they did not exist or because the Veteran failed to provide sufficient information, the claim must be reconsidered on the merits.  See id.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was incurred during his active military service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1154, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 4.125 (2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is based on his contention that his conditions are related to his military service.  For the following reasons, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder has been established.\r\n\r\nService connection means that a veteran has a current disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence shows that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).\r\n\r\nService connection is established when the following elements are satisfied: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or \"medical nexus\" between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  \r\n\r\nA veteran is considered to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1111.  A history of conditions existing prior to service recorded at the time of the entrance examination does not constitute a notation of such conditions for the purpose of establishing whether the Veteran was of sound condition at enlistment.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(b)(1).  However, the recording of such a history in the entrance examination will be considered together with all other material evidence in determinations as to inception of the disability at issue.  See id.  \r\n\r\nIn order to rebut the presumption of sound condition, VA must show by clear and unmistakable (obvious or manifest) evidence both (1) that the disease or injury existed prior to service and (2) that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service.  See � 3.304(b); Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); VAOPGCPREC 3-03 (July 16, 2003).  Thus, when the presumption of sound condition applies, the claimant is not required to establish aggravation by showing that the preexisting disease or injury increased in severity during service.  See VAOPGCPREC 3-03.  Rather, the burden remains with VA to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that the preexisting disease or injury was not aggravated by service.  See id.; Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096; see also Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 235 (2012) (observing that \"even when there is clear and unmistakable evidence of preexistence, the claimant need not produce any evidence of aggravation in order to prevail under the aggravation prong of the presumption of soundness\"). \r\n\r\nVA may find a lack of aggravation under 38 U.S.C. � 1111 if clear and unmistakable evidence shows that there was no increase in disability during service, or that any increase in disability was due to the natural progress of the preexisting condition.  Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096 (citing 38 U.S.C. � 1153 (West 2014) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.306 (2014)); but see Horn, 25 Vet. App. at 238 (emphasizing that \"neither the presumption of aggravation of section 1153 nor the regulation implementing that statutory provision, � 3.306, has any application to an analysis under the aggravation prong of the presumption of soundness in section 1111\").  If this burden is met, then the veteran is not entitled to service connection benefits.  Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the presumption of soundness applies and VA fails to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that the preexisting condition was not aggravated by active service, then the presumption has not been rebutted.  See id. at 1094 (holding that Congress intended to \"convert aggravation claims to ones for service connection when the government fails to overcome the presumption of soundness under section 1111\").  In that case, the claim will be considered as a normal claim for service connection and, if granted, no deduction for the degree of disability existing at the time of entrance will be made.  Id. at 1096 (citing 38 C.F.R. � 3.322).  In other words, the claim may not be denied, nor benefits deducted, on the basis of a finding that the disability in question preexisted active service, if VA does not also meet its evidentiary burden of showing that the disability was not aggravated during service.  Id. \r\n\r\nIf the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted, the disease or injury that manifested in service is deemed incurred in service, such that the second element of service connection is established.  See Gilbert, 26 Vet. App. at 53 (citing Horn, 25 Vet. App. at 236).  Nevertheless, the claimant must still establish a current disability related to the in-service injury or disease.  Id. (citing Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (\"The presumption of soundness . . . does not relieve the veteran of the obligation to show the presence of a current disability and to demonstrate a nexus between that disability and the in-service injury or disease or aggravation thereof.\")).\r\n\r\nThe clear-and-unmistakable-evidence standard is a much more formidable evidentiary burden to meet than the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.  See Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254, 258 (1999) (noting that the clear-and-unmistakable-evidence standard is more demanding than the clear-and-convincing-evidence standard, which in turn is higher than the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard).  It is an \"onerous\" and \"very demanding\" evidentiary standard, requiring that the evidence be \"undebatable.\"  Cotant v. West, 17 Vet. App. 116, 131 (2003) (citing Laposky v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 331, 334 (1993)).\r\n\r\nThe Board has reviewed all the evidence in the claims file and has an obligation to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases supporting its decision.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 7104(d)(1) (West 2014); Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence, accounting for evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant.  Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995).  A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107; 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.  When the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, the claimant prevails.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).  If the preponderance of the evidence weighs against the claim, it must be denied.  See id.; Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996).\r\n\r\nHere, the Veteran has been diagnosed with several acquired psychiatric disorders throughout his life, including major depressive disorder and PTSD.  Although there were no acquired psychiatric disorders noted at entry into service, the record shows, and the Veteran has testified that he had been diagnosed with acquired psychiatric disorders prior to his entry into service.  Thus, the Board must determine whether the presumption of soundness has been rebutted.  See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 55 (2012) (holding that the presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury manifests in service which was not noted on entry, and a question arises as to whether it preexisted service).  For the following reasons, the Board finds that the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's October 1984 entrance examination report does not note any psychiatric problems.  Therefore, the presumption of soundness attaches.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1111; 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(b)(1).   \r\n\r\nThere is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder preexisted service.  More specifically, an October 1984 consultation sheet states that the Veteran was referred by his school to a psychiatrist at age 16 and that he received treatment for two years.  In addition, a March 2006 letter from a community mental health clinic confirms that the Veteran participated in an intake assessment at the clinic in November 1979 and that his file was closed in January 1981.  Finally, the Veteran has repeatedly stated that he was treated for a psychiatric disorder prior to entering service.  Thus, there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran had an acquired psychiatric disorder prior to his active duty.\r\n\r\nHowever, the record does not contain clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was not aggravated by service.  In fact, the medical evidence in the record suggests the opposite.  For example, in the February 1998 VA examination report, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with major depression with psychotic features and stated that the Veteran described symptoms of major depression during service.  In addition, while describing the Veteran's diagnosis of major depression in a January 2002 letter, the Veteran's private physician discussed the Veteran's childhood trauma that was exacerbated by his military experience and led to a hospitalization for depression.  Finally, in a September 2004 letter, the Veteran's VA physician stated that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric conditions \"clearly intensified during his military experience.\"  Thus, VA has not met its burden to rebut the presumption of soundness, as the evidence is either favorable or in equipoise as to whether or not the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was aggravated by active service.  Therefore, the second element of service connection is established and benefits may not be deducted on the basis of evidence of pre-existence of an acquired psychiatric disorder.  See Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096.\r\n\r\nAs to the first and third elements of service connection, the Veteran has consistently been diagnosed with acquired psychiatric disorders since he was in service and throughout the pendency of this claim.  More specifically, the diagnoses of PTSD and/or depression are noted in service treatment records (when he was his spouse's dependent) dated September 1992 and October 1992; letters from private physicians dated  November 1993, January 1998, January 2002, and March 2002; and VA treatment records dated February 1998; March and August 2001; March, April, June, July, and December 2002; September and October 2003; February and September 2004; January, April, August, and October 2005; January, February, April, July, and November 2006; January, June, and September 2007; January and May 2008; April, May, July, September, and December 2010; January 2011; March, April, June, August, and October 2012; January, April, July, August, October, and November 2013; January, February, April, June, August, September, October, and December 2014; and January and March 2015, as well as many others.  Thus, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder and it has been continuously treated since his time in service.  A nexus between the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder and his period of active service is likewise established with the findings of aggravation reflected in the September 2004 letter from the Veteran's VA physician.  All of this evidence indicates that the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder is the result of or a continuation of the disorders he had in service.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the claim, service connection is warranted for the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nP. M.

The evidence does not demonstrate, clearly and unmistakably, that the Veteran's current back condition clearly and unmistakably pre-existed his military service. \r\n\r\n2. Resolving all benefit-of-the-doubt in favor of the Veteran, the evidence of record is at least in equipoise relating to the Veteran's back condition and his injury during his active military service. \r\n\r\n3. Resolving all benefit of the doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's acquired psychiatric conditions, to include PTSD and depression, are related to/aggravated by the Veteran's now service-connected back condition.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a back condition have been met. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1110, 1111, 1153, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304(b), 3.306, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310 (2015).\r\n\r\n2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include PTSD and depression, as secondary to a service-connected back condition, have been met. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1116, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.306, 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nService Connection - Back Condition \r\n\r\nThe Veteran asserts that his current diagnosed back condition is due to an injury he incurred while performing maneuvers during boot-camp during his military service. The Board finds that a review of the evidence of record, to include competent private and VA medical opinions, service treatment records (STRs), and lay statements, reveals that the Veteran's condition is etiologically related to the injury he sustained during service. As such, the Veteran's claim for service connection must be granted. \r\n\r\nGenerally, to prevail on a claim of service connection on the merits, there must be competent evidence of (1) current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence or other competent evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247 (1999); see also Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \r\n\r\nEvery veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment; or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service. 38 U.S.C.A. � 1111 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(b). Thus, there is a rebuttable presumption of soundness unless a condition is noted at entry. However, the presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury manifests in service which was not noted on entry, and a question arises as to whether it pre-existed service. Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 55 (2012). VA's General Counsel has held that to rebut the presumption of sound condition under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1111, VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence both that the disease or injury existed prior to service and that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service. VAOPGCPREC 3-2003 (July 16, 2003); see also Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\nThe Board notes that the Veteran has continuously contended that his current symptomatic back condition was related or aggravated by an incident during service where his squad was instructed to jump into foxholes during a training exercise and another solider, who jumped into the same foxhole, landed on his back. \r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, the Board finds that the evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran's back condition clearly and unmistakably pre-existed his period of active duty service, and that there is certainly no clear and unmistakable evidence that the any such condition was not aggravated during his service. Preliminarily, the Board notes that the Veteran enlisted in May 1972, entry examinations in his STRs noted no issues or pre-existing problems with his back upon entry. The report of medical history, completed by the Veteran himself also noted no issues with his back.\r\n\r\nIn June 1972, only a few weeks after entering service, the STRs reveal that the Veteran reported to sick-call with lower back pain (denoted as LBP). Further treatment records for that time period noted treatment and testing for his back injury he sustained during training. Later in June 1972, the Veteran's condition was evaluated by the Army Medical Board, where it was determined that the Veteran's back condition rendered him physically unfit for active service, and he was subsequently discharged from service. The Medical Board's decision also noted that the Veteran's condition was believed to have prevented him from physical civilian work prior to service. \r\n\r\nRelated to this claim, the VA afforded the Veteran with two VA Compensation and Pension (C&P) examinations in May 2009 and January 2015. Upon examination of the Veteran and his medical history, both VA examiners initially noted that the Veteran's back condition more likely than not pre-existed his service. However, the Board finds that neither examiner provided an adequate level of affirmation of the Veteran's pre-existing condition to rebut the Veteran's presumption of soundness. In other words, the level of standard to rebut the Veteran's presumption of soundness is clear and unmistakable, a far cry from as least likely as not. Short of that standard of proof and rationale offered by an examiner, such rebuttal under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1111, cannot succeed. \r\n\r\nTo this end, the Board notes that the Veteran has submitted several lay statements from his co-worker/classmates and his sports coach during high school, noting that they witnessed and knew of no evidence that the Veteran suffered from any type of back condition. While the Board understands that both such statements come from lay persons without the appropriate medical background and training to diagnose a back condition, the Board finds that such statements remain probative because of the circumstance of their, then, relationship. In other words, the Board finds that as the Veteran's football teammate during high school, and his coach for football and track and field, both lay persons have a unique perspective in evaluating any restrictions of the Veteran's physical abilities. In the same vein, the Board notes that the Veteran graduated from high school in 1971, only a year before enlisting. Such temporal proximity only increases the validity and weight of the probative value of such statements establishing a sound physical condition prior to entering his active service. \r\n\r\nFinally, the weight of the competent evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran's back condition was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated during service; or the second prong of rebutting the presumption of soundness. In fact, the January 2015 VA examiner has also opined, that the injury in service did in fact aggravate/exacerbated any back condition the Veteran may or may not have had. As such, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not rise to the level as to rebut the presumption of soundness and an evaluation of service connection, on a direct basis must be made. \r\n\r\nAs noted above, the threshold question for service connection must be the existence of a current disability. To this end, the Board finds that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a back condition, specifically spondylolisthesis of the L5-S1 with bilateral pars interarticularis defect. This diagnosis has been confirmed by VA examiners as well as the Veteran's treating physicians and medical professionals. Therefore, the first element of service connection has been satisfied. \r\nThe second prong of an in-service injury or incurrence is also well documented in the Veteran's STRs. Specifically, notes in the Veteran's STRs indicated the Veteran injured his back and suffered from low back pain during service. The Veteran has also consistently reported that his back was injured when a fellow solider jumped into the same foxhole he was in and landed on his back. Such evidence is ample to satisfy the in-service element for service connection. \r\n\r\nFinally, the third prong to establish service connection, also known as the nexus element, has also been established by the evidence of record. Here, there are both positive and negative medical opinions, regarding the Veteran's current back condition. \r\n\r\nRegarding a nexus, the Board notes that the Veteran has submitted a private medical opinion from his treating medical professional, who attests to the fact that the Veteran's current back condition was aggravated/exacerbated, or otherwise caused, by his injury to his back during service. Specifically, the Veteran's long time chiropractor, F. A., found that the Veteran's current symptomatic condition was caused by a trauma, such as that described during his military service, and that such force exacerbated/caused his current back condition. See Medical Opinion from F. A., D. C., dated July 22, 2008. \r\n\r\nConversely, the VA has also obtained two medical opinions that are seemingly against the above private opinion regarding nexus. The Veteran was afforded two VA C&P examination for this condition in May 2009 and January 2015. In both examination reports, the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's current condition was simply a continuation of his back condition that pre-existed his active military service. In both instances, the VA examiners specifically cited the Army Medical Board findings of June 1972 that the Veteran was never actually physically fit for active service. Therefore, both VA examiners opined that such back condition could not be solely caused by the Veteran's injury during service. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded the first of these examinations in May 2009, the examiner, after reviewing the claims file and examining the Veteran's back, concluded that the Veteran's condition pre-existed his military service. However, the Board finds that this examiner's opinion to be inadequate. The VA examiner failed to provide any rationale regarding his conclusion that the Veteran's back condition pre-existed his military service, as he based his nexus conclusion solely on the Army Medical Boards evaluation. That examiner also failed to provide any opinion regarding any aggravating/exacerbating effects the Veteran's in-service injury may have had on his current condition. As such, this opinion is inadequate and carries little probative weight. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's second VA C&P examination, in January 2015, provides a confusing and nearly contradictory conclusion and rationale. Specifically, the examiner concluded that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's condition was incurred or caused by the claimed in-service injury, explaining that such condition was not caused by an acute injury. However, later in the report, the examiner also noted in another worksheet that the condition was not proximately due to any service-connected disability, and explicitly opined that the Veteran's present back condition \"appears to be due to his back injury of June 1972,\" during his active duty service, as well as post-service back injuries. The Board finds that two opinions to be at best inadequate and nearly contradictory, offering almost a positive nexus opinion in the latter opinion. As such, the Board finds that this opinion, like the VA examination preceding it, to be inadequate and offers little probative value. \r\n \r\nConsequently, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise regarding a nexus between the Veteran's current condition and his injury during his military service. Therefore, in affording the Veteran the benefit-of-the-doubt, the Veteran's claim of service connection for a back condition must be granted. \r\n\r\nService Connection - Acquired Psychiatric Condition, PTSD \r\n\t\r\nThe Veteran claims, essentially, that his PTSD, or any acquired psychiatric condition, to include major depressive disorder, is due to his back condition, which has been service connected herein. The Board has construed the claim in accordance with Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (observing that when determining the scope of a claim, the Board must consider the claimant's description of the claim; the symptoms the claimant describes; and the information the claimant submits or that the Secretary obtains in support of that claim). The Board notes that competent medical evidence of record, which includes a positive nexus opinion from a private psychiatrist, reveals that the Veteran's psychiatric conditions are in fact proximately caused/aggravated by the Veteran's, now, service-connected back condition. Therefore, the Veteran's claim for service connection must be granted. \r\n\r\nA claim for secondary service connection requires medical evidence that connects the asserted secondary disability to the service-connected disability. See Velez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 148, 158 (1998). In order to establish entitlement to service connection on this secondary basis, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) medical evidence establishing a link between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).\r\n\r\nA disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury shall be service connected. When service connection is thus established for a secondary condition, the secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition. 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a). Secondary service connection may also be established for a nonservice-connected disability which is aggravated by a service connected disability. In such an instance, the Veteran may be compensated for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation. 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(b); see Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).\r\n\r\nHere, the Veteran has provided a February 2013 private psychiatric evaluation from a board certified psychologist, Dr. J. C. After conducting a thorough interview of the Veteran, as well as reviewing his claims file, and medical history, the examiner noted an Axis I diagnosis of PTSD, as well as an Axis II diagnosis of major depressive disorder, with history of traumatic brain trauma. While the examiner noted that the Veteran suffered psychologically traumatic events when he was a child, and was abused, the examiner, significantly, concluded that the Veteran's depression was aggravated by his back condition, which is now service connected.  To this end, the examiner explicitly noted that the Veteran, essentially, shuts down when his back starts hurting and just does not want to leave his bed. The examiner concludes that this not only affects his motivation, but also would prevent him from doing any work. Therefore, he concludes that his service-connected back condition does in fact aggravate his depression. \r\n\r\nThe Board finds this medical examination to be highly probative and dispositive of the inquiry at hand. The conclusion is accurately provided, along with a rationale and full review and analysis of the medical and psychiatric history of the Veteran. Indeed, the examination report is even completed on a VA psychiatric evaluation form, VA Form 21-0960P-2; and it is the only medical opinion of record.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, secondary service connection can also be established if the claimed condition was aggravated by a service-connected condition. Here, the only medical evidence of record shows that the Veteran's depression, and other undistinguishable psychiatric conditions, to include PTSD, was/has been aggravated by his, now, service-connect back condition. Therefore, the Board finds that service connection for his psychiatric conditions is warranted, and the claim must be granted.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for a back condition is granted. \r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include PTSD and major depressive disorder, as secondary to service-connected back condition is granted. \r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that additional evidentiary development is necessary before the Board can adjudicate the Veteran's claim for a TDIU. Although the Board sincerely regrets the additional delay, it is necessary to ensure that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claims so that he is afforded every possible consideration.\r\n\r\nAs the level of rating for the granted claims of service connection decided herein, is relevant to the Veteran's TDIU request, as they are the only service-connected disabilities awarded to the Veteran, this issue must be considered inextricably intertwined. Therefore, the Veteran's request for a TDIU must be remanded as they are intertwined with the determinations of ratings for his now service-connected conditions. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (noting that when a determination on one issue could have a significant impact on the outcome of another issue, such issues are considered inextricably intertwined and VA is required to decide those issues together).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. When disability ratings and effective dates have been determined for all service-connected disabilities, to include those granted herein, and all development that the RO deems necessary is undertaken, the Veteran's request for a TDIU should be readjudicated. If any benefit sought on appeal remains denied, the Veteran and his representative should be provided with a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) that contains notice of all relevant actions taken, including a summary of the evidence and applicable law and regulations considered pertinent to the issues. An appropriate period of time should be allowed for response by the Veteran and his representative. Thereafter, the case should be returned to the Board for further appellate consideration, if in order.\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\nBRADLEY W.

Thomas, Associate Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on active duty from June 1998 to April 1999.\r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2009 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Houston, Texas.  Jurisdiction has since been transferred to the VA RO in Denver, Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran initially requested a Travel Board hearing.  However, he withdrew this request in a May 2016 statement.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the contentions and evidence of record, the Board finds that the issues on appeal are more accurately stated as listed on the title page of this decision.  In Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disorder that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and other information of record.  In consideration of Clemons and the other diagnoses of record, the Board has re-characterized the claims as reflected on the title page.\r\n\r\nIn November 2016, during the pendency of this appeal, the Veteran revoked his Power of Attorney, which had appointed J. Michael Woods, Esquire, as his representative.  The Board finds that the Veteran properly revoked this attorney's representation.  See 38 C.F.R. � 14.631(f)(1).  At the same time, the Veteran appointed Disabled American Veterans as his new representative.\r\n\r\nThe issue of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral knee condition is addressed in the REMAND portion of the decision below and is REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDING OF FACT\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, is caused by his service-connected disabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nThe criteria for service connection an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, have been met. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, (2015).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nDuties to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations imposes obligations on VA to provide claimants with notice and assistance.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.326(a).  Given the favorable outcome of this decision, no prejudice to the Veteran could result from this decision.  See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 (1993).\r\n\r\nService Connection - Laws and Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).\r\n\r\nService connection is also warranted for disability proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a).  Such secondary service connection is warranted for any increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progress of the nonservice-connected disease.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(b).  \r\n\r\nIn rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material favorable to the claimant.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).  Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). \r\n\r\nWhen considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  A veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to her through her senses.  See Layno, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469.  Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  Lay evidence may establish a diagnosis of a simple medical condition, a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or symptoms that later support a diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377. \r\n\r\nIn the case of conflicting medical opinions, the Board must weigh the credibility and probative value of the medical opinions, and in so doing, the Board may favor one medical opinion over the other.  See Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 (1998) (citing Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995)); see also Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2001) (it is not error for the Board to favor the opinion of one competent medical expert over that of another when the Board gives an adequate statement of reasons and bases for doing so).  The probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion the physician reaches.  Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470 (1993).  Other factors affecting the probative value of a medical opinion include thoroughness and degree of detail, and a well-reasoned rationale.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-49 (2000); see also Bloom v.West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999).  The credibility and weight to be attached to these opinions is within the province of the Board.  Id.\r\n\r\nWhen all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.\r\n\r\nService Connection for an Acquired Psychiatric Condition - Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that his current acquired psychiatric conditions are related to or caused by his service-connected disabilities.  His medical treatment records list current diagnoses of depressive disorder NOS, generalized anxiety disorder, mood disorder NOS, bipolar disorder, personality disorder and alcohol dependence.\r\n\r\nAn October 2002 VA treatment record indicates that the Veteran had been diagnosed with depression.\r\n\r\nA March 2007 VA treatment record indicates that the Veteran had been diagnosed with anxiety disorder NOS.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in August 2009.  The VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with depression NOS.  The VA examiner stated that the question of whether this diagnosis is related to or caused by the service-connected Hodgkin's disease could not be resolved without resort to mere speculation, noting that the Hodgkin's disease had been in remission for 10 years.\r\n\r\nA September 2009 VA treatment record indicates that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a mood disorder NOS and alcohol dependence.\r\n\r\nIn a February 2010 VA treatment record, the Veteran reported that he began to experience depression and an increase in anxiety and anger after he was diagnosed and treated for Hodgkin's Lymphoma while on active duty.  He was diagnosed with cyclothymic disorder.\r\n\r\nAn October 2011 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's Hodgkin's disease caused him to have ongoing problems with intermittent fatigue, mood swings impacting his work ability, and interpersonal relationships.\r\n\r\nA February 2012 VA treatment record indicates that the Veteran reported having felt depressed for 14 years.  He was diagnosed with depression.\r\n\r\nA March 2012 VA treatment record indicates that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a bipolar spectrum disorder.\r\n\r\nIn November 2012, the Veteran reported that he had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and non-combat PTSD starting in March 2007, related to his service-connected Hodgkin's disease.  He stated that he began dealing with his depression by drinking while he was in service.  He also reported being diagnosed with alcohol dependence, which he described as beginning during service as a way to cope with his mental health issues related to his Hodgkin's disease.  \r\n\r\nIn December 2013, a private psychologist diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and depressive disorder NOS.  He stated that the Veteran's PTSD was caused by his loss of his career as a police officer and loss of his health when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease.  He noted that the Veteran was let go from his job as a police officer due to his service-connected right arm disability.  The psychologist also stated that the Veteran lived in constant threat of his Hodgkin's disease recurring and passing this disease on to his children.  This opinion is probative as it was offered in connection with the psychologist's treatment of the Veteran, indicating a strong familiarity with the Veteran's condition, and provides an adequate rationale for the conclusions. \r\n\r\nIn October 2014, a private psychologist evaluated the Veteran and opined that the service-connected right arm brachial plexus nerve injury (right arm disability) and scars caused his current mood disorder.  She also opined that the Veteran's service-connected right arm disability, associated with Hodgkin's disease; scar, right and left anterior chest; and scar, right lateral chest, are more likely than not aggravating his mood disorder.  The private psychologist gave a detailed description of the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms, service-connected disabilities, and psychiatric and medical treatment history.  In support of her opinion, she cited medical literature supporting a causal relationship between medical and psychiatric difficulty.  The Board finds this medical opinion to be highly probative. This opinion included a detailed and accurate description of the Veteran's medical and psychiatric treatment history, citations to medical literature support the relationship between the service-connected disabilities and current acquired psychiatric disability, and an adequate rationale for the conclusion.\r\n\r\nAfter a review of all of the evidence of record, both lay and medical, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is in favor of a finding that the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder and  generalized anxiety disorder, is related to or caused by his service-connected disabilities.  The December 2013 and October 2014 private opinions are the only adequate medical opinions of record, and both conclude that the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disability is related to his service-connected disabilities.  For these reasons, and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, claimed as secondary to the service-connected disabilities, have been met.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107; 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nOnce VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a service-connection claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide an adequate one. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2009.  He reported speculation by his physicians that his knee pain was a side effect of chemotherapy treatment for Hodgkin's disease during service.  He reported that the knee pain began six or seven years earlier.  The Veteran contended that his left knee pain was secondary to a right knee condition.  X-rays revealed a \"posterior horn, lateral meniscus possible tear\" of the right knee.  X-rays did not reveal any left knee abnormalities.  The VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with a degenerative lateral meniscus of the right knee.  He explicitly stated that degenerative joint disease was not found in the Veteran's bilateral knees.  No nexus opinion was given for the Veteran's lateral meniscus condition.  \r\n\r\nIn December 2009, the Veteran had surgery to repair a lateral meniscal tear and to replace his right knee ACL.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2011.  He reported having surgery for an ACL replacement of the right knee in December 2009.  He also had a debridement arthroscopy of the right knee in August 2010.  The Veteran reported having osteoarthritis of both knees with an onset date of 2000.  He did not report any injury.\r\n\r\nIn December 2016, the Veteran's representative contended that his knees were injured during in-service basic training involving jumping with back packs and crawling on his knees.\r\n\r\nOnce VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a service-connection claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide an adequate one. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).  As the July 2009 VA examination did not address the etiology of the Veteran's lateral meniscus tear or his ACL condition, a new examination is necessary.\r\n\r\nEvery Veteran is presumed to have been in sound condition at entry into service except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of such entry, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before entry and was not aggravated by such service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1111.  The term \"noted,\" in 38 U.S.C.A. � 1111, refers to \"[o]nly such conditions as are recorded in examination reports.\"  38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (b).  As there were no defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entry into service, the Veteran's right knee is presumed to have been in sound condition at this time.  However, this presumption can be rebutted by clear and unmistakable (obvious or manifest) evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior to service and was not aggravated by such service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(b).  \r\n\r\nIn August 2007, a VA psychology treatment note indicated that the Veteran reported injuring his right knee at age 14 while wrestling.  He stated that he had a tear in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).  The Board finds these statements to be both competent and credible.  Therefore, a new examination to determine whether the Veteran's current bilateral knee conditions are related to service, whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the right knee conditions preexisted service, and whether any preexisting right knee disability was aggravated by service. See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 52 (2012) (\"before the presumption of soundness is for application, there must be evidence that a disease or injury that was not noted upon entry to service manifested or was incurred in service\").\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n1. Obtain the Veteran's updated VA and private treatment records related to his bilateral knee conditions.\r\n\r\n2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his bilateral knee conditions.  The claims file, including a copy of this Remand, must be made available to, and be reviewed by, the VA examiner.  \r\n\r\nThe VA examiner should provide the following opinions:\r\n\r\n(a)  Whether any right or left knee condition is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or greater) related to or caused by his service, to include the effect of in-service basic training involving jumping with back packs and crawling on his knees.\r\n\r\n(b) Whether any right or left knee condition is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or greater) related to or caused by any treatment for his service-connected Hodgkin's disease.\r\n\r\n(c) Whether (i) a right knee disability clearly and unmistakably preexisted service and, if so, (ii) whether such preexisting disorder clearly and unmistakably was not aggravated by service.\r\n\r\nThe term \"at least as likely as not\" does not mean within the realm of possibility, but rather that the evidence both for and against a conclusion is so evenly divided that it is as sound to find in favor of a certain conclusion as it is to find against it.\r\n\r\nThe VA examiner must provide a detailed rationale for all opinions rendered. If the examiner cannot provide the requested information without resort to speculation, it must be so stated with reasons why, and if an additional clinical evaluation is necessary to render the requested information, then that opportunity should be made available.\r\n\r\n3. After completion of the above and compliance with the requested actions has been ensured, readjudicate the issue on appeal on the basis of the additional evidence of record.  If the determinations remain adverse to the Veteran, he and his representative should be furnished with a Supplemental Statement of the Case.  An appropriate period of time should then be allowed for a response before the record is returned to the Board for further review.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5109B, 7112 (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\nK.

psychiatric disorder.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nVeteran represented by:\tVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nM. Taylor, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1970 to August 1974.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2011 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).\r\n\r\nIn October 2014, the Board remanded the case for further development.  \r\n\r\nPer the authority granted in 38 U.S.C.A. � 7109 and 38 C.F.R. � 20.901, the Board requested that a medical expert from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) render an opinion regarding the potential relationship between a psychiatric disorder and service.  The VHA opinion and associated addendum were obtained in October 2016 and February 2017, respectively.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran does meet the criteria for a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  \r\n\r\n2.  The Veteran's chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features is related to service.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  The criteria for service connection for PTSD are not met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2016).\r\n\r\n2.  The criteria for service connection for chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2016).  \r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThe Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).\r\n\r\nI.  Laws and Regulations\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  \"To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: \"(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service\"-the so-called \"nexus\" requirement.\"  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). \r\n\r\nEstablishment of service connection for PTSD in particular requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nA diagnosis of PTSD must be in conformance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria.  Effective March 19, 2015, VA replaced outdated references with references to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5).  \r\n\r\nII.  Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for a psychiatric disorder.  He maintains that his variously diagnosed psychiatric disorder stems from the trauma of potentially being deployed to a combat zone in Vietnam while stationed in Japan during service in 1974.  \r\n\r\nInitially, the Board notes that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  The Veteran specifically identified PTSD as the claimed disability in his December 2010 claim.  However, as noted in the Board's October 2014 remand, other potential psychiatric disorders reflected in the record result in a claim with a broader scope than solely PTSD.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran's DD FORM 214 reflects his military occupational specialty (MOS) is listed as \"DSTE\" (Digital Subscriber Terminal Equipment) maintenance repairman.  Although there is no indicia of service in Vietnam, five months and 19 days of foreign service is noted, and service treatment records document service in Japan.  \r\n\r\nFurther, the June 1970 service entrance examination report shows that psychiatric evaluation was normal, and on the accompanying medical history, he denied having or having had depression or excessive worry and nervous trouble of any sort.  A January 1973 service treatment records reflects a diagnosis of chest wall syndrome secondary to anxiety.  In addition, the August 1974 separation examination report, which was accomplished at Yokota Air Base in Japan, reflects two episodes of chest pain diagnosed as chest wall syndrome secondary to anxiety, one of which was noted to have occurred in 1974.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, and although a December 2010 VA treatment record reflects an impression of PTSD based on the Veteran's detailed, self-report of numerous traumas experienced during alleged service in Vietnam, the July 2012 VA examiner clarified that the Veteran did not serve in Vietnam, noting the Veteran's admission that he never had orders to rebuild a damaged communication center in Vietnam.  \"Instead, he states that his memories and nightmares are of the time he was stationed in Japan 'just sitting and waiting and anticipating you might get orders.'  It was noted that the Veteran recalled that he was fearful that he might be sent to Vietnam.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, both the July 2012 and February 2011 VA examiners specifically determined that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD based upon clinical testing.  Although the Veteran's VA psychiatrist noted in April 2016 that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were related to his fear of deployment to high threat zones during service, with a corresponding daily fear of death, culminating in his current symptoms, which were noted to be very similar to those experienced in individuals with PTSD, the diagnosis entered was chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features, not PTSD.  \r\n\r\nThe Board notes that although the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms, medical expertise is necessary to provide a diagnosis of any certain psychiatric disorder.  See, e.g., Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (\"PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence . . . is competent and sufficient to identify.\").  Here, the probative evidence establishes that the Veteran neither served in Vietnam nor met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD at any time during the appeal period.  Thus, the Board finds that service connection for PTSD is not warranted.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to diagnoses other than PTSD, and although a December 2011 letter from the Veteran's VA psychiatrist notes depressive disorder, not otherwise specified (NOS), the July 2012 VA examiner determined that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder.  In addition, the February 2015 VA examination report reflecting a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder notes that the conflict in the evidence made it difficult to determine whether the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were related to service.  The examiner added that although the Veteran may believe that his symptoms are due to his experiences during service in Japan, he likely engages in significant misattribution.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in addition to chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features diagnosed by the Veteran's VA psychiatrist in April 2016 and noted to be related to service, the February 2017 VHA addendum opinion states that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's recurrent manifestations of anxiety have been exacerbated by service, at least in part.  To the extent that the February 2017 VHA addendum opinion raises the possibility of a psychiatric disability existing prior to service entrance, in the absence of clear and unmistakable evidence showing that a psychiatric disorder existed prior to service entrance and was not aggravated by such service, the presumption of soundness at service entrance is not rebutted.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1111; 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(b); see also Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48 (2012).  \r\n\r\nThe evidence is in at least equipoise with respect to service connection for chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features and, when resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran has chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features related to service.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.

Olson, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active duty for training from October 1975 to March 1976 active duty in the Marine Corps from June 1977 to September 1989.\r\n\r\nThe issues come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions of the Appeals Management Center in Washington, DC, and by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Waco, Texas.  The Waco RO otherwise has jurisdiction of the claims folder.\r\n\r\nIn February 2017, the Veteran testified at a videoconference hearing.  A transcript of that hearing is of record.\r\n\r\nThe claims file is now entirely in VA's secure electronic processing systems, Virtual VA and Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).\r\n\r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2016).  38 U.S.C.A. � 7107(a)(2) (West 2014).\r\n\r\nThe issues of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD, a lumbar spine disability, brain aneurysm and stroke, left eye impaired vision, a bilateral hip disability, bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus; entitlement to initial higher ratings for right and left knee degenerative joint disease; entitlement to a TDIU, and entitlement to SMC based on A&A or HB status are addressed in the REMAND portion of the decision below and are REMANDED to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, his claimed stressor event is not related to hostile or terrorist activity and is not verified, and he does not currently have a diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with DSM-IV that is related to a verified stressor event.\r\n\r\n2.  The Veteran evidenced pes planus prior to active duty for training and it was not made worse by active duty training or service.  There was some treatment of foot complaints in service that appear to have resolved.  Later examinations revealed normal feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran does not have PTSD that was incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.304 (2016).\r\n\r\n2.  The Veteran does not have pes planus was not incurred in or aggravated by active duty service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 1153, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.306 (2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nPreliminary Matter\r\n\r\nAs provided for by the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a duty to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2015).  \r\n\r\nThe requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5103 and 5103A have been met as to the issues decided herein.  There is no issue as to providing an appropriate application form or completeness of the application.  VA notified the Veteran in May 2008 and November 2013 of the information and evidence needed to substantiate and complete a claim, to include notice of what part of that evidence is to be provided by the claimant, what part VA will attempt to obtain, and how disability ratings and effective dates are determined.  VA fulfilled its duty to assist the Veteran in obtaining identified and available evidence needed to substantiate a claim.  There is no evidence that additional records have yet to be requested.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran was not provided with a VA examination and opinion to assess the current nature and etiology of his claimed PTSD and pes planus; however, VA need not conduct an examination with respect to these claims as information and evidence of record contains sufficient competent medical evidence to decide the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (c)(4).  Under McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), in disability compensation (service connection) claims, VA must provide a medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the VA to make a decision on the claim.  In this case, the standards of McLendon are not met in this case as there is no current diagnosis of either PTSD or pes planus.  As such, remand for a VA examination is not necessary.\r\n\r\nService Connection\r\n\r\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for PTSD and pes planus.  \r\n\r\nService connection means that the facts establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated during service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  Generally, to prevail on the issue of service connection there must be evidence of a current disability, in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  \r\n\r\nPTSD\r\n\r\nThe service treatment records are absent complaints, findings, or diagnoses of any psychiatric condition during service.  On Reports of Medical History completed by the Veteran in June 1984, August 1985, and June 1989 he denied ever having depression, excessive worry, and nervous trouble of any sort.  In August 1986, the Veteran indicated that he did not know if he had depression or excessive worry and initially began to place an \"x\" in the box associated with not knowing if he had nervous trouble of any sort, but he scratched it out.  On clinical examinations in June 1984, August 1985, and June 1989, the Veteran's psychiatric health was evaluated as normal.  Thus, there is no medical evidence that shows that the Veteran suffered from any psychiatric disorders during service. \r\n\r\nTo establish entitlement to service connection for there must be medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms of PTSD and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f).  A diagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), which simply mandates that, for VA purposes, all mental disorder diagnoses must conform to the criteria of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth edition, (DSM-V).  See 79 Fed. Reg. 45099 (August 4, 2014). \r\n\r\nInitially, the Board notes that the Veteran does not contend, and the evidence does not demonstrate, that his PTSD stressors are related to combat or to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  Thus the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154 (b) (2014) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.304 (f)(2), (3) (2016) do not apply.  Instead, in December 2013, the Veteran reported on his Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for PTSD that while he was stationed at Camp Foster in Okinawa, Japan, an individual became really upset when the Veteran became eligible for a promotion to sergeant.  At a bar, the individual and two of his friends hit the Veteran in the head and face over and over again.  The Veteran stated that the commanding officer gave NJP (nonjudicial punishment).  At his February 2017 hearing, the Veteran testified that he was in Okinawa downtown and that when he got back to base, some guys jumped him and beat him up.  He also testified that he saw some guy get shot by the Filipino marines.      \r\n\r\nIn this case, the Board finds that there is no credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressors occurred.  The Veteran has not submitted any information or evidence to corroborate his contentions that either event occurred in service; nor has he provided sufficient detail to allow for proper research or verification.  No pertinent medical treatment is shown to be provided during service.\r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the RO made reasonable efforts to obtain information to enable it to verify the claimed stressor events.  The RO obtained service personnel records and provided a VA Form 21-0781, Statement in Support of Claim for PTSD, and VA Form 21-0781a, Statement in Support of Claim for PTSD Secondary to Personal Assault.  The Veteran was advised that VA needed specific details. The Veteran provided information concerning the stressor event in which he was assaulted while stationed at Camp Foster in Okinawa, Japan, by three individuals at a bar; and that the commanding officer gave NJP.  The Veteran indicated that the incident happened in 1985 but noted that he had an aneurysm and lost his memory.  In this case, however, the contemporary evidence of record is inconsistent with the Veteran's statement of a head injury during his active duty service.  On Reports of Medical History completed by the Veteran in June 1984, August 1985, August 1986 and June 1989, he denied ever having a head injury.  \r\n\r\nIn short, the Veteran's claimed stressor of being attacked and hit in the head over and over is not credible.  Far from being verified, this stressor has, in fact, been contradicted by the objective evidence of record.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, there is no current diagnosis of PTSD of record.  In September 2006, May 2009, July 2011, screens for PTSD were negative; screen for PTSD in June 2013 was positive.  In addition, two PTSD screens administered on the same day in May 2009, resulted in one administered by a psychiatrist being negative and one administered by a nurse being positive.  A September 2009, Axis I diagnosis included \"r/o PTSD.\"  \r\n\r\nAlthough some treatment records reference a diagnosis of PTSD, none of the PTSD diagnoses are made in conformance with the DSM-IV or V criteria, and as noted above, the single Axis I diagnosis including PTSD is recorded as \"r[ule] o[ut] PTSD.\"  Subsequent Axis I diagnoses included mood disorder due to medical condition and major depressive disorder in addition to alcohol abuse, cannabis abuse, and tobacco use disorder.  Thus, the Board finds that the reference to \"r/o PTSD\" and the noted \"cva with PTSD\" in the VA treatment records cannot be interpreted as a finding that PTSD is a current disability, or that it has been present at any specific time pertinent to the appeal.    \r\n\r\nIn summary, the Board finds that the most competent, credible, and probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran currently or at any point during the appeal period has received a valid diagnosis of PTSD.  The Board further finds that the Veteran's claimed stressor of being hit in the head over and over is not credible and neither stressor has been verified. \r\n\r\nThe weight of the competent evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD, and there is no independent evidence corroborating the Veteran's statement as to the occurrence of his claimed stressors.  As such, the evidence of record does not establish a DSM-V diagnosis of PTSD based upon a verified stressor event.  \r\n\r\nThus, for the foregoing reasons, the claim for service connection for PTSD must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable.\r\n\r\nPes Planus\r\n\r\nOn his Report of Medical Examination in September 1975 for the purpose of enlistment, the Veteran's feet were noted to be abnormal and he was diagnosed as having \"pes planus 2�, asymptomatic.\"  On the Report of Medical History completed by the Veteran in conjunction with his entrance physical, he denied ever having foot trouble.  \r\n\r\nEvery veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1111 (West 2014).  The Board notes that the presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury not noted upon entry to service manifests in service, and a question arises as to whether it preexisted service.  Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 55 (2012).  In this case, as pes planus was noted on his entrance examination, the presumption of soundness does not apply.   \r\n\r\nAs the pes planus was noted upon entry into duty, and hence active service, the question becomes whether the disability was aggravated beyond natural progression during service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1153.  Where a preexisting disease or injury is noted on the entrance examination, 38 U.S.C.A. � 1153 provides that \"[a] preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active military, naval, or air service, where there is an increase in disability during such service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease.\"  38 U.S.C.A. � 1153; 38 C.F.R. � 3.306(a).  For veterans who served during a period of war or after December 31, 1946, clear and unmistakable evidence is required to rebut the presumption of aggravation where the pre-service disability underwent an increase in severity during service.  Clear and unmistakable evidence includes medical facts and principles which may be considered to determine whether the increase is due to the natural progress of the disability at issue.  38 C.F.R. � 3.306 (b).  Temporary or intermittent flare-ups of symptoms of a preexisting condition, alone, do not constitute sufficient evidence for a noncombat veteran to show increased disability for the purposes of determinations of service connection based on aggravation under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1153 unless the underlying condition worsened.  Aggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during, and subsequent to service.  38 C.F.R. � 3.306 (b).\r\n\r\nIn January 1978, the Veteran presented with complaint of pain in bottom of feet to both calves for three days and bottom of feet for one week.  He denied any trauma, and the provider noted that he had been in repeatedly for the same problem.  Assessment was muscle strains.  In March 1978, the Veteran presented with complaint of painful feet with edema and cramping for approximately 1 1/2 years.  The Veteran stated that the symptoms were severe enough to interfere with his performance of military duty and that past treatment with over-the-counter arches gave no relief.  Examination revealed grade II pes planus with adequate but painful subtalar joint  and midtarsal joint range of motion.  The Veteran also noted pain with palpation of plantar aponeurosis, and mild triceps equinous.  Diagnosis was pes planus syndrome.  He was placed on light duty and issued arch supports.  The provider noted, \"if no results, possible Med[ical] Board.\"  In July 1980, the Veteran presented with complaint of pain right side of foot with pain radiating to arch.  The Veteran was provided exercises to increase strength in arch area.  An undated treatment record, barely legible, indicates assessment of mild inflammation of Achilles tendon.  \r\n\r\nOn Report of Medical History completed by the Veteran in June 1984, he noted foot trouble; in response, the examiner noted soft tissue strain both knees and ankles after joining Marine Corps during boot camp which resolved after boot camp.  On Reports of Medical History completed by the Veteran in August 1985, August 1986, and June 1989, he denied ever having foot trouble.  On clinical examinations in June 1984, August 1985, August 1986, and June 1989, the Veteran's feet were evaluated as normal.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that the record lacks competent evidence that demonstrates that the Veteran's bilateral pes planus underwent a permanent worsening during his active duty service.      \r\n\r\nIn addition, there is no current diagnosis of pes planus of record.  Private treatment records and VA treatment records indicate that the Veteran was seen numerous times for diabetic foot care.  At no time during any of these appointments was the Veteran diagnosed as having pes planus.  \r\n\r\nThe weight of the competent evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of pes planus.  Thus, for the foregoing reasons, the claim for service connection for pes planus must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus is denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAND\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the issues of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD, a lumbar spine disability, brain aneurysm and stroke, left eye impaired vision, a bilateral hip disability, bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus; entitlement to initial higher ratings for right and left knee degenerative joint disease; entitlement to a TDIU; and entitlement to SMC based on A&A or HB status are being remanded to the AOJ.\r\n\r\nThe Veteran testified in February 2017 that his service-connected knees caused his legs to give way and he fell and hit his head on cement which caused the aneurysm and the stroke which also resulted in left eye visual impairment.  The Veteran's spouse testified, \"at the moment that he fell, his both hips were broken.\"  \r\n\r\nThe record includes medical records from Sierra Medical Center from July 5, 2003; however, the information from the hospital reveals that the Veteran was seen initially at the Sierra Medical Center emergency department for chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and headache and later diagnosed with closed head injury and later with subarachnoid hemorrhage on the left due to an aneurysm, status post craniotomy and clipping of the aneurysm on July 18, 2003.      \r\n\r\nIt is clear from the record that on July 5, 2003, the Veteran hit his head, was brought to the emergency room, was found to have subarachnoid hemorrhage, and  underwent craniotomy.  There is a question of whether the aneurysm ruptured before the Veteran fell or whether the fall caused the ruptured aneurysm.  \r\n\r\nThe emergency department records do not appear to be in the file; as such, an attempt to obtain them should be made.      \r\n\r\nThe Veteran has also identified outstanding medical records for the issues on appeal.  He testified in February 2017 that he was currently being treated by a private physician, Dr. Jackson, for his knees and hips.  The Veteran also testified that the prior year, Dr. Viesca had injected him 30 times in his back.  The Veteran further testified that eight months prior to the hearing, he saw a private physician for his hearing and for his eyes.\r\n\r\nAs such, prior to adjudication, an attempt to obtain all outstanding medical evidence should be made.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the record indicates that the Veteran has left upper lid ptosis due to CVA as well as depression and anxiety due to stroke.  As such these issues are inextricably intertwined with the issue of entitlement to service connection for brain aneurysm/stroke.  Further, entitlement to a TDIU and SMC are inextricably intertwined with the claims being remanded, as the outcome may impact the TDIU and SMC claims.  See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183   (1991) (issues are \"inextricably intertwined\" when a decision on one issue would have a \"significant impact\" on a Veteran's claim for the second issue).  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the case is REMANDED for the following action:\r\n\r\n(Please note, this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c).  Expedited handling is requested.)\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran should be requested to indicate if he has received any VA or non-VA medical treatment for his psychiatric disorders, lumbar spine disability, brain aneurysm and stroke, left eye impaired vision, a bilateral hip disability, bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and right and left degenerative joint disease that is not evidenced by the current record.  If so, the Veteran should be provided with the necessary authorizations for the release of any treatment records not currently on file, to include the private medical records of Dr. Jackson since February 2008 and Dr. Viesca since July 2010, and the Emergency Department at Sierra Medical Center on July 5, 2003.  These records should then be obtained and associated with the claims folder.  The Veteran should be advised that he may also submit any evidence or further argument relative to the claim at issue.\r\n\r\n2.  The case should be reviewed on the basis of the additional evidence.  If the benefit sought is not granted in full, the Veteran and his representative should be furnished a Supplemental Statement of the Case and be afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond before the record is returned to the Board for further review.\r\n\r\nThe appellant has the right to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter or matters the Board has remanded.  Kutscherousky v. West, 12 Vet. App. 369 (1999).\r\n\r\nThis claim must be afforded expeditious treatment.  The law requires that all claims that are remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action must be handled in an expeditious manner.

Kentucky\n\n\nTHE ISSUE\n\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  \n\n\nREPRESENTATION\n\nVeteran represented by:\tDisabled American Veterans\n\n\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\n\nThe Veteran\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\n\nJohn Francis, Counsel \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran served on active duty from November 1963 to April 1969.  He is the recipient of numerous awards and decorations, to include the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Purple Heart with an Oak Leaf Cluster.\n\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2011 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Louisville, Kentucky, which denied service connection for PTSD.\n\nThe record reflects that the Veteran has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder in addition to PTSD.  The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental health disability that could reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009).  Therefore, the Board has recharacterized the Veteran's claim as shown on the first page of this decision as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD. \n\nIn September 2013, the Veteran testified at a Board hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge sitting at the RO.  A transcript of the hearing is associated with the claims file.  At such time, the Veteran submitted additional evidence consisting of VA treatment records dated through May 2013 with a waiver of RO consideration.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1304(c) (2014).  Therefore, the Board may properly consider such newly received evidence.\n\nThe Board notes that, in addition to the paper claims file, the Veteran also has electronic Virtual VA and Veteran Benefits Management System (VBMS) paperless claims files.  A review of the documents in Virtual VA reveals that, with the exception of a copy of the September 2013 Board hearing transcript and VA treatment records dated through November 2012, which were considered by the RO in the November 2012 supplemental statement of the case, they are either duplicative of the evidence in the paper claims file or are irrelevant to the issue on appeal.  Further, the Veteran's VBMS file does not contain any documents at this time.  \n\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\nResolving all doubt in his favor, the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as PTSD and major depressive disorder, is, at least in part, due to traumatic events during combat in Vietnam.  \n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nThe criteria for service connection for PTSD and major depressive disorder are met.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1154, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 4.125 (2014).  \n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\n\nAs the Board's decision to grant service connection for PTSD and major depressive disorder is completely favorable, no further action is required to comply with the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 and implementing regulations.\n\nThe Veteran served as a U.S. Army infantryman with combat service in the Republic of Vietnam.  He was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Purple Heart with an Oak Leaf Cluster.  He contended in an April 2012 statement and in testimony at the September 2013 Board hearing that he experienced PTSD arising from traumatic events in combat including firefights, mortar and rocket attacks, and observing the deaths of several fellow soldiers.  The Veteran also submitted an undated statement from a fellow soldier (received in September 2013) that confirmed the Veteran's participation in combat action.  \n\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). \n\nDirect service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. Id.; also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) [(table)]. \n\n\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (i.e., in accordance with DSM-IV); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV criteria, a diagnosis of PTSD requires that a Veteran have been exposed to a traumatic event, and that he experience a number of specified current symptoms.  The traumatic event, or stressor, involves having experienced, witnessed, or being confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.  In addition, the response must involve intense feelings of fear, hopelessness, or horror.  See American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. 1994).  In Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140 (1997), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that \"a clear (that is, unequivocal) PTSD diagnosis by a mental-health professional must be presumed (unless evidence shows to the contrary) to have been made in accordance with the applicable DSM criteria as to both the adequacy of the symptomatology and the sufficiency of the stressor.\"\n\nSatisfactory lay or other evidence that an injury or disease was incurred or aggravated in combat will be accepted as sufficient proof of service connection if the evidence is consistent with the circumstances, conditions or hardships of such service even though there is no official record of such incurrence or aggravation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(d); see also Collette v. Brown, 82 F.3d 389 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (under 38 U.S.C.A. §1154(b), a combat Veteran's assertions of an event during combat are to be presumed if consistent with the time, place and circumstances of such service).  In cases where the Veteran engaged in combat, the Federal Circuit has held that the presumption found in § 1154(b) applies not only to the potential cause of a disability, but also to whether a disability itself was incurred while in service. See Reeves v. Shinseki, 682 F.3d 988, 999 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  The combat presumption, however, does not alleviate the requirement that the evidence show current disabilities attributable to the past in-service disorder.  See generally Clyburn v. West, 12 Vet. App. 296, 303 (1999).\n\nThe \"current disability\" requirement for service connection will be met when there is a disability at the time of filing or during the pendency of a claim.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  The Board may also make a factual finding as to whether an earlier diagnosis is sufficiently proximate to the filing of a claim so as to constitute evidence of a \"current diagnosis.\"  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 293-94 (2013).\n\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt is given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  \n\nThe Veteran's service treatment records include the reports of treatment for several combat shrapnel and head injuries.  The records, including the reports of discharge physical examinations in December 1968 and March 1969, are silent for any mental health symptoms, diagnoses, or treatment.  Following his tour of duty in Vietnam, the Veteran received military discipline on many occasions for periods of absence without leave and striking an officer and was under consideration for a discharge for unsatisfactory performance.  In May 1969, a military psychiatrist examined the Veteran and found no underlying medically disqualifying emotional illness.  In a September 2013 statement, the Veteran attributed his post-Vietnam behavior to the onset of PTSD.  The Veteran initially received an other than honorable discharge, which was upgraded to a general discharge under honorable conditions in May 1978.  \n\nRecords of VA outpatient medical care starting in September 2010 show a history of surgery and disabilities of the lower extremities.  Although several PTSD screening questionnaires were negative, the Veteran was referred for a mental health evaluation for symptoms of anxiety and depression.  In a report of a telephone interview in late September 2010, a VA psychologist noted the Veteran's reports of experiencing an unspecified traumatic events and suicidal ideations in the past, and current feelings of lack of energy and interest and difficulty sleeping.  The psychologist also noted symptoms of unspecified disturbing memories, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors.  The psychologist diagnosed a generalized anxiety disorder that \"may meet the criteria for PTSD.\" \n\nTwo days later, the Veteran underwent an in-person mental health examination by a VA psychiatrist.  The Veteran again reported experiencing suicidal and homicidal ideations in the past and olfactory hallucinations of rifle smoke that reminded him of Vietnam.  The Veteran was also experiencing chronic pain from several serious workplace injuries and surgery that forced him to retire and created financial distress.  The psychiatrist diagnosed only a depressive episode without further explanation.  The Veteran began periodic VA outpatient mental health treatment.  In November 2010, the attending psychologist continued to diagnose a depressive disorder, mentioning the Veteran's struggle with VA for benefits and general references to past military experiences.  \n\nThe RO received the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD in November 2010, and the Veteran underwent a VA mental health examination in January 2011.  The VA psychologist did not review the claims file, but found the Veteran to be a reliable historian and noted detailed summaries of the Veteran's combat experiences, post-combat performance problems and discipline, the death of his first wife in 1999, remarriage in 2001 with a supportive relationship, and physical disabilities that caused his retirement in March 2009.  On examination, the psychologist noted the Veteran's report of a \"fair\" mood and difficulty sleeping because of physical pain, but no other deficits.  The psychologist acknowledged that the Veteran's combat experiences would be sufficient to meet the event criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, but that no diagnosis of a mental health disorder was appropriate because the symptoms were limited to expected reactions to stressors such as the death of his first wife and unwanted forced retirement due to medical issues and related financial distress, and not to the events in military service. \n\nThe Veteran stopped VA outpatient mental health treatment in February 2011 but returned to seek primary care in April 2012.  A primary care physician noted the Veteran's reports of irritable mood, flashbacks, and nightmares about his experiences in Vietnam triggered while driving and smelling smoke.  The physician referred the Veteran for further mental health care.  In May 2012, a licensed social worker noted the Veteran's reports of his current family situation and inability to work because of his multiple physical disabilities.  The Veteran reported symptoms of irritability, depression, and interrupted sleep as well as occasional panic attacks, but there was no mention by the Veteran or the examiner of any events in service.  The social worker diagnosed depression associated with adjustment to mobility deficits.  In a follow-up examination the same day, a VA psychiatrist noted that the Veteran's mood was \"down but not overly so\" and that symptoms of PTSD were greatly reduced.  \n\nIn subsequent treatment encounters in July 2012 and August 2012, the attending psychiatrist diagnosed both major depressive disorder and related PTSD with diminishing symptoms that did not interfere with activities.  However, in August 2012, the psychiatrist noted that the Veteran was not depressed on that occasion.  In October 2012, the VA social worker noted some improvement in isolative behaviors, anger issues, and disturbed sleep with the use of medication, but that the Veteran continued to display a depressed mood caused by thoughts of his fellow soldiers killed in Vietnam, how he was treated during service, his physical disabilities, and the death of his first wife.  In November 2012, the Veteran was diagnosed with major depressive disorder.  VA treatment records dated from February 2013 through May 2013 show diagnoses of major depressive disorder and PTSD, and ongoing treatment for such disorders from the Veteran's treating psychiatrist, psychologist, and social worker.\n\nDuring the September 2013 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he was currently under treatment in an intensive program at a VA mental health clinic for PTSD, major depression, and anxiety disorder since April 10, 2013, and that his psychiatrist had associated the disorders with his combat service.  \n\nThe Board finds that service connection for PTSD and major depressive disorder is warranted.  As an initial matter, the Board finds that the Veteran's reports of his traumatic events during combat in Vietnam and current symptoms are competent because they are observable by lay persons and have been accepted without challenge by all clinicians and the January 2011 examiner and are consistent with his service records.  Moreover, as the Veteran served in combat, his lay statements are sufficient to verify his in-service stressors.\n\nThe Board acknowledges that there is competent evidence both for and against a finding that the Veteran has a current psychiatric disorder related to his in-service combat stressors.  The VA psychologist in January 2011 provided a detailed history and comprehensive report of his examination in which he acknowledged the combat events and found that they met the traumatic event criteria.  However, he found that the Veteran did not have any diagnosed psychiatric disorder on that one occasion, but did not have access to or mention the nature of the VA outpatient care that was provided prior to his examination.  \n\nOn the other hand, outpatient clinicians in 2010 diagnosed depression and possible PTSD, albeit with little detailed rationale.  Nevertheless, the clinicians acknowledged the combat events as well as the death of the Veteran's first wife, his workplace injuries and surgery, and his involuntary retirement.  In 2012, the outpatient clinicians affirmatively diagnosed mild symptoms of depression and PTSD without conditional language, but again with little detailed analysis or rationale, referring to both physical disabilities as a cause for depression and combat events as causes for nightmares, intrusive memories, and irritability.  However, beginning in February 2013, VA treatment records reflect diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder, and ongoing treatment for such disorders from the Veteran's treating psychiatrist, psychologist, and social worker.  Moreover, the Veteran's testimony regarding a 2013 intensive mental health treatment program for PTSD, depression, and anxiety, which he reported had been related to his in-service combat stressors, is competent and credible in light of his ongoing treatment for such disorders.  \n\nTherefore, resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence shows that diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder were rendered during portions of the pendency of the Veteran's claim and such were, at least in part, related to traumatic events during combat in Vietnam.  Consequently, service connection for such acquired psychiatric disorders is warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, supra.  \n\n\nORDER\n\nService connection for PTSD and major depressive disorder is granted.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\nA.

However, the Veteran cancelled the request for the hearing.\n\nIn November 2011, the Board remanded this case for further development.  The case has returned to the Board for appellate review.\n\nThe issues of entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the feet, and entitlement to a temporary total disability rating for left great toe surgery, were remanded in November 2011 along with the claim currently on appeal.  Following development conducted pursuant to the Board's November 2011 remand, the AOJ granted service connection and a temporary total disability rating, respectively, for those disorders in a March 2013 rating decision.  As such are complete grants of the benefits sought on appeal, those issues are no longer before the Board.  Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1159 (Fed. Cir. 1997).\n\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\nThe most probative evidence fails to link the Veteran's claimed acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD, to active service or to his service-connected residuals of frostbite.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nThe criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD, to include as secondary to service-connected residuals of frostbite, have not been met.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, 1112, 1131, 1154, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2002 & Supp. 2013); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310 (2013).\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\n\nDuties to Notify and Assist\n\nUnder applicable criteria, VA has certain notice and assistance obligations to claimants.  See 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).\n\nUpon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, VA is required to notify the claimant and his or her representative of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, that is necessary to substantiate the claim.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b).  Proper notice must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b)(1).  Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120-121 (2004).  This notice should be provided prior to an initial unfavorable decision on a claim by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).\n\nVA's notice requirements were satisfied by a September 2012 letter which advised the Veteran of the criteria for establishing service connection and provided him with notice regarding the assignment of disability ratings and effective dates.  The letter was sent prior to the most recent adjudication of the Veteran's claim in March 2013.  Although the letter did not provide the Veteran with notice as to service connection on a secondary basis, he is not prejudiced thereby because he demonstrated actual knowledge of the availability of secondary service connection in his written statements of record.\n\nNext, VA has a duty to assist the Veteran in the development of his claim.  This duty includes assisting him in the procurement of pertinent medical records and providing an examination when necessary.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  In this case, the RO has obtained and associated with the claims file the Veteran's service treatment and personnel records, and records of his post-service VA and private treatment.\n\nThe Veteran has asserted that additional federal records could corroborate his stressor and otherwise support his claim.  Consequently, as outlined in a February 2013 Formal Finding, the RO requested information from the Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) and the US Army Crime Records Center; however, those sources provided negative responses for the requested date range.  Similarly, the Social Security Administration (SSA) issued a negative response in September 2012.  Thus, the Board finds that VA has fulfilled its duty to assist the Veteran in obtaining available federal records.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2).\n\nThe Veteran was afforded an independent medical opinion germane to his claimed disorder on appeal in March 2013.  The examination report is adequate because the clinician based her opinions upon consideration of the Veteran's prior medical history, described the Veteran's symptoms in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation of the claimed disability would be fully informed, and supported all conclusions with analyses that the Board could consider and weigh against any contrary opinions.  Additionally, the independent medical clinician fully described any functional effects caused by the Veteran's claimed disorder.  Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447, 455 (2007).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes that VA made all reasonable efforts to obtain evidence necessary to substantiate the Veteran's claim.  Therefore, no further assistance to the Veteran with the development of evidence is required.\n\n\nService Connection\n\nIn seeking VA disability compensation, a veteran generally seeks to establish that a current disability results from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C.A. § 1131.  \"Service connection\" basically means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with active service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein.\n\nEstablishing direct service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed.Cir.2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F. 3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table).\n\nService connection may also be established for disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) (2012).  Further, a disability which is aggravated by a service-connected disability may be service-connected to the degree that the aggravation is shown.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (2012); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).\n\nService connection for PTSD requires (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); (2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred, unless the stressor is related to a Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).\n\nThe Veteran contends that his psychiatric disorder was caused by service, or by his service-connected residuals of frostbite.  Specifically, in his September 2007 claim, the Veteran asserts that he never experienced mental issues before service, but \"became easily irritated and alarmed during service and it has never diminished.\"\n\nIn his October 2007 stressor statement, the Veteran listed four stressors.  First, he stated that \"I witness[ed] Pvt. [name omitted] trying to kill [an] instructor by drawing his weapon on [an] instructor.\"  Second, he asserted that \"I witness[ed] in Ft. Rucker a group of Privates force bathing another Private with a steel brush.\"  Third, he wrote that \"I witness[ed] a group of Privates giving [a] Private a G.I. Party.  (Blanket Party)....If I had turned them in then I could have been next!\"  Fourth, he averred that \"At Ft. Jackson, [South Carolina] during Basic, one of the trainees dropped a live grenade in the bunker.  This drill sergeant/Instructor jumped on it and was killed.\"  The Veteran concluded that those stressors made it \"hard for me to concentrate on my studies as a Tower Operator.  And that's why I failed the course.\"  In February 2008, the Veteran added that \"I did receive stress counseling in service at Ft. Rucker as I was failing my course.\"\n\nIn his October 2009 substantive appeal, the Veteran added that \"my frostbite residuals...cause me much anxiety and frustration.\"\n\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board finds that the most probative evidence is against a finding of in-service incurrence or aggravation of an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD; there is no credible supporting evidence that any claimed in-service stressor occurred; and the most probative evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's service-connected residuals of frostbite did not cause or aggravate an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD.\n\nAs a finder of fact, when considering whether lay evidence is credible, the Board may properly consider the internal inconsistency of the statements, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the Veteran.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 38 (2007); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).\n\nHere, the multiple contradictions in the Veteran's evidence lead the Board to conclude that the alleged incidents and stressors did not occur.  First, the Veteran expressly denied experiencing psychiatric symptoms in service in his April 1977 and May 1977 Reports of Medical History, wherein he checked boxes indicating that he did not have, and had never had, depression or excessive worry, loss of memory or amnesia, or nervous trouble of any sort.  See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59, 68 (1994) (contemporaneous evidence has greater probative value than subsequently reported history).  Second, in April 1977 and May 1977 Reports of Medical Examination, clinicians found that the Veteran was psychiatrically normal.  See Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet.App. 221, 224 (2011) (noting that where there is a lack of notation of medical condition or symptoms where such notation would normally be expected, the Board may consider this as evidence that the condition or symptoms did not exist).  Third, the Veteran's counseling records were for academics, not stress-as the Veteran inaccurately asserted in a February 2008 letter to VA.  For example, in a June 1977 service personnel record a counselor opined that:\n\nI have personally interviewed this SM and found him to have a good attitude towards the Army.  However, he has a serious academic problem.  His ability to read and comprehend the material in his AIT course is extremely poor, and his exam grades indicated that he will develop[] into a marginal soldier at best.  Recommendation: I don't feel that this SM can obtain an MOS and recommend he be discharged.\n\nSimilarly, the Veteran's own contemporaneous assessment reflected academic, rather than psychiatric, concerns, as described by an in-service supervisor in his service personnel records:\n\nHe says that he doesn't know what the problem is but guesses [that the test is] too hard.  I agree with him-it is too hard for him and he should not be in a service organization where his and other persons' lives may depend upon his ability to respond logically and rapidly to requirements.  He tried the Active Army and could not pass the tests.\n\nFourth, the Veteran's stressor statements to VA clinicians and examiners are often unrelated to, or in direct contradiction with, his stressor statements in support of his claim.  For example, the Veteran told a treating VA psychiatrist in September 2007 that he had not seen the recruit shoot a drill sergeant, but rather had heard about it.  This conflicts with the Veteran's October 2007 stressor statement wherein he stated that \"I witness[ed] Pvt. [name omitted] trying to kill [an] instructor by drawing his weapon on [an] instructor.\"  Additionally, the Veteran told his treating VA psychiatrist in November 2008 that he remembered one surgeon scraping another with a metal brush in service, causing bleeding in his body.  This appears to be a variant of his October 2007 assertion that \"I witness[ed] in Ft. Rucker a group of Privates force bathing another Private with a steel brush.\"  Furthermore, the Veteran told a VA psychologist in August 2007 that he had been revolted and horrified in service by one of his superiors who kept on his desk a large jar of pickled ears from dead NVA and Vietcong soldiers; the Veteran never listed this stressor in his claim.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Board concludes that the Veteran's reports of in-service incidents and stressors lack credibility.\n\nIn March 2013, VA obtained a medical opinion as to the Veteran's claimed PTSD and psychiatric disorders.  The clinician opined that \"It is LESS LIKELY THAN NOT that the Veteran's claimed mental health condition, to include PTSD, incurred, was caused by or proximately due to his 6 months in military service.\"  In support of her opinion, the clinician relied on the absence of verification of the Veteran's stressors; the in-service counseling report showing discharge due to an academic deficiency; and the absence of \"medically based scientific evidence found in his service record to indicate that his short time in military service...[was] the underlying cause of his current diagnoses of PTSD and Depression.\"  The clinician also opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's mental health condition is caused by, proximately due to, or related to his service-connected bilateral lower extremity disabilities, to include peripheral neuropathy and vascular disease, because \"[t]here is no current literature or scientifically based medical evidence to support such a nexus.\"\n\nThe Board finds that the clinician's opinion is competent because she is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1).  Also, the clinician's etiological opinions are credible based on their internal consistency and her duty to provide truthful opinions.  The Board further finds that the March 2013 clinician's opinion is most probative because she considered the Veteran's medical records and discussed his medical history, provided unequivocal and conclusive opinions, and offered clear reasoning for her conclusions.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).\n\nWhere, as here, conflicting competent opinions are of record, the Board can ascribe greater probative weight to one opinion over another, provided that a rational basis is given.  Winsett v. West, 11 Vet. App. 420 (1998), aff'd 217 F.3d 854 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  The Board is cognizant of the February 2008 VA psychologist's letter, the additional VA treatment records, and the December 2012 VA examination report linking the Veteran's PTSD to his service.  However, the Board accords those opinions less probative weight because they are based on acceptance of the Veteran's reported stressors which, as the Board demonstrated above, lack credibility.  Id.\n\nLikewise, the Board finds that the March 2013 VA medical opinion warrants greater probative weight than the Veteran's own contentions, based on the examiner's greater knowledge and expertise, as well as her greater factual accuracy in accordance with the claims file.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).\n\nThe Board further finds that service connection for PTSD is not warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) because the Veteran was not diagnosed with PTSD during service, did not engage in combat with the enemy, did not experience a stressor related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, was not a prisoner-of-war, and did not sustain an in-service personal assault.\n\nThe most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, are unrelated to service or to his service-connected residuals of frostbite.  Accordingly, reasonable doubt does not apply, and the Veteran's appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD, is denied.\n\n\n\nORDER\n\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD, is denied.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\nMICHAEL E.

Whether new and material evidence has been submitted sufficient to reopen a claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n2. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.\n\n\nREPRESENTATION\n\nAppellant represented by:\tDisabled American Veterans\n\n\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\n\nAppellant\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\n\nDustin Ware, Associate Counsel\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran had active military service from March 1973 to August 1974.  \n\nThis case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a March 2010 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Little Rock, Arkansas.  \n\nThe Veteran testified before the Board at a September 2013 hearing at the RO.  A transcript of the hearing is of record.\n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n1. A November 2005 Board decision denied the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  The Veteran was notified of his appellate rights, but did not complete an appeal of the Board decision.\n\n2. Evidence received since the November 2005 Board decision is not cumulative of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior denial as it relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim of service connection for PTSD and raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the Veteran's claim of service connection.\n\n3. The competent evidence of record demonstrates the Veteran suffers from PTSD due to the circumstances of his active service.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n1. The November 2005 Board decision that denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is final.  38 U.S.C.A. § 7266 (West 2002).\n\n2. Evidence received since the November 2005 Board decision, in connection with Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, is new and material; the claim is reopened.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5108 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (2014).\n\n3. PTSD was incurred as a result of active duty service.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1110 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304(f) (2014).\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nDuties to Notify and Assist\n\nSince the entire benefit sought on appeal has been granted, no purpose would be served by undertaking an analysis of whether there has been compliance with the notice and duty to assist requirements set out at 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5100, 5102-5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 (West 2002).  See, e.g., Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384 (1993); VAOPGCPREC 16-92, 57 Fed. Reg. 49,747 (1992).\n\nAnalysis\n\nUnder 38 U.S.C.A. § 7104, Board decisions must be based on the entire record, with consideration of all the evidence.  The law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant.  Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000).  The Board must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000).\n\nVA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.\n\nI. Claim to Reopen\n\nThe previous final denial of the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is a November 2005 Board decision.  A VA Form 4597, Board of Veterans' Appeals Notice, was attached to that decision and neither the Veteran, nor a representative, filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.  Therefore, the Board's November 2005 decision became final.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 7104, 7266 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100 (2014).\n\nA final decision cannot be reopened unless new and material evidence is presented. 38 U.S.C.A. § 5108.  The Secretary must reopen a finally disallowed claim when new and material evidence is presented or secured with respect to that claim. Knightly v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 200 (1994).\n\nNew evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decision makers.  Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.  New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).\n\nThe threshold for determining whether new and material evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating a claim is \"low.\"  See Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110, 117 (2010).  Furthermore, consideration is not limited to whether the newly submitted evidence relates specifically to the reason the claim was last denied, but instead should include whether the evidence could reasonably substantiate the claim were the claim to be reopened, either by triggering the Secretary's duty to assist or through consideration of an alternative theory of entitlement.  Id. at 118.\n\nOnly evidence presented since the last final denial on any basis (either upon the merits of the case, or upon a previous adjudication that no new and material evidence has been presented) will be evaluated in the context of the entire record.  Evans v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 273 (1996).  Finally, for the purpose of establishing whether new and material evidence has been received, the credibility of the evidence, but not its weight, is to be presumed.  Justus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 513 (1992).\n\nThe evidence received since the November 2005 Board decision includes statements by the Veteran, statements by the Veteran's wife and by acquaintances of the Veteran, non-VA treatment records, VA treatment records, multiple VA examinations, records of job performance counseling, a record of a Defense Personnel Records Information Retrieval System (DPRIS) inquiry, and a Board hearing transcript.  Significantly, an October 2010 VA examination diagnosed PTSD based on a stressor that is verified by the DPRIS inquiry when viewed in light of other evidence of record.\n\nTherefore, the Board concludes that the Veteran's October 2010 VA examination and the DPRIS inquiry are new and material with respect to the issue of service connection for PTSD.  The evidence is new as it has not previously been included in the record.  This evidence is material as it relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim, namely evidence of a diagnosis of PTSD based on a verified stressor.  Furthermore, this evidence is not cumulative or redundant and raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the Veteran's claim of service connection and, thus, constitutes new and material evidence.  See Shade, 24 Vet. App. at 118.  Consequently, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, must be reopened.\n  \n\n\nII. Service Connection\n\nThe Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for an acquired psychiatric disorder, specifically PTSD due to stressors that occurred during active duty service.  \n\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (2014); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).  In this case, the Veteran contends that multiple noncombat-related stressors occurred at Fort Sill, Oklahoma causing his PTSD.  As the Veteran's claimed stressor does not involve being engaged in combat with the enemy, his lay testimony alone is not enough to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressors.  See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996), Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 166 (1996).  To that end, the record must contain service records or other corroborative evidence that substantiates or verifies the Veteran's statements as to the occurrence of the claimed stressor(s).  See West (Carlton) v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 70, 76 (1994); Zarycki v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 91, 98 (1993).\n\nIn the instant case, the record contains a difference of opinion as to whether the Veteran's symptomatology supports a diagnosis of PTSD.  In this regard, the Board observes that a February 2005 non-VA treatment note from a Dr. S. indicates a diagnosis of PTSD.  Axis I diagnoses of PTSD are throughout the Veteran's VA treatment records.  June 2008, March 2009, July 2009, June 2010, and October 2010 VA Treatment Notes.  Alternatively, a January 2009 VA examiner stated \"[w]hile the veteran does display some symptoms which would be consistent with a posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis, the severity, intensity, and specificity does not at this time meet criteria for a full diagnosis.\"  A January 2010 VA examination for mental disorders, other than PTSD and eating disorders, noted no \"evidence of another psychiatric disorder in today's examination other than posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, but they were not fully evaluated.\"  \n\nIn light of this, an October 2010 VA examiner was asked to address the conflicting evidence.  The VA examiner opined that a \"veteran can have PTSD symptoms which are present, but not at a severity of frequency necessary to meet diagnostic criteria.\"  The VA examiner's rational points towards this being the case in the previous VA examinations.  Additionally, the VA examiner makes a specific note of the fact that the January 2010 VA examination was not for PTSD and, as admitted by the VA examiner who performed the exam, the PTSD symptoms were not fully evaluated.  Concerning the private treatment records it was noted that they \"related stressor to military service but did not provide enough specifics to show diagnostic criteria was met.\"  Whatever the case was previously, the VA examiner concluded that the October 2010 VA examination revealed the Veteran presently \"presenting symptoms in sufficient frequency and severity to meet diagnostic criteria\" for a diagnosis of PTSD.  \n\nFinally, the Veteran has been consistently diagnosed with a depressive disorder.  A June 2012 VA examiner was asked to comment on how a depressive disorder is related to the now diagnosed PTSD.  The VA examiner responded that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  Specifically noting the Veteran did not adequately display Criterion C (persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness) and Criterion D (persistent symptoms of increased arousal, not present before the trauma).  \n\nIn deciding whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD, it is the responsibility of the Board to weigh the evidence and decide where to give credit and where to withhold the same and, in so doing, accept certain medical opinions over others.  Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 (1998).  That responsibility is particularly onerous where medical opinions diverge.  At the same time, the Board is mindful that it cannot make its own independent medical determinations and that there must be plausible reasons for favoring one medical opinion over another.  Id.; see also Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App 171 (1991). \n\nIn considering the evidence in its entirety, and resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds the Veteran is currently diagnosed with PTSD.  The January 2009 and June 2012 VA examiner find the Veteran displays symptoms of PTSD but not the severity or intensity required for a diagnosis.  This weighs against finding a diagnosis.  The January 2010 examination was for depression and not for PTSD; nevertheless, PTSD symptoms were observed but not fully evaluated.  As PTSD symptoms were not fully evaluated this examination weighs little in finding either for or against a diagnosis of PTSD.  The October 2011 VA examination, the Veteran's VA treatment records, and the non-VA treatment records of Dr. S all weigh in favor of a diagnosis of PTSD.  The Board acknowledges that the October 2010 VA examiner noted that private treatment records related stressors to military service but did not provide enough specifics to show diagnostic criteria for PTSD were met.  However, the Board notes that a \"PTSD diagnosis by a mental-health professional must be presumed (unless evidence shows to the contrary) to have been made in accordance with the applicable DSM criteria as to both the adequacy of the symptomatology and the sufficiency of the stressor.\"  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140 (1997).  Further, \"mental health professionals are experts and are presumed to know the DSM requirements applicable to their practice and to have taken them into account in providing a PTSD diagnosis.\"  Id.  As such, the Board finds the evidence is at least in equipoise regarding a current diagnosis of PTSD; therefore, the Board has determined that a current diagnosis of PTSD is present in the instant case.  \n\nNext, the Board must determine whether the record establishes that the Veteran's reported in-service stressors occurred.  As noted Veteran contends that multiple noncombat-related stressors occurred at Fort Sill, Oklahoma causing his PTSD.  The most important of these stressors is the death, by motor vehicle accident, of Sergeant W.C.B.  The Veteran reports witnessing the incident.  Veteran's Statement Titled \"Life in The Army\" received October 2009, January 2009 Veteran's Statement.  The Veteran notes that he regularly interacted with Sergeant W.C.B. because they were friends and this enhanced the emotional impact of his death.  Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection PSTD received January 2007.\n\nWhen it comes to verifying the stressor a September 2011 DPRIS inquiry determined a Sergeant W.C.B died, while a passenger of a government vehicle, around the time the Veteran claims to have witnessed the accident.  The DPRIS inquiry could not confirm the location of the death other than that it occurred in the United States.  However, an undated news article submitted by the Veteran reveals that Sergeant W.C.B. died at Fort Sill in a motor vehicle accident.  Additionally, an October 2010 statement from M.W., Jr., who claims to have witnessed the incident, indicates the Veteran was present and witnessed the accident.  With this in mind, the Board finds the Veteran lay testimony is supported by credible evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  \n\nThe remaining question, therefore, is whether there is competent medical evidence linking the Veteran's PTSD to his in-service stressor.  In diagnosing PTSD, the October 2011 VA examiner specifically noted two in-service stressors that contributed to the PTSD diagnosis.  One of the stressors was the death of a Sergeant by motor vehicle accident.  \n\nIn Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) found that \"a Veteran need only demonstrate that there is an 'approximate balance of positive and negative evidence' in order to prevail.\" Further, the Court specifically stated that entitlement need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing evidence, or by a fair preponderance of the evidence.  Under the benefit of the doubt doctrine established by Congress, when the evidence is in \"relative equipoise, the law dictates that the Veteran prevails.\"  Id.   \n\nTherefore, as discussed above, affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt he is currently diagnosed with PTSD.  Furthermore, the October 2011 VA examination links the Veteran PTSD diagnosis to the in-service stressor reported by the Veteran.  Finally, the Board finds Veteran's lay testimony in regards to his in-service stressor is supported by credible evidence of record.  Consequently, resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds service connection for PTSD is warranted, and the Veteran's claim is granted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).\n \n\n\n\nORDER\n\nNew and material evidence having been submitted, the claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is reopened.\n\nService connection for PTSD is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits.\n\n\n      \n\n____________________________________________\nMILO H.

Entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disability, to include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n\nREPRESENTATION\n\nAppellant represented by:\tThe American Legion\n\n\nWITNESSES AT HEARING ON APPEAL\n\nAppellant\n\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\n\nE. D. Anderson, Counsel\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran had active service from November 1965 to November 1967.\n\nThis appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2008 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Nashville, Tennessee, which denied the Veteran's claims for service connection for PTSD and COPD.  \n\nIn September 2009, the Veteran testified at a hearing at the RO in Atlanta, Georgia, before a Decision Review Officer (DRO).  A copy of the transcript has been associated with the record. \n\nIn his October 2009 VA Form 9 (substantive appeal), the Veteran requested a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge in Washington, DC at the Central Office.  A hearing was scheduled for him in February 2011, and the Veteran was notified via an October 2010 letter.  However, he failed to report at his scheduled time and thus far has not offered any explanation for his absence.  Accordingly, the Board will adjudicate the Veteran's appeal as if the hearing request had been withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. § 20.704(d) (2014).\n\nThe Board considers the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD as encompassing all psychiatric disorders evident in the record, pursuant to the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009) (holding that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental health disability that could reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record).\n\nIn addition, regarding the Veteran's claim for a respiratory disorder, the Board notes that the Veteran originally claimed service connection for COPD.  However, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) and private medical treatment records reveal that the Veteran has been diagnosed with and treated for a cough along with sinusitis and bronchitis.  In Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79 (2009) the Court extended the holding of Clemons to include disabilities outside of psychiatric disorders.  At this time, in order to comply with the above case-law and allow the broadest possible interpretation of his claims in light of the evidence of record, the Board has revised the Veteran's original claim in the title page.  In doing so, the Board is defining the Veteran's original claim to include all manifestations of his respiratory disorders as evident in the record.\n\nIn April 2011, the Board remanded this matter to the RO via the Appeals Management Center (AMC) in Washington, D.C. to provide the Veteran with VCAA notice and to afford the Veteran VA medical examinations.  The action specified in the April 2011 Remand completed, the matter has been properly returned to the Board for appellate consideration.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998). \n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n1.  The Veteran's reported in service stressor has been corroborated.  \n\n2.  The Veteran has an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, that was caused by the Veteran's active military service.  \n\n3.  The Veteran's current respiratory disability did not have onset during the Veteran's active service and was not caused or permanently aggravated by his active military service.  \n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n1.  The criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) based on personal assault, have been met.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 101, 1110, 1112 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (2014).  \n\n2.  The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disability, to include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), have not been met.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 101, 1110, 1112 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (2014).  \n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe Board has reviewed all of the evidence in the claims folder, including all virtual records.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the extensive evidence of record.  Indeed, the Federal Circuit has held that the Board must review the entire record, but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  Therefore, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to these claims.  \n\nThe Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant.  Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value.  When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the appellant prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).\n\nService Connection\n\nService connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (2014).  In general, service connection requires competent and credible evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\n\nUnder 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), an alternative method of establishing the second and third elements is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); see Savage v. Gober 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-97 (1997); see also Clyburn v. West, 12 Vet. App. 296, 302 (1999).  Continuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant can demonstrate (1) that a condition was \"noted\" during service; (2) evidence of post- service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology.  Savage, 10 Vet. App. at 495-96; see Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (lay evidence of in-service incurrence is sufficient in some circumstances for purposes of establishing service connection); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  \n\nPTSD\n\nEstablishing service connection for PTSD requires specific findings.  These are (1) a current medical diagnosis of PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in- service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a causal nexus between current symptomatology and the specific claimed in- service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) (2014).  The diagnosis of PTSD must comply with the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV).  Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (2014).\n\nIf PTSD is based on personal assault, as alleged in this case, evidence from sources other than the veteran's records may corroborate the occurrence of the stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3).  Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, mental health counseling centers, hospitals or physicians; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  Id. \n\nEvidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in the mentioned sources.  Examples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include, but are not limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes.  Id. \n\nThe Veteran claims that he currently experiences PTSD due to events that occurred during his military service.  See, e.g., Veteran's April 2008 claim.  The Veteran has alleged that, during basic training, he was subject to abuse, harassment, and hazing by a corporal whose name he does not recall who was assisting the Veteran's drill instructors; in essence alleging that he experienced personal assaults during his military service.  See Veteran's April and July 2008 stressor statements, October 2009 VA Form 9, and DRO hearing transcript pages 1-2, 5-6.  The Veteran has indicated that the corporal abused him by forcing him to take a cold shower for one-half to one-and-a-half hours, striking him in the back of the head with a steel pot and helmet liner, and kicking him in the calf or leg.  Id.; see also July 2008 stressor statement and DRO hearing transcript pg. 2.  The Veteran further indicated that the corporal would return from town drunk and assault him, including throwing him out of his cot.  See Veteran's July 2008 stressor statement, and DRO hearing transcript pg. 2.  The Veteran has indicated that he threatened to report the corporal to the commanding officer, but the corporal threatened him with a court martial and punishment in the stockade if he persisted with his report, and the Veteran was afraid to fight back at the time.  Id.  The Veteran has also indicated that he tried to attack the corporal but \"the tables got turned.\"  Id.  \n\nThe Veteran has indicated that he had managed to put this history behind him after service, but, in the last four to five years, he has begun to experience bad dreams wherein he attempts to kill the corporal, and that he has attacked his wife in his sleep due to these dreams.  See Veteran's April and July 2008 stressor statements, and DRO hearing transcript pg. 2; see also private treatment record dated in May 2007 from B. W. R., MD.  \n\nAs an initial matter, there is some uncertainty as to whether the Veteran has a current PTSD diagnosis.  In May 2011, a VA psychologist, Dr. L.K., concluded that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for PTSD, but rather diagnosed the Veteran with alcohol dependence in partial remission, cocaine abuse in reported admission, and a personality disorder not otherwise specified with Cluster B traits.  She affirmed these findings in a September 2012 addendum report.  However, the Veteran's current treating psychiatrist, Dr. H.V., has diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and major depression, which she has attributed to the Veteran's claimed in service stressors.  \n\nThe Board has weighed the fact that at least one of the Veteran's treatment providers, Dr. H.V., has found him credible in his account of in-service hazing.  This may be considered in the Board's evaluation of the evidence.   See Menegassi v. Shinseki, 638 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (\"under 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5), medical opinion evidence may be submitted for use in determining whether the occurrence of a stressor is corroborated.\")  \n\nUnder the benefit of the doubt rule, where there exists \"an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter,\" the Veteran shall prevail upon the issue.  Ashley v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 52, 59 (1993); see also Massey v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 204, 206-207 (1994).  Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, has been established.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  \n\nRespiratory Disability\n\nThe Veteran has also alleged that he currently experiences a respiratory disorder that is due to his military service.  See Veteran's April 2008 claim.  Specifically, he has indicated that he was treated for his current disorder during his military service.  \n\nService treatment records do show that in May and August 1966, the Veteran was treated for a cold along with chest pain, coughing, and vomiting.  Then, in January 1967, he was treated for nasal issues, and in March 1967, he was diagnosed with sinusitis.  Finally, in September 1967, at the time of his separation examination, the Veteran provided a statement of his medical history wherein it was noted that he had a history of mild sinusitis that \"responds to meds.\"  The AOJ has also obtained private treatment records from Dr. Ramsey, which indicate a diagnosis of acute sinusitis and bronchitis in October 2006, and treatment for a cough in February and March 2009.  VA outpatient treatment records show diagnoses of COPD, emphysema, and tobacco use disorder.  See, e.g., VA Primary Care Physician Note (March 26, 2012).\n\nThe Veteran has also alleged that his respiratory disorder is due to smoking due to stresses incurred during his military service.  See Veteran's April 2008 claim, July 2008 stressor statement, and DRO hearing transcript pg. 8.  The Board notes that, for claims received by VA after June 9, 1998, a disability or death will not be considered service-connected on the basis that it resulted from injury or disease attributable to the Veteran's use of tobacco products during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.300(a).  The provisions of § 3.300(a), however, do not prohibit service connection if the disability resulted from a disease that can be service-connected on some basis other than the Veteran's use of tobacco products during service, or if the disability became manifest during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.300(b)(1).\n\nTo address whether the Veteran's current respiratory problems were related to his in-service treatment or otherwise caused by his military service, the matter was referred for a VA medical opinion.  In an April 2011 opinion, a VA examiner concluded that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's in-service treatment for colds and sinusitis is related to any current respiratory condition.  The examiner explained that the Veteran was treated in service for upper respiratory infections, which are a common illness and not indicative of a chronic disability.  The examiner further opined that the cause of the Veteran's lung disorder is likely a long history of heavy smoking.  However, the examiner explained that \"The Veteran's current respiratory disorder is related to his admitted history of use of tobacco products during military service only in the sense that he was a smoker then.  The current lung condition reflects many, many, pack/years of smoking.\"\n\nBased on the above evidence, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disability is denied.  As the Board has noted above, for claims received by VA after June 9, 1998, a disability or death will not be considered service-connected on the basis that it resulted from injury or disease attributable to the Veteran's use of tobacco products during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.300(a).  Here, the Veteran's current respiratory problems have been attributed to his lengthy history of heavy smoking by the April 2011 VA examiner, and the Veteran has not submitted any evidence to the contrary.  Accordingly, service connection for the Veteran's respiratory disability must denied pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.300(a).  \n\nFurthermore, although the April 2011 VA examiner considered whether the Veteran's treatment for colds and sinusitis on several occasions during his active service was evidence of a chronic disability, the examiner explained that upper respiratory infections such as the Veteran was treated for are a common illness and his treatment for it in service should not be considered evidence of a chronic disability.  The examiner concluded that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's current respiratory problems had onset in service or were caused by or related the Veteran's active military service.  Again, the Veteran has not submitted any medical evidence to the contrary.  While current VA and private treatment records reflect treatment for a number of respiratory complaints, none of the Veteran's treatment provider has opined that these conditions are related to the Veteran's service.  \n\nIn addition, the April 2011 examiner opined that \"I can see no evidence that any aspect of his military service caused his current lung condition . . . separate from his history of use of tobacco products.\" (emphasis added).  Thus, there is no indication that anything in service could have potentially caused or aggravated his respiratory disorder, aside from his use of tobacco products.  Moreover, the examiner opined that there were no \"intercurrent ([o]ccuring in addition to and usually altering the course of another disease) causes unrelated to his military service.\"  Although the Board has now service-connected the Veteran's PTSD, there is no indication that this disability has aggravated the Veteran's respiratory disability.  \n\nTo the extent that the Veteran has offered his own opinion concerning the etiology of his respiratory disability, he has not demonstrated that he has any knowledge or training in determining the etiology of such conditions.  In other words, he is a layman, not a medical expert.  The Board recognizes that there is no bright line rule that laypersons are not competent to offer etiology opinions.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (rejecting the view that competent medical evidence is necessarily required when the determinative issue is medical diagnosis or etiology).  Evidence, however, must be competent evidence in order to be weighed by the Board.  Whether a layperson is competent to provide an opinion as to the etiology of a condition depends on the facts of the particular case.\n\nIn Davidson, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) drew support from Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007) for support for its holding.  Id.  In a footnote in Jandreau, the Federal Circuit addressed whether a layperson could provide evidence regarding a diagnosis of a condition and explained that \"[s]ometimes the layperson will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\n\nAlthough the Veteran seeks to offer etiology opinions rather than provide diagnoses, the reasoning expressed in Jandreau is applicable.  The Board finds that the question of whether the Veteran currently has a respiratory disability due to his active military service is too complex to be addressed by a layperson.  This connection or etiology is not amenable to observation alone.  Rather it is common knowledge that such relationships are the subject of extensive research by scientific and medical professionals.  Hence, the Veteran's opinion of the etiology of his current disability is entitled to little to no probative weight.  The Board gives greater weight to the contemporaneous medical evidence and the opinion of the VA examiner.\n\nAlthough the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's argument that he began smoking in service due, in part, to the cigarettes he was provided by the military, Congress has spoken to this issue in 38 U.S.C.A. § 1103, and prohibited service connection for disabilities based upon effects of tobacco products.  The Board is obligated to follow the dictates of Congress, without regard to its own view of the matter.  \n\nFor all the above reasons, entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disability, to include COPD, is denied.  The evidence in this case is not so evenly balanced so as to allow application of the benefit-of- the-doubt rule.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (2014).\n\nThe Duty to Notify and Assist\n\nUnder the Veterans Claims Assistance Act (VCAA), when VA receives a complete or substantially complete application for benefits, it must notify the claimant of the information and evidence not of record that is necessary to substantiate a claim, which information and evidence VA will obtain, and which information and evidence the claimant is expected to provide.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (2014).  Here, the Veteran was provided with the relevant notice and information.  Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112, 120-21 (2004) (Pelegrini II).  He has not alleged any notice deficiency during the adjudication of his claim.  Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009).\n\nVA also has a duty to assist the Veteran in obtaining potentially relevant records, and providing an examination or medical opinion when necessary to make a decision on the claim.  Here, the Veteran's service records, VA records, and identified private treatment records have been obtained and associated with the claims file.  The Veteran was also provided with VA examinations which, collectively, contain a description of the history of the disabilities at issue; document and consider the relevant medical facts and principles; and provide opinions regarding the etiology of the Veteran's claimed conditions.  VA's duty to assist with respect to obtaining relevant records and an examination has been met.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).\n\nFinally, the Veteran testified at an RO hearing.  The hearing was adequate as the DRO who conducted the hearing explained the issue and identified possible sources of evidence that may have been overlooked.  38 C.F.R. 3.103(c)(2); Bryant v.

psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n\nREPRESENTATION\n\nAppellant represented by:\tMary M. Markovich, Attorney\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\n\nChristine C. Kung, Counsel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran served on active duty from January 1977 to January 1981.\n\nThis matter comes on appeal before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2009 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (RO).  \n\nThe Board remanded the appeal in September 2011 to obtain private psychiatric treatment records and to attempt to verify the Veteran's stressor thorough the Irvine Police Department.  The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) substantially complied with the remand order, and the Board finds that it may proceed with a decision at this time.  See Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-47 (1999) (remand not required under Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998), where the Board's remand instructions were substantially complied with), aff'd, Dyment v. Principi, 287 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2002).\n\nIn an April 2014 decision, the Board denied service connection for PTSD.  The Veteran appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court or CAVC).  In July 2015, the Court vacated that Board's decision and remanded the case to the Board for readjudication in compliance with a July 2015 Joint Motion.  The Court found that the Board erred by failing to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its findings as to the credibility and probative value of the accounts of the Veteran and Gunnery Sergeant W.C. with regard to an in-service assault.  The appeal is once again before the Board for review.  \n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n1.  An in-service stressor sufficient to cause PTSD is corroborated by evidence of record. \n\n2.  The Veteran has a current DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD.\n\n3.  Currently diagnosed PTSD is related to a verified in-service stressor.\n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nResolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for service connection for PTSD are met.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, 1110, 5107, 5121 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2015).\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\n\nDuties to Notify and Assist\n\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations impose obligations on VA to provide claimants with notice and assistance in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5126 (West 2002 & Supp. 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.326(a) (2014).  The Board is granting service connection for PTSD.  Because this decision constitutes a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal, no further discussion regarding VCAA notice or assistance duties is required. \n\nService Connection Laws and Regulations\n\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); \nsee also Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999), citing Caluza v. Brown, \n7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  In this case, PTSD is not a \"chronic diseases\" listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) and the Veteran has not been diagnosed with psychosis; therefore, the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) do not apply.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  \n\nIn adjudicating a claim for service connection for PTSD, the Board is required to evaluate evidence based on places, types, and circumstances of service, as shown by the veteran's military records and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.  Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 66 (1993); see also 38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. \n§ 3.304(f).  The evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of an in-service stressor for PTSD will vary depending on whether or not the veteran \"engaged in combat with the enemy.\"  Id.  \n\nIf VA determines that a veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and that the alleged stressor is related to combat, then the veteran's lay testimony or statements are accepted as conclusive evidence of the occurrence of the claimed stressor. \n38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).  No further development or corroborative evidence is required, provided that the claimed stressor is \"consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service.\"  Id.  \n\nIf, however, VA determines that the veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy or that the alleged stressor is not related to combat, the veteran's lay testimony by itself is not sufficient to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  Instead, the record must contain service records or other evidence to corroborate the veteran's testimony or statements.  See Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 394 (1996). \n\nThe question of whether a veteran was exposed to a stressor in service is a factual one, and VA adjudicators are not bound to accept uncorroborated accounts of stressors or medical opinions based upon such accounts.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991), aff'd on reconsideration, 1 Vet. App. 406 (1991).  Hence, whether a stressor was of sufficient gravity to cause or support a diagnosis of PTSD is a question of fact for medical professionals and whether the evidence establishes the occurrence of stressors is a question of fact for adjudicators. \n\nThe law provides that, if a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records may corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor incident.  Gallegos v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 329 (2008).  Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy. Evidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources.  Examples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include, but are not limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3). \n\nAdditionally, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f), VA can submit any evidence, including alternate source evidence, to a medical or mental health professional for interpretation. Bradford v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 200 (2006).  Most significantly, for claims involving an in-service personal assault, after-the-fact medical evidence can be used to establish a stressor.  Id; Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272, 278 (1999).\n\nIf a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3).  \n\nIn rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40   (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).  Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (\"although interest may affect the credibility of testimony, it does not affect competency to testify\").\n\nService Connection Analysis\n\n\nThe Veteran contends in various lay statements, to include an August 2009 stressor statement that in November 1977, while stationed in El Toro, California, he went to a pub off base to play pool, and was threatened with death by a man with a rifle.  In a later September 2010 statement, the Veteran identified the name of the pub as Peyton Place.  The Board finds that the Veteran has claimed service connection for PTSD due to non-combat stressors; therefore, the claimed stressor must be corroborated by credible supporting evidence.  See Moreau, 9 Vet. App. 389.\n\nAfter a review of all the evidence, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise on the question of whether the Veteran's claimed in-service stressor of an in-service assault has been corroborated by the evidence of record.  The Board finds that the Veteran is competent to describe the in-service assault with a deadly weapon, and the Board finds that the Veteran's statements and testimony are credible as his descriptions of such events have been consistent throughout the record.  While the RO attempted to corroborate the Veteran's testimony through official sources, service personnel records do not confirm the Veteran's report of the incident in November 1977, and correspondence with the Irvine Police Department dated in November 2010 and November 2012 shows that they do not keep records of assaults for more than 10 years.  The Board finds, however, that the Veteran has provided sufficient corroborating evidence in the form of lay statements provided by Gunnery Sargent W.C.  A March 2009 statement from W.C. shows that he and the Veteran were stationed together in El Toro, California in 1977, and that they went to the pub together to play pool during the incident in question.  W.C. more recently submitted a notarized affidavit in November 2015 in which he describes the same incident in more detail.  W.C.'s statements indicate that while he and the Veteran were playing pool, a civilian stranger came up to the Veteran and started acting aggressively.  In response, the Veteran prepared to leave and return to base and was in the parking lot when the stranger pulled a rifle out of the trunk of his car, pointed it at the Veteran, and told him, \"Today, you are going to die.\"  W.C. stated that he witnessed the incident from the doorway of the pub.  The bartender was able to talk the man down, and the Veteran and W.C. ran back to base while he was distracted.  They reported the incident to the Barrack Sergeant, who was later informed that the police had been called and removed the man from the premises.  The Board finds that W.C.'s statement corroborates the occurrence of the Veteran's reported in-service assault.  Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the reported in-service stressful event of an in-service assault has been corroborated by lay evidence of record.\n\nThe Veteran has a current DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD related to the verified in-service assault.  Service treatment records do not reflect any psychiatric treatment or complaints.  Private treatment records from Dr. E.H. show that the Veteran was initially evaluated for PTSD in March 2009.  At that time, he described his in-service stressor of being threatened with a gun and reported the onset of nightmares in 1977.  In the initial evaluation and in a more comprehensive September 2011 evaluation, the Veteran was assessed with chronic PTSD and chronic major depression, related to the verified in-service assault.  The Veteran was treated by Dr. E.H. with medication management and psychotherapy.  Progress notes from Dr. E.H. are of record.  An additional October 2015 PTSD evaluation, completed by Dr. E.M. is also of record.  \n\nThe Board finds that the diagnoses of PTSD related to a verified in-service stressor provided by the Veteran's treating psychiatrist, when considered psychiatric treatment records, is probative as it was based on an accurate factual background, a discussion of the Veteran's in-service stressful incident, and psychiatric evaluation of the Veteran.  See Reonal, 5 Vet. App. at 461; Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (holding \"It is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion, not the mere fact that the claims file was reviewed, that contributes probative value to a medical opinion\").  Dr. E.H. has provided DSM-IV diagnoses of PTSD related to the Veteran's in-service personal assault.  For these reasons, and resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the criteria for service connection for PTSD with depression have been met.  38 U.S.C.A.  § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (2015).\n\n\nORDER\n\nService connection for PTSD with depression is granted.  \n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\nK.

A hearing transcript is of record.  In June 2015, the Board sent the Veteran a letter asking if he desired a hearing before another VLJ.  In the same month, the Veteran submitted correspondence indicating he did not desire an additional hearing.\n\nWhile the information of record generally indicates that Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW) represents the Veteran, he appeared at his September 2013 hearing with an agent of The American Legion.  In September 2015, the Board sent the Veteran a letter asking him to clarify who he wished to represent him before the Board.  In response thereto the Veteran submitted a newly executed VA Form 21-22 in favor of VFW.  As such, the Board recognizes the Veteran as currently represented by that entity.\n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n1.  At no time during the pendency of the claim does the Veteran have a current diagnosis of PTSD, and the record does not contain a recent diagnosis of such disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim.\n\n\n2.  An acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD is not shown to be causally or etiologically related to any disease, injury, or incident during service.\n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nThe criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, have not been met.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2015).\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\n\nI.  Veteran's Claims Assistance Act\n\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations impose obligations on VA to provide claimants with notice and assistance.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2015).  Proper VCAA notice must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b)(1).  \n\nIn Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the VCAA notice requirements of 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b) apply to all five elements of a service connection claim.  Those five elements include: 1) Veteran status; 2) existence of a disability; 3) a connection between the Veteran's service and the disability; 4) degree of disability; and 5) effective date of the disability.  \n\nIn Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004), the Court held that a VCAA notice, as required by 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a), must be provided to a claimant before the initial unfavorable agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on the claim for VA benefits.  \n\nIn the instant case, the Board finds that VA has satisfied its duty to notify under the VCAA.  Specifically, an October 2008 letter, sent prior to the initial unfavorable decision issued in December 2008 advised the Veteran of the evidence and information necessary to substantiate his service connection claim as well as his and VA's respective responsibilities in obtaining such evidence and information.  Additionally, such letter advised him of the information and evidence necessary to establish a disability rating and an effective date in accordance with Dingess/Hartman, supra.  \n\nThe VCAA also requires VA to make reasonable efforts to help a claimant obtain evidence necessary to substantiate his claim.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§§ 3.159(c), (d).  This \"duty to assist\" contemplates that VA will help a claimant obtain records relevant to his claim, whether or not the records are in Federal custody, and that VA will provide a medical examination or obtain an opinion when necessary to make a decision on the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).\n\nIn this regard, the Veteran's service treatment and personnel records as well as post-service VA treatment records have been obtained and considered.  The Veteran has not identified any additional, outstanding records that have not been requested or obtained.  \n\nThe Veteran was also afforded a VA examination in March 2015 with respect to the issue decided herein.  The Board finds that such VA examination and accompanying opinion is adequate to decide the issue as they are predicated on an interview with the Veteran; a review of the record, to include his service treatment records; and a mental status examination.  The opinion proffered considered all of the pertinent evidence of record, to include the statements of the Veteran, and provided a complete rationale, relying on and citing to the records reviewed.  Moreover, the examiner offered clear conclusions with supporting data as well as reasoned medical explanations connecting the two.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (\"[A]medical opinion ... must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions\").  Accordingly, the Board finds that VA's duty to assist with respect to obtaining a VA examination and opinion regarding the issue decided herein has been met.  \n\nAdditionally, in September 2013, the Veteran was provided an opportunity to set forth his contentions during the hearing before a now-retired Veterans Law Judge.  In Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488 (2010), the Court held that 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2) requires that the Decision Review Officer or Veterans Law Judge who chairs a hearing to fulfill two duties: (1) the duty to fully explain the issues and (2) the duty to suggest the submission of evidence that may have been overlooked. \n\nHere, during the September 2013 hearing, the presiding Veterans Law Judge noted the issue on appeal.  Also, information was solicited regarding the Veteran's in-service experiences he alleges resulted in his psychiatric disorder, the type and onset of symptoms, relevant treatment, and her contention that his military service caused his psychiatric disorder.  Therefore, not only was the issue \"explained . . . in terms of the scope of the claim for benefits,\" but \"the outstanding issues material to substantiating the claim,\" were also fully explained.  See Bryant, 23 Vet. App. at 497.  In light of the Veteran's testimony, the presiding Veterans Law Judge remanded the matter in order to obtain updated VA treatment records and afford him a VA examination so as to determine the nature and etiology of his acquired psychiatric disorder.  Under these circumstances, nothing gives rise to the possibility that evidence had been overlooked with regard to the Veteran's claim decided herein.  As such, the Board finds that, consistent with Bryant, the presiding Veterans Law Judge complied with the duties set forth in 38 C.F.R. 3.103(c)(2)  and that the Board may proceed to adjudicate the claim based on the current record.\n\nAs noted previously, the Board remanded the case for additional development in February 2014 and October 2014 in order to obtain updated VA treatment records and afford the Veteran a VA examination so as to determine the nature and etiology of his acquired psychiatric disorder.  As a result of such remands, updated VA treatment records were obtained and the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2015.  Therefore, the Board finds that the AOJ has substantially complied with the February 2014 and October 2014 remand directives such that no further action is necessary in this regard.  See D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 105 (2008); Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 146-47 (1999) (remand not required under Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998), where the Board's remand instructions were substantially complied with), aff'd, Dyment v. Principi, 287 F.3d 1377 (2002). \n\nThus, the Board finds that VA has fully satisfied the duty to assist.  In the circumstances of this case, additional efforts to assist or notify the Veteran in accordance with the VCAA would serve no useful purpose.  See Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) (strict adherence to requirements of the law does not dictate an unquestioning, blind adherence in the face of overwhelming evidence in support of the result in a particular case; such adherence would result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the appellant); Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (remands which would only result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the appellant are to be avoided).  VA has satisfied its duty to inform and assist the Veteran at every stage in this case, at least insofar as any errors committed were not harmful to the essential fairness of the proceeding.  Therefore, he will not be prejudiced as a result of the Board proceeding to the merits of his claim.\n\nII.  Analysis\n\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R.            § 3.303(a).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).\n\nDirect service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury. \nId.; also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) [(table)].\n\nThe requirement of a current disability is satisfied when the Veteran has a disability at the time he files his service connection claim or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  However, when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of the diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).\n\nWhere a Veteran served for at least 90 days during a period of war or after December 31, 1946, and manifests certain chronic diseases, including psychoses, to a degree of 10 percent within one year from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  According to 38 C.F.R. § 3.384 , the term \"psychosis\" includes a brief psychotic disorder; delusional disorder; psychotic disorder due to a medical condition; psychotic disorder, not otherwise specified (NOS); schizoaffective disorder; schizophrenia; schizophreniform disorder; shared psychotic disorder; and substance-induced psychotic disorder.\n\nAlternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  The use of continuity of symptoms to establish service connection is limited to those diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \n\nService connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).  If the evidence establishes that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(2). \n\nEffective July 13, 2010, if a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to that Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that a Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of that Veteran's service, a Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  \"[F]ear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a Veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the Veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3).\n\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).\n\nAt the outset, the Board points out that the preponderance of the probative evidence is against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD during the pendency of the claim and the record does not contain a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim.  See McClain, supra; Romanowsky, supra.  In this regard, October 2008 VA treatment records document \"PTSD-type symptoms\" and one clinician indicated the need to \"rule out PTSD\" as a diagnosis.  Thereafter, PTSD-like symptoms and a history of PTSD were noted during treatment in November 2008.  However, despite these notations, there is no indication in the record that the Veteran has ever been diagnosed with PTSD by a VA or private clinician, nor was he diagnosed with PTSD by the VA psychologist who conducted the March 2015 examination.\n\nConversely, review of the record reveals that the Veteran has been diagnosed with several acquired psychiatric disorders other than PTSD including:  unspecified depressive disorder, major depression, anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), personality disorder NOS, and substance abuse disorders, in sustained remission.  Thus, the first requirement for establishing service connection, a current disability, has been met.   \n\nThe Veteran's service treatment records reveal no treatment for or diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder, and his separation examination revealed no psychiatric abnormalities.  Moreover, there is no evidence the Veteran has ever been diagnosed with a psychosis.  However, in written documents and in his Board hearing testimony, the Veteran contends that his acquired psychiatric disorder is the result of witnessing a shipmate fall overboard while stationed on the USS Constellation CVA 64 in approximately March 1975.  While the AOJ attempted to verify such stressor, it was unsuccessful.  Thus, to establish service connection, there must be probative evidence linking his currently diagnosed psychiatric disorders with any instance of his military service.  Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim.\n\nIn this regard, in March 2015 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with his claim for service connection.  Following an interview with the Veteran, a review of the record, and a mental status examination, the examiner diagnosed an unspecified depressive disorder and substance abuse disorders, in sustained remission.  The examiner noted the Veteran's reports that he received mental health treatment in service, but noted (as does the Board) that there is no indication of such treatment in the Veteran's service treatment records.  The examiner also noted the Veteran's reports of being fearful in service and his unverified stressor of seeing a fellow sailor fall overboard.  Nevertheless, the examiner opined that the Veteran's depressive disorder was not related to his service and that his depressive symptoms are related to a \"long history of personality features and/or his substance abuse history.\"   \n\nThe Board finds that the opinion of the VA examiner provided after reviewing the claims file and examining the Veteran is highly probative as it reflects consideration of all relevant facts and the examiner provided a detailed rationale for the conclusion reached.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, supra (holding that it is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes to the probative value of a medical opinion); Stefl, supra.  There is no competent medical evidence to the contrary.\n\nTo the extent the Veteran believes that he suffers from a psychiatric disorder that is related to service, as a lay person, he has not shown that he has specialized training sufficient to render such an opinion.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting general competence to testify as to symptoms but not to provide medical diagnosis).  In this regard, the diagnosis and etiology of psychiatric disorders are matters not capable of lay observation, and require medical expertise to determine.  Accordingly, his opinion as to the diagnosis or etiology of the current psychiatric symptomology is not competent medical evidence.  The Board finds the opinion of the VA examiner to be significantly more probative than his lay assertions.\n\nMoreover, the Board recognizes that the Veteran reported at his March 2015 examination and elsewhere that he began abusing drugs during service and that the examiner attributed his current depressive symptoms to the Veteran's drug abuse history.  However, both 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.301(a) and 3.301(d) prohibit service connection for diseases incurred during active military service resulting from the abuse of drugs.  As any disease resulting from his abuse of illegal drugs is not considered to be in the line of duty pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(d), service connection for a depressive disorder as a result of illegal drug use in service cannot be established.  38 C.F.R. § 3.301(a).\n\nIn summary, the Board finds that the preponderance of the probative evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorders arose in service or are etiologically related to service or any incidents therein.  Additionally, there is no evidence that the Veteran was diagnosed with a psychosis within a year of his separation from service.  Accordingly, the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied. \n\nIn reaching the above conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, supra.   \n\n\nORDER\n\nService connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\nA.

psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and anxiety.\n\n\nREPRESENTATION\n\nVeteran represented by:\tVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States\n\n\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\n\nThe Veteran\n\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\n\nMary E. Rude, Associate Counsel\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran had verified active duty from December 1981 to May 1982.  She had additional duty with the Indiana Army National Guard/Army Reserve.  \n\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2008 rating decision of the Indianapolis, Indiana, Regional Office (RO).\n\nIn February 2009, the Veteran attended a Decision Review Officer (DRO) hearing at the RO, and in August 2010, the Veteran attended a Board hearing before the undersigned.  The transcripts of these hearings have been associated with the claims file.\n\nIn May 2011 and July 2014, the Board remanded the issue for additional evidentiary development.  It has now been returned to the Board for adjudication.\n\nThe claims file is now entirely in VA's secure electronic processing systems, Virtual VA and Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).\n\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\nThe preponderance of the competent evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran has a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, MDD, and anxiety, which is related to active service or any period of INACDUTRA or ACDUTRA.\n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nA chronic acquired psychiatric disorder was not incurred in or aggravated by active duty service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304 (2015).\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\n\nI.  Duties to Notify and Assist\n\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), in part, describes VA's duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2015).  VA is required to notify the claimant and his or her representative of any information, and any medical or lay evidence, not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(b); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).  \n\nVA has fulfilled the above requirements.  In a February 2008 VCAA notice letter, the Veteran was duly informed of the evidence needed to establish entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  The issue was last readjudicated in a June 2015 supplemental statement of the case.  Accordingly, no further development is required with respect to the duty to notify.\n\nNext, VA has a duty to assist a claimant in the development of a claim.  This duty includes assisting in the procurement of service treatment records and all relevant pre-and post-service treatment records, and by providing an examination, when necessary.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  \n\n\nIn May 2008, the RO issued a Formal Finding on the Unavailability of Records indicating that the Veteran's service treatment records were unavailable for review.  Although the memorandum did not properly list the steps taken to obtain these records, the record adequately indicates that a proper request was made for the Veteran's active service records, but no records were found.  Several of the Veteran's National Guard examinations are of record, and furthermore, the Veteran has asserted that her psychiatric problems began in 1985 or 1986, after the birth of her son, which is both after her National Guard service and several years after her active duty from December 1981 to May 1982.  The Board therefore finds that further attempts to obtain her active service records would be both futile and irrelevant to the questions currently at issue.  Furthermore, the Board does not dispute the Veteran's assertions that she requested maternity leave in 1985 while serving in the National Guard and that her request was refused by her superior officer; confirmation of these events through service records is therefore unnecessary.\n\nThis case was previously remanded in May 2011 and July 2014.  The Board finds that all prior remand instructions have been adequately completed.  A VA examination was held in May 2011, and the examination and opinion are adequate to decide the claim, as were based upon consideration of the Veteran's medical history, and they sufficiently inform the Board of the examiner's judgment and essential rationale.  See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 105-106 (2012).  Adequate attempts were made to obtain all private treatment records identified by the Veteran; unfortunately, responses from these providers indicated that no records were found or was destroyed, and the Veteran was adequately notified of this fact.  The Board finds that further attempts to acquire additional private records would therefore be futile.  Gagne v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 397, 403 (2015) (A search is futile \"where it is apparent that the sought-after records are either not in existence or not in the possession of the record's custodian.\").  The Board notes, however, that many of the records identified by the Veteran have been obtained through the Social Security Administration, and therefore have been available for review.  The Board therefore finds that there has been substantial compliance with the remand directives.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998); D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 104-05 (2008).\n\nIn addition to the documentary evidence, testimonial statements are of record, including testimony provided by the Veteran at a February 2009 RO hearing and at an August 2010 Board hearing.  At these hearings, the issue on appeal was clearly identified, the elements required to establish if service connection is warranted were explained, and suggestions were made regarding the submission of necessary favorable evidence.  The Veteran had an opportunity to present additional testimony on the essential elements necessary to prove the claim, and all hearing duties are found to be satisfied.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c) (2015); Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488, 492 (2010).\n\nIn sum, the Board finds that VA has complied with the VCAA's notification and assistance requirements, and any error in notice and development assistance cannot \"reasonably affect the outcome of the case,\" and hence will not affect \"the essential fairness of the [adjudication]\" for the service connection claim at issue.  See ATD Corp. v. Lydall, Inc., 159 F.3d 534, 549 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Mayfield v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 103 (2005).\n\nII.  Analysis\n\nThe Veteran asserts that service connection for chronic PTSD or other psychiatric disorder is warranted as she has been diagnosed with chronic PTSD secondary to several stressful events, which occurred during her periods of active duty and active duty for training with the Army National Guard.  In her November 2007 claim, the Veteran advanced that her PTSD was secondary to the premature birth of R., her son, during a period of advanced individual training.  In an April 2008 written statement, the Veteran related that she encountered the remains of a fellow servicewoman, who had committed suicide by jumping from a water tower, during her period of Army basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina.  \n\nAt a February 2009 DRO hearing, the Veteran testified that although she was having trouble with her pregnancy in 1985, her sergeant insisted that she continue to perform drills and would not let her go on maternity leave.  DRO Hearing Transcript 4-5.  She stated that she \"ended up giving birth at 24 weeks\" and her \"son ha[d] been an invalid ever since.\"  Id. at 4-5.  She then testified that her son was born in April 1985, and that her drills began in June 1985.  Id. at 6.  She also stated that one of the women in her unit had committed suicide.  Id. at 9.\n\nAt the Veteran's July 2010 Board hearing, the Veteran testified she had been harassed by her Army National Guard superiors when she requested maternity leave and subsequently experienced the premature birth and associated disability of her son.  Board Hearing Transcript 3-4.  She stated that she was told by her doctor that there was a possibility that her premature delivery \"could have stemmed from doing too much physical [training].\"  Id. at 5.\n\nGenerally, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred coincident with or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1131; \n38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection requires evidence satisfying three criteria:  (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (\"nexus\") between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  \nShedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\n\nActive military, naval, or air service includes any period of ACDUTRA during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated in line of duty, or any period of inactive duty training (INACDUTRA) during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from injury incurred in or aggravated in line of duty.  38 U.S.C.A. § 101(21), (24) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a), (d) (2015).  ACDUTRA includes full-time duty performed for training purposes by members of the National Guard of any state.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 101(22); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(c)(3).  Thus, service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred or aggravated while performing ACDUTRA, or from an injury incurred or aggravated while performing INACDUTRA.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 101(24), 106.\n\nThere are particular requirements for establishing PTSD in 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f), which are separate from the general requirements for establishing service connection in 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  See Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  Establishing service connection for PTSD requires (1) a diagnosis of PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a causal nexus between current symptomatology and the specific claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).  A mental health diagnosis should conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) (or, prior to 2014, the Fourth Edition [DSM-IV]).  38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (2015).\n\nWhat constitutes credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor occurred depends on the nature of the claimed stressor.  If the evidence establishes that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  VA has consistently defined \"engaged in combat with the enemy\" to require a veteran have participated in events constituting an actual fight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit or instrumentality.  See VAOPGCPREC 12-99 (October 18, 1999).  For stressors unrelated to combat, credible supporting evidence is necessary in order to grant service connection.  \"Credible supporting evidence\" of a noncombat stressor may be obtained from service records or other sources.  Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389 (1996).\n\nThis claim for service connection for PTSD is potentially subject to the revision to 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 effective July 13, 2010.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3).  That revision provides that, in certain circumstances, a veteran who has been diagnosed with PTSD by a VA or VA-contracted psychiatrist or psychologist based on a claimed stressor that is related to the veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor with lay testimony alone.  In this case, however, the Veteran has not argued to the Board that her stressors are based on fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, nor is there any evidence that the Veteran served in the vicinity or at the time of any military or terrorist activity.  This provision therefore does not apply in the current case.  \n\nThe Board has considered all of the evidence discussed above, but finds that entitlement to service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder is not warranted.  The weight of the competent and probative medical opinions of record is against finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD or any other chronic acquired psychiatric disorder which is related to her military service.\n\nApril 1981, May 1982, and February 1985 National Guard evaluations of the Veteran found her psychiatric status to be normal.\n\nThe Veteran's private treatment records show regular complaints related to depression.  In September 2002, the Veteran reported that her symptoms first began in 1986.  The Veteran attended counseling throughout 2003 and 2004, and the treatment records show reports of problems with her life stressors of caring for her disabled son and dealing with the death of her other son and her parents.  She reported having insomnia and feeling anxiety and depression.  She reported that she first started receiving psychiatric treatment in 1987.  In an April 2004 psychiatric assessment, the Veteran reported her difficulties related to the murder of her son, caring for her disabled son, and the death of her father.  She reported having decreased sleep due to thinking about the death of her son and crying daily.  The Veteran made no mention of problems related to service.  She was diagnosed with severe major depression.\n\nThe Veteran was evaluated by a private psychiatrist in January 2005.  She reported that she was discharged from the Army in 1986 due to her son's health problems.  She discussed the various stressors in her life, including finding her father dead, the murder of her son, her husband's attempted suicide, and the death of her son's nurse.  She was diagnosed with PTSD, major depression, and bereavement.  In her May 2004 Social Security Administration evaluation, the Veteran reported that a \"woman doctor\" gave her some a shot \"too soon when he was an infant,\" which caused his medical problems.  At a July 2004 Social Services evaluation, she reported that her son became ill when he had a bad reaction from a shot and that she had flashbacks of being raped at age 13.  She was diagnosed with depressive disorder.\n\nAt a November 2004 Social Services evaluation, the Veteran stated that she had PTSD due to \"[t]he murder of my son.  This is what's caused me to be in the situation I'm in.\"  At another point in the interview, the Veteran referenced having intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and flashbacks pertaining to being raped while an adolescent.  She stated that her son had an allergic reaction to a vaccination as a baby, and this left him debilitated.  She stated that her depression began due to that, and that she left the National Guard in 1986 due to her depression.  She later stated that she left the National Guard because her \"son was fighting for his life.\"  The Veteran discussed her stressors extensively, but did not mention any stressors caused by her service.  She was diagnosed with PTSD, major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder.\n\nApril 2006 letters from the Veteran's social worker and psychiatrist stated that the Veteran was diagnosed with major depression recurrent and PTSD.  An April 2006 disability evaluation noted that the Veteran had symptoms of depression, anxiety, and anhedonia caused by \"[n]umerous traumatic events resulting in loss of family members.\"  In May 2006, it was noted that the Veteran was discharged from the Army in 1986 due to her son's health problems.  Various life traumas were listed, including finding her father dead and the murder of her son.  She was diagnosed with PTSD, major depression, and bereavement.  Continued counseling in 2006 and 2007 show treatment for depression due to life stressors such as problems with her husband and caring for her son.  \n\n\nIn February 2011, the Veteran reported that her son was born early due to harassment from her sergeant in the National Guard.  At a May 2011 VA evaluation for treatment by a clinical nurse specialist, the Veteran reported being raped at age 12.  When asked about military sexual trauma, she reported that her superior \"told her to show up or she would be discharged,\" and that she threw off her rank and told him that she did not care.  She stated that she attributed her son's illness to being ordered by her military superior to come to work and complete her clerical duties.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with adjustment disorder with mixed anxious and depressed mood.  The examiner wrote that she could not state that the Veteran had experienced military sexual trauma, as she had \"clearly stated that her physician had refused to relieve her of any military duties, and that \"requesting a soldier who is subordinate in rank to complete their designated assignment is a duty and does not constitute sexual harassment-or in fact, any form of harassment.\"  She wrote that the Veteran's most significant stressor was providing total care for her grown son.  An addendum by a staff psychiatrist wrote that the Veteran had no history given of any conduct of a sexual nature or sexual assault, and no history of sexual harassment.\n\nThe Veteran attended a VA psychiatric examination in May 2011 with a clinical psychologist who performed an in-person examination of the Veteran and reviewed the claims file.  The Veteran reported that while she was pregnant, she was not dismissed from drills and as a result her son was born prematurely.  She stated that her superior snatched her collar and demoted her during the disagreement over her participation in physical training.  She also reported that she once \"saw white stuff\" on the ground which she later learned were the remains of a fellow service member who committed suicide.  She stated that she believed her son was born prematurely due to the stress she experienced in dealing with her sergeant and that this resulted in her PTSD.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with MDD and anxiety, and stated that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, as she did not have an adequate stressor and her reported symptoms of difficulty sleeping, social isolation, and inability to focus were due to her depression.  The examiner stated that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder was less likely as not a result of service, explaining that the Veteran had reported that her depression and anxiety symptoms were related to her dependent son's physical condition and her deceased son's murder.  The examiner wrote that the Veteran was also concerned about financial stressors and other current ongoing family issues, and summarized her findings by stating that \"[r]eview of available evidence indicate that the Veteran's symptoms are related to her dependent son's physical condition and her deceased son's murder.\"\n\nThe Veteran has also submitted treatment records for her son, R., which show that in 1986 and 1987 he was treated for encephalopathy of unclear origin precipitated by tonsillitis and a fever.  More recent treatment records show that the Veteran's son is nonverbal and has quadriparesis/spastic quadriplegia and seizures, requiring constant care.\n\nThe Board has carefully reviewed the medical records outlined above, but finds that the weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran's current psychiatric diagnoses had their onset during or are related to her military service. \n\nThe evidence of record does establish that the Veteran has a current psychiatric disability, which has been variously diagnosed as PTSD, MDD, anxiety disorder, and adjustment disorder.  She has thus met the current disability requirement.\n\nThe evidence does not show, however, that she incurred a psychiatric disorder during her active service, or that her current diagnosis is related to her active service.  The Veteran's active duty period of service is from December 1981 to May 1982.  The Veteran herself has not indicated that any traumatic event occurred to her at this time, or that her psychiatric problems had their onset at this time.  Rather, the Veteran asserts that her psychiatric disorder is related to negative experiences which occurred during her service in the National Guard.\n\nThe Board accepts that the Veteran had additional periods of INACDUTRA and ACDUTRA in the years following her separation from active duty in 1982, and that the events that she has described involving a disagreement with her superior officer over his refusal to grant her leave due to her pregnancy and the birth of her child occurred as she described, and that they likely occurred during a period of ACDUTRA.  See 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 101(24), 106.  Nevertheless, the overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that the Veteran's current psychiatric disorders are not related to any event that occurred during her military service, but are instead attributed to the numerous, severe personal stressors in her life post-service, including the murder of her son and caring for her disabled son R.\n\nThe Veteran is competent to testify regarding her experiences of having a conflict with her superior officer in service and of seeing the possible remains of a fellow service member who committed suicide.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (lay testimony is competent to describe observations, but must be weighed against the other evidence of record).  Lay witnesses are also competent to opine on some questions of etiology, and the Board must determine on a case-by-case basis whether a particular condition is the type of condition that is within the competence of a lay person.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 433, n. 4 (2011).  The question of whether the Veteran's current psychiatric disorder is related to her in-service experiences is testimony as to an internal psychiatric process, unlike the immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship of the type as to which the courts have found lay evidence to be competent.  Compare Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2009) (\"It is generally the province of medical professionals to diagnose or label a mental condition, not the claimant\") with Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376 (lay witness capable of diagnosing dislocated shoulder); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 403 (1995) (lay person competent to testify to pain and visible flatness of his feet).  Diagnosing a psychiatric disability is a complex medical matter; determining whether a person's symptoms are merely the type of feelings that accompany the stress and worry that would normally accompany such unfortunate events, or whether these symptoms rise to the severity and frequency that would warrant a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder requires psychiatric or psychological training.  The Veteran has not been shown to have the appropriate medical training and expertise to opine on this question, and her testimony in this regard is therefore not competent.\n\nAs to the medical evidence, the Board finds that it weighs against a nexus between any current psychiatric disability and service.  The Veteran's private treatment records show that she received counseling for problems related to caring for her disabled son, the death of her parents and other son, and sexual trauma in her adolescence.  Her April 2006 disability evaluation found that the Veteran's disorder was caused by the loss of her family members, and at her November 2004 Social Services evaluation, she reported many life stressors that led to her intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and flashbacks, but these did not include any event in service.  The Veteran's VA psychiatric evaluation found that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder was not a result of service, and that they were instead due to her dependent son's physical condition and her deceased son's murder.  As the examiner explained the reasons for his conclusions based on an accurate characterization of the evidence of record, this opinion is entitled to substantial probative weight.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  Furthermore, there are no conflicting medical opinions of record which contradict the findings of the VA examiner, and in fact her findings are fully consistent with the other medical evidence of record.\n\nWhile the Board sympathizes with the Veteran's contention that her son's disability was in some way caused by either stress from arguing with her superior officer or physical strain from serving on ACDUTRA while she was pregnant, the evidence of record does not support this contention.  The medical records of the Veteran's son R. do show that he has a serious disability which requires constant care, but treatment records from 1986 and 1987 show that he had encephalopathy of unclear origin precipitated by tonsillitis and a fever.  The Veteran herself seems unsure of the cause of her son's illness, as her statements made prior to filing the current claim show that she believed the illness was caused by an adverse reaction to a vaccination.  The credibility of a witness can be impeached by a showing of interest, bias, inconsistent statements, or, to a certain extent, bad character.  See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  Here, the Veteran's assertions are both inconsistent and lacking in probative value due to the Veteran's lack of medical training or expertise to allow her to form a medical judgment regarding the cause of her son's illness.  The Board finds no competent medical evidence linking the Veteran's son's illness to her military service, and no indication that the Veteran's post-service life stressors, which have clearly been shown to be the cause of her current psychiatric disorder, are related to her service in any way.\n\nThe Board also acknowledges that there are special provisions pertaining to corroboration of PTSD based on personal assault in service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5).  The Veteran has indicated that she believes her harassment in service should constitute \"sexual harassment.\"  The Veteran's assertions are accepted at face value regarding being denied leave from service for her pregnancy and/or following the birth of her child, but such conduct does not constitute sexual harassment or military sexual trauma, and as such, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) are not applicable in this case.  This is manifestly evident to the Board based on the Veteran's own testimony, and is further indicated by the Veteran's May 2011 VA intake evaluation, at which the examiner found that the Veteran had clearly stated that her complaint was that she was not relieved from duty when she felt she should be, and this \"does not constitute sexus harassment-or in fact, any form of harassment.\"\n\nFinally, the Board notes that at no time has the Veteran been shown to have a diagnosis of psychosis, and thus consideration of whether the presumptions afforded for a chronic disease is not warranted at this time, nor are such presumptions applicable to periods of INACDUTRA and ACDUTRA.  See 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309 (2015); Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 46-47 (2010).\n\nIn sum, the weight of the competent and probative evidence of record therefore fails to establish that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder had its onset during active duty service or any period of INACDUTRA or ACDUTRA, nor is it related to any event during service.  The preponderance of the evidence is thus against the claim for entitlement to service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, MDD, and anxiety.  In reaching the conclusion above the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.\n\n\nORDER\n\nEntitlement to service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, MDD, and anxiety, is denied.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\nK.

Orleans, Louisiana\n\n\nTHE ISSUE\n\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n\nREPRESENTATION\n\nAppellant represented by:\tParalyzed Veterans of America, Inc.\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\n\nJ. Acosta, Associate Counsel\n\n\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\n\nAppellant\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran served on active duty from August 1967 to August 1969.  She also had subsequent service in the United States Marine Corp Reserves.\n\nThis matter initially came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2004 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in New Orleans, Louisiana, which denied service connection for PTSD.  In Clemmons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) the Court held that, when the Veteran specifically requests service connection for PTSD, but the medical record includes other psychiatric diagnoses, the claim may not be narrowly construed as only a PTSD claim.  In light of this holding, and the fact that the Veteran has been diagnosed with psychiatric disorders other than PTSD, the issue has been recharacterized, as stated on the title page.\n\nIn March 2008, the Veteran testified at a personal hearing over which the undersigned Acting Veterans Law Judge presided in Washington D.C.  A transcript of the hearing has been associated with the Veteran's claims file.  The Board Remanded the appeal in February 2009, August 2011, and August 2013.\n\nThe Veteran's claims file is now wholly electronic.  \n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n1.  No acquired chronic psychiatric disability was present until many years following the Veteran's 1969 discharge from active service, or until about 10 years after her separation from reserve service.\n\n2.  The preponderance of the evidence is against a finding that a current acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is etiologically related to the Veteran's active or reserve service.\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nThe criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, are not met, nor may service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder, to include a psychosis, be presumed.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 101(24), 1101, 1110, 1131 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, 3.04, 3.307, 3.309 (2015).\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\n\nService connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Evidence of continuity of symptomatology from the time of service until the present is required where the chronicity of a condition manifested during service either has not been established or might reasonably be questioned.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  \n\nSome chronic diseases are presumed to have been incurred in service, although not otherwise established as such, if manifested to a degree of ten percent or more within one year of the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a) (listing applicable chronic diseases, including psychoses).  Proof of service incurrence through continuity of symptomatology is restricted to chronic diseases defined as such by VA regulation.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).\n\nRegulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).\n\nThe term \"active service\" also includes ACDUTRA during which the individual concerned was disabled from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty, or INACDUTRA during which the individual concerned was disabled from an injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty.  38 U.S.C.A. § 101(24); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(d), 3.6(a).  \"Active service\" may also be established by circumstances not alleged in this case, such as myocardial infarction.  Id.  A stressor which results in PTSD, or other acquired psychiatric disorder, constitutes an injury as defined for VA compensation purposes.  VAOPGCPREC 08-2001 (February 26, 2001).\n\nTo establish service connection for an injury, the Court generally requires a Veteran to show (1) medical evidence of a current disability, (2) medical or lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury, and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service injury and the present disability.  Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 36 (2007).  \n\nIn order to establish service connection for PTSD, governing law requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV, when this claim was initially submitted, or DSM-V under current regulations); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).  \n\nThe record does not show that the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy, nor does she so contend.  Since the Veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy, the Veteran's lay testimony, by itself, is not sufficient to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  Instead, the record must contain credible supporting evidence that corroborates the Veteran's testimony or statements.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f); Stone v. Nicholson, 480 F.3d 1111 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \n\nCorroboration of every detail of a claimed stressor, including the appellant's personal participation, is not required.  Instead, a Veteran only needs to offer independent evidence of a stressful event that is sufficient to imply his or her personal exposure.  Pentecost v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 124, 128 (2002) (quoting Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997)).\n\nIf a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the Veteran's service records may corroborate the Veteran's account of the stressor incident.  Examples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  Examples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include, but are not limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes.  \n\nThe Veteran was advised that evidence from sources other than service records could constitute credible supporting evidence of a stressor.  An appropriate medical or mental health professional was asked for an opinion as to whether the personal assault stressor was incurred during service, based on all evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5).  \n\nWhile the appeal was in development, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) recognized the widely-held view that the absence of an entry in a record may which would ordinarily be recorded gives rise to a legitimate negative inference that the event did not occur; Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 440 (2011) (Lance, J., concurring) (citing the Federal Rules of Evidence for the proposition that \"the absence of an entry in a record may be evidence against the existence of a fact if such a fact would ordinarily be recorded\").\n\nThe final requirement of 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) is medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service stressor and the current disability.  After-the-fact medical nexus evidence cannot be the sole evidence of the occurrence of the claimed stressor.  Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 396.  That is, the fact that a physician or other health professional accepted a Veteran's description of military experiences as credible and diagnosed him/her as suffering from PTSD does not mean the [Board is] required to grant service connection for PTSD.  Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614, 618 (1992). \nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b); see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  \n\nThe Board has reviewed all the evidence in the claims file.  There is no requirement that each item of evidence submitted by the appellant be discussed.  Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000).\n\nFacts and analysis\n\nMore than 300 pages of Service Personnel Records and Service Dental Records have been associated with the electronic claims files.  Unfortunately, many pages of the records obtained are illegible, through no fault of the Veteran.  Many of the records show that the image obtained was the \"best image\" available even where the image remains illegible.  The Veteran's service treatment records have been determined to be unavailable, through no fault of the Veteran's, despite numerous attempts to obtain such records over a period of more than 10 years.  Some service personnel records from her tour of active duty and from her reserve service are of record and are legible.  \n\nThe personnel records available from the Veteran's period of active service reflect that she was not charged with any offense, received no judicial punishments, and there is no record of any adverse report.  There is also no evidence of psychiatric, mental health, or family counseling.  Further, there are no records that she was listed in commanding officer logs or sick logs.  \n\nThe Veteran's performance data from August 1969 reflects that she was rated as above average or excellent for all observed categories, with one category, loyalty, evaluated as outstanding.  The handwritten portion of the evaluation notes that the Veteran readily accepted added responsibility and needed little or no supervision.  She was noted to be neat, well-groomed, and always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need of help.  These entries do not substantiate the claim, since the records include no reference to a stressor, and do not disclose changes of any type that might follow such a stressor.  \n\nIn 1979, the Veteran sought service connection for denervation and radiculopathy of L5-S1 and C-5.  Private medical records reflect only that she was treated for a back disability and a nerve disability affecting one hand.  The Veteran was hospitalized at the New Orleans VA Medical Center in May 1979.  No claim for service connection was granted.  The evidence available related to her 1979 hospitalization and claim is, unfortunately, incomplete; only minimal records of the VA inpatient admission could be obtained.  However, the fact that the Veteran did not seek service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, and the lack of notation of any diagnosis or treatment of an acquired psychiatric disorder, is unfavorable to the claim.  The 1979 evidence is especially unfavorable to a finding that the Veteran manifested symptoms of an acquired psychiatric disability chronically following her service separation.\n\nA June 1983 performance report, from her reserve service, noted that the Veteran had initiative and a take-charge attitude.  She consistently displayed altruism.  She had begun to take initiative in her job and in handling other Marines.  She took advantage of every opportunity to better herself as a professional Marine.  The rater stated that the Veteran's untiring efforts and sincere desire to succeed made her a valuable asset as a Marine Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO).  \n\nAn April 1985 performance evaluation notes that the Veteran was developing into an excellent to outstanding NCO.  She accepted assignments with enthusiasm.  She was noted to be qualified for promotion to the next higher grade.  Another April 1985 performance evaluation report notes that the Veteran was a dedicated, conscientious Marine who was then enrolled in and almost finished with the Staff NCO Academy Career Nonresident program.  She was tactful and worked well with others.  She had the respect of superiors and subordinates.  The remarks suggested that she could be more forceful and that she sometimes lacked self-confidence, but it was felt that as her knowledge grew, so would her confidence.  \n\nReports from December 1985 note that the Veteran was a \"squared away woman Marine.\"  She was willing to take on any assigned task and learn new things.  An August 1986 performance evaluation noted that the Veteran was loyal, dedicated, conscientious, and diligent.  She did not hesitate to work the hours necessary to accomplish her tasks.  She was noted to have worked well with the new personnel and performed her tasks in an efficient manner.  She set up the postal bins between the different units at ADT and saw that they were efficiently run.  \n\nAn August 1988 performance evaluation report notes that the Veteran recently joined the command.  She was noted to be quiet and reserved; she needed some supervision and needed more than a normal amount of time to complete forms/typing with which she was unfamiliar, but she was cooperative and eager to learn.   \n\nA July 1989 performance evaluation notes that the Veteran was hard working, dedicated, and conscientious, accepted responsibility, performed accurately, and required little supervision.  She was noted to be steadily increasing in knowledge.  She was also noted to be eager to learn more.  The performance evaluation specified that she had good rapport with the enlisted servicemembers and officers.  She was described as mature, dependable and reliable.  \n\nReserve service after April 1990 is not shown in the available records, and no record that the Veteran was paid for service after April 1990 was located by DFAS.  \n\nThe Veteran's performance, as shown by the performance evaluations from 1983 to 1989, establishes that the Veteran did not manifest deterioration in work performance, episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety affecting her work performance, or unexplained economic or social behavior changes.  The reserve service personnel records are persuasive evidence that the Veteran did not manifest impairment due to an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, during the first 20 years following her 1969 separation from active service.  \n\nLittle is known about the Veteran's medical care or occupational functioning from 1990 through 2000.  In September 2000, the Veteran sought VA evaluation for complaints of chest pain; she provided a history of treatment for lupus, among other disorders.  She reported having seen a psychiatrist when she was \"injured on the job.\"  The Veteran was seen for psychiatry triage as well as for chest pain.  The corresponding note indicates that the Veteran was a new patient, and was \"requesting PTSD.\"  \n\nShe complained of not liking closed in places, feelings of being anxious, afraid of heights, difficulty sleeping and flashbacks.  The Veteran reported that she had no combat history but she did see and count bodies.  She indicated that the count was always different from the number reported in the media.  She saw faces of different people she befriended.  She heard voices that said \"Help me!\" or \"Come near!\"  She reported that spirits of people, snakes, and mad dogs were after her.  The impression was major depressive episode, recurrent, with psychotic features and PTSD, mild.  \n\nShe reported that she had worked regularly for the past 24 years as a support person in a plant.  She was no longer able to drive.  She said that she was evaluated by a \"whole lot of different doctors\" in the 1980s when she injured her back at work.  She thought she saw a psychiatrist who also did some family counseling back then.  She was put on some sort of prescription medication that made her dislike the way she felt and therefore she discontinued it.  The Veteran reported a stressor during her reserve service; to that extent, the September 2000 treatment notes are favorable to the claim.  \n\nAn October 2000 VA mental health clinic group intake note indicated no improvement in auditory hallucinations after taking medications.  The diagnosis was major depression with psychotic features.  An Addendum to the note reflects that the Veteran reported that, while on active duty, she assisted in picking up body parts of 13 Marines who died in a chopper crash.  The VA provider suggested that this incident may have had some temporal and causative effects on her psychological problems.  To the extent that the provider suggested that a stressor during reserve service might be linked to a current psychiatric disorder, these treatment notes are favorable to the claim.  However, in the absence of objective evidence corroborating this stressor, the medical opinion based on the uncorroborated stressor is of little probative value.\n\nA December 2000 VA mental health clinic note indicates that the Veteran had continued depressive symptoms, with marked isolation and reduced interest in past friends or hobbies.  She related having nightmares with increasing frequency.  The nightmares focus on her being ordered around and victimized.  \n\nA March 2001 mental health psychiatry note indicates that the Veteran's mood and affect continue to slowly brighten.  She still had occasional auditory hallucinations and intrusive thoughts of picking up body parts of friends following a helicopter crash in California.  \n\nIn March 2002, the Veteran was hospitalized for severe depression and psychotic features.  She reported having auditory hallucinations but was unable to figure out what they were saying.  She described having command auditory hallucinations and visual hallucinations regarding people she knew in the Vietnam War.  \n\nA March 2002 VA psychiatry note indicates that the Veteran described seeing people from the war, friends she knew, soldiers to whom she delivered mail.  She discussed nightmares of a woman's finger being severed in service.  To the extent that the Veteran reported a stressor during her reserve service, these treatment notes are favorable to the claim.  \n\nAn April 2002 Social Security Administration (SSA) record indicates that, after an honorable discharge from the military she worked at Lockheed Martin processing tools, parts, and blueprints for 25 years, until August 12, 2001.  The examiner noted the Veteran's account of some problems with nervousness and depression, and her hospitalization in March 2002.  Since this evidence establishes that the Veteran was able to work for the same employer for 25 following her separation from active service, this evidence is unfavorable to a finding that the Veteran manifested behavioral changes following any incident of active or reserve service.    \n\nAn August 2002 VA PTSD outpatient treatment note indicates that the Veteran reported having ongoing dreams about sexual trauma that occurred in the military.  \n\nA September 2002, the Veteran complained of chronic depression and PTSD.  The Veteran reported having had an abusive childhood.  She was physically abused by her father and mother.  Her father fondled her after the death of her mother.  She stated that this was a lone incident and denied any other unwanted childhood sexual experiences.  The Veteran reported experiencing sexual trauma in the military.  Specifically, she reported being raped by three other women.  She reported that she reported this incident to her commanding officer but no action was taken.  \n\nShe indicated that boot camp was \"fine.\"  She stated that she was named \"outstanding recruit of the platoon\" and that she received her first rank out of boot camp.  The Veteran reported psychiatric problems since her military discharge.  The examiner opined that the Veteran met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD due to sexual assault that she suffered while on active duty.  The Veteran reported audiovisual hallucinations of her rapists and other Marines.  She reacted with intense fear and helplessness.  She had nightmares about the rape, reported dissociative states in which she feels as if she is reliving her rape and defending herself.  This evidence is favorable to, but not dispositive of, the claim.  \n\nA September 2002 VA mental health note reflects she had a tenuous living situation.  She was unable to pay her rent, utilities, and food.  She was noted to be in treatment at the Women's Program for PTSD.  The impression was depressive disorder, history of psychosis, stable, inadequate housing and history of PTSD, currently being treated.  An October 2002 outpatient report was consistent with the September 2002 report.  \n\nAt VA psychiatric examination in November 2002, the Veteran reported that in May 1969 she was on guard duty in the family barracks at Camp Pendleton when three females attacked her and performed sexual acts.  She called for help, but no one came.  She wrote a note in the company logbook indicating that an incident had occurred, but she did not give any details.  She also reported the incident to her commanding officer and provided the names of the individuals involved.  She was not referred to a hospital and did not seek psychiatric help.  \n\nShe also recounted a helicopter crash at Camp Pendleton, during her reserve service, in which one of her roommates was killed.  She recalled finding a finger lying near the crash site.  Eight Marines were killed.  \n\nThe examiner assigned a diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features.  The examiner noted that, despite the history of mixed depressive and psychotic symptoms dating back 10 to 15 years, the Veteran had held a job successfully until approximately two years earlier.  The criteria for diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder was not met, the examiner concluded, because it was not clear that she ever had a distinct period of two weeks when the psychotic symptoms persisted but she was free of mood symptoms.  The examiner opined, in essence, that no current psychiatric disorder was linked to the Veteran's service or any incident thereof.  The opinion is well reasoned and provides an accurate summary of the record.  The opinion is persuasive evidence against the claim.  \n\nA January 2003 VA PTSD outpatient report noted that the Veteran discussed several motor vehicle accidents in which she was involved.  She reported an incident in the military in which she fell from a vehicle and slid 50 feet into an intersection.  She stated that anxiety attacks were a barrier to driving.  This treatment note provides a description of a stressor not previously reported.  \n\nHowever, the Veteran has not provided additional information as to the possible date or location of a motor vehicle accident referenced in the January 2003 treatment notes.  She has not indicated when or where she was treated for injuries sustained in such a motor vehicle accident in the 10 years since she mentioned such a stressor.  The Veteran has not provided any additional details which could be used to verify the motor vehicle accident.  Thus, the treatment note is unfavorable to the claim, since it is not consistent with any prior information and is not clarified or further described in any later stressor account.  \n\nSSA awarded the Veteran disability benefits in a favorable 2003 decision.  The award letter provides no discussion of a specific stressor or a link between the Veteran's service and an acquired psychiatric disability.  This award, and the underlying medical evidence, provides no additional information that is favorable or unfavorable to the claim.\n\nAn April 2003 VA outpatient note indicates that the award of SSA disability benefits reminded the Veteran of past hardships including being raped, homeless, unemployed, and depressed.  This event led to a resurgence of memories associated with the rape, including the name of one of her attackers, T., as well as a woman who later helped protect her from the rapists, E.  The social worker who authored the note indicated that memories of her rape appeared to have been the core of the Veteran's current dysphoria.  \n\nThis treatment note raises additional inconsistencies in the information provided by the Veteran.  Although the Veteran told the provider she remembered names of two servicemembers involved in the incident, the Veteran has never provided any name of a fellow former servicemember for purposes of development of her claim for compensation.  Her statements at the April 2003 VA treatment visit are inconsistent with her actions since that time.  That inconsistency undermines her credibility.\n\nThe Board has considered all the evidence of record regarding an alleged sexual assault that the Veteran reports occurred during her active service.  The fact that no service department records of the incident have been located does not weigh against the possible occurrence or the Veteran's credibility, since VA regulations recognize that such incidents, if reported, were not uniformly documented.  However, in the October 2003 stressor statement, the Veteran stated that she could not remember the names of any individuals involved.  That report is in conflict with the April 2003 treatment report.  \n\nThe Veteran contends that she had symptoms of a psychiatric disability soon after her discharge from active duty and soon after reserve service was completed.  The Veteran is competent to report events during active service.  However, once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994) (distinguishing between competency (\"a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered\") and credibility (\"a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted\").  The evidence of record contradicts the Veteran's assertion of chronic psychiatric symptoms or disability or symptoms or disability due to psychosis during a presumptive period.  \n\nIn weighing credibility, VA may consider interest, bias, inconsistent statements, bad character, internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, self-interest, consistency with other evidence of record, malingering, desire for monetary gain, and demeanor of the witness.  Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  The Board may weigh the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence against the lay evidence in determining credibility, but the Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  \n\nThe Board may not ignore a veteran's testimony simply because he or she is an interested party and stands to gain monetary benefits; personal interest may, however, affect the credibility of the evidence.  Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991).  The Veteran provided varying accounts of stressor events to VA adjudicators and treatment providers during the lengthy pendency of the appeal.   Given the inconsistencies between the Veteran's reports and the objective evidence of record, the Veteran's credibility is diminished.    \n\nThe Veteran's service personnel records are associated with the claims file.  Review of the service personnel records shows no indication of disciplinary actions, adverse personnel actions, drop in performance, or requests for reassignment.  During active service she states that she was awarded the outstanding recruit award, her August 1969 performance evaluation was excellent.  \n\nThe Veteran reported, at the November 2002 VA examination, that she enjoyed both active service and reserve service.  The Veteran reported that she chose to be discharged from active service in August 1969 due in part to the sexual abuse, but her performance obviously did not deteriorate in any way due to the alleged assault.  Importantly, in August 1969, just three months after the alleged sexual assault occurred in May 1969, the Veteran received an excellent performance review.\n\nThe Veteran enlisted in 1983 for six additional years of reserve service and was promoted.  Her reserve component service performance record was also excellent and unblemished.  It reflects only high achievement and excellent work ethic.  Significantly, VA outpatient treatment records from 2000 and 2001 do not contain any allegation of any kind of military sexual trauma or abuse.  The first evidence of a report of military sexual trauma is from August 2002, after the Veteran filed her claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  Notably, prior to August 2002, the Veteran specifically alleged other stressors, to include the helicopter crash, seeing dead bodies, and generalized nightmares about people she knew who may have died serving in Vietnam.  This is not necessarily significant in and of itself, yet, combined with the other credibility evidence of record; the Board finds that it diminishes her credibility somewhat in that her descriptions regarding her stressors have changed at various examinations.\n\nThe Veteran was referred to the VA Mental Health Clinic in September 2002 following a positive military sexual trauma and PTSD screening.  It was at that time she was diagnosed with PTSD due to the military sexual trauma.  In contrast, the VA psychiatrist who conducted November 2002 VA examination, two months later, concluded that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  The Board also points out that the examiner had access to and reviewed the Veteran's claims file, to include her prior psychiatric diagnoses, hallucinations, and alleged stressors.  As noted above, the November 2012 VA examination report is lengthy, accurate, and provides the reasoning for the examiner's conclusions.  In contrast, the VA psychologist who provided the September 2002 diagnosis did not reference review of any records, but, rather, assigned a diagnosis based upon the Veteran's account of her own history.\n\nAlso probative regarding the Veteran's credibility is the fact that she has told different examiners different facts regarding her history.  At the November 2002 VA exam, she stated that in 1987 approximately she started feeling depressed.  At the September 2002 PTSD examination, she stated that she has been having mental health issues ever since service.  \n\nThe various psychiatrists and psychologists who have noted PTSD as due to military sexual trauma appear to have done so based only on the Veteran's self-reported history, rather than review of the complete record.  A medical professional's opinion based on a post-service examination of a veteran is not competent evidence that an in-service stressor occurred.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 145 (1997); Moreau, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395-96.\n\nTo the degree that the medical providers have based their opinions on the Veteran's self-reported accounts of military sexual trauma, the Board has found such reports to be not credible, and it follows that medical opinions based on such reports are not probative.  Further, because such medical opinions are not based on review of the evidence they do not constitute verification of military sexual trauma under 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(4).\n\nAs a layperson, the Veteran can certainly provide an account of her symptoms and feelings at any given time.  However, service personnel records, and later reserve service records in particular, weigh heavily against the Veteran's September 2002 account that she has had mental health problems ever since her active service.  As mentioned previously, the stellar performance evaluation reports during her reserve service generally negate the contention that mental health problems, such as psychosis, were present at that time.  \n\nIn addition, the Veteran has claimed that her PTSD is a result of a stressor involving her witnessing and picking up human remains of Marines who had been killed in a helicopter crash in Camp Pendleton.  This stressor is a major event, yet remains unverified after all attempts.  \n\nWhile the case was on remand status following the 2009 Remand from the Board, the RO was instructed to accomplish all development action in order to corroborate the stressor.  The RO acquired a Command Chronology from the Commanding General, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California from July 1968 through December 1968; no helicopter crash was reported.  \n\nThe Veteran then provided statements indicating that, during her reserve service, in 1990, she performed post-crash duties at the site of a helicopter crash in which two female Marines were \"torn to pieces.\"  No objective confirmation of this stressor has been located.  It is not credible that a helicopter crash in 1990 which resulted in fatalities would not have been documented by the service department or the base at which it is alleged to have occurred, or that no other information, such as a newspaper article, reports of aviation accidents, or the like, would be located.  \n\nThe Board finds it very probative that the Veteran has described vividly remembering witnessing a crash involving either 2 (October 2004 VA outpatient records), 8 (November 2002 VA examination), or 13 (October 2000 VA Mental Health Clinic outpatient records, Addendum) dead Marines, to include her roommates, yet there is no objective confirmation of the event.  In particular, the Board notes the Veteran's statements that \"the media\" reported on this crash, but their reports were inaccurate.  \n\nIf the alleged incident had been reported in \"the media,\" as the Veteran has described, it would be expected that objective information about the incident could be located on the Internet, if not from the service department.  See, e.g., Bureau of Aircraft Accident Archives, http://www.baaa-acro.com/ (archive of information about aviation accidents, listing more than 23,300 events); Los Angeles Times, Collections, \"Helicopter Accidents Marine Corps, US,\" http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/helicopter-accidents-marine-corps-u-s.  The absence of any objective corroboration of the alleged helicopter crash with fatalities is highly unfavorable to the Veteran's contention that she picked up human remains following such an accident.  \n\nThe Veteran is a sympathetic claimant.  The record establishes that the Veteran performed her active service honorably and well, and was highly regarded during her reserve component service.  The pursuit of this claim for the 15 years of the pendency of this appeal establishes that the Veteran sincerely believes that a current psychiatric disorder is linked to her service.\n\nNevertheless, the preponderance of the evidence is unfavorable to the claim.  The available service personnel records, although incomplete, show no indictors of a stressor, such as disciplinary problems or behavioral changes.  The lay and medical records are inconsistent with the Veteran's assertion that she had chronic mental health disability symptoms following her active or reserve service.  \n\nThe AMC issued a March 2011 memorandum summary of actions taken in attempt to corroborate the Veteran's alleged PTSD stressors.  It was concluded that exhaustive attempts failed to corroborate a stressor and no further development should be conducted.  Although the Veteran suggests that it is possible that this crash may have occurred shortly after the Veteran was called up on reserve duty after Desert Storm began in 1991, there simply is no record of 2, 8, or 13 Marines perishing in a helicopter accident at Camp Pendleton at that time either.  See http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Chronologies/Yearly/1991.htm and http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Chronologies/Yearly/1992.htm.\n\nWith regard to psychiatric disorders other than PTSD, the Veteran is diagnosed with depressive disorder with psychotic features and has been receiving SSA disability benefits for severe major depression since August 12, 2001.  However, there is no indication in the record whatsoever that depressive disorder with psychotic features is related to her service.\n\nIn sum, the Board is not authorized to grant service connection for PTSD, because the Veteran has not presented verified or verifiable stressors.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304.  The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD are not met because there is no medical evidence or opinion that such disorder began during service, is etiologically related to service or any incident thereof, or that the Veteran manifested a psychosis within one year after her discharge from service.  \n\nBecause the evidence preponderates against the claim the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54.  The claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, must be denied.  \n\nDuties to Notify and Assist\n\nVA must inform the claimant of any information and evidence not of record (1) that is necessary to substantiate the claim; (2) that VA will seek to provide; and (3) that the claimant is expected to provide.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5103(a); C.F.R. § 3.159(b)(1); Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), 38 C.F.R §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).  Pelegrini v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 112 (2004).\n\nIn this case, an initial letter advising the Veteran of the requirements for establishing service connection for PTSD was issued in February 2001.  That letter included a PTSD questionnaire, in compliance with special development requirements when a PTSD claim is based on a stressor of an alleged physical or sexual assault.  See YR v. West, 11 Vet. App. 393, 399 (1998); Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272 (1999); M21-1, Part III, para.5.14d; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3).  \n\nThe Board notes that letters dated in February 2001, October 2003, December 2003, March 2004, May 2004, September 2004, October 2004, November 2004, August 2006, March 2009, February 2011, and December 2013 provided additional and updated information to the Veteran.  The March 2009 letter from the AOJ, for example, followed the February 2009 Remand in which the Board advised the Veteran of the elements required to establish service connection for PTSD and the types of evidence that tend to substantiate claims of physical or sexual assault in service.  \n\nThe Veteran initially submitted this claim for service connection in 2001, nearly 15 years ago.  Numerous communications have been provided to the Veteran during the pendency of the claim.  Neither the Veteran nor her representative has alleged prejudice with respect to either content or timing of notice.  See Shinseki v. Sanders, 129 S. Ct. 1696 (2009).  If there was any deficiency in the timing of complete initial notice, such deficiency has been remedied by the fact that the Veteran's claim was readjudicated in 2011 and in 2013, after proper VCAA notice was provided and after the Veteran had an opportunity to respond.  Mayfield v. Nicholson, 444 F.3d 1328 (2006).  The Board finds that the duty to notify the Veteran has been met.  \n\nThe record also reflects that VA has made reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records adequately identified by the Veteran.  Specifically, the information and evidence that have been associated with the claims file include some of the Veteran's service personnel records, VA treatment records, VA examination reports, and records associated with an SSA disability determination.  Also of record and considered in connection with the appeal are various written statements submitted by the Veteran and her representative.\n\nIn cases such as this, where a veteran's service records are unavailable through no fault of the claimant, or as here, where records available are rendered partially illegible in the electronic format, there is a heightened obligation to assist the claimant in the development of the case and a heightened obligation to carefully consider the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  See O'Hare v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 365 (1991).  The Board finds that the substantial stressor development action taken by the AMC outlined in the March 2011 and August 2014 memoranda reflect that VA has met the heightened obligation to assist.\n\nThe Veteran vaguely but repeatedly has indicated that she sought some sort of counseling or mental health treatment in the 1980s but she is unsure why.  She indicated that she was treated at a facility identified as Touro; however, attempts to retrieve those records resulted in a negative reply, as the facility did not retain records for more than 10 years. \n\nThe service department was queried to determine whether records which might be relevant to a sexual assault at a barracks might be available.  In March 2011, a memorandum from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) was sent to VA indicating that there was no record of any investigation involving a sexual assault in which the Veteran was a victim.  \n\nAdditionally, a February 1969 Command Chronology from Camp Pendleton for July through December 1968 was received and it showed no helicopter crash during that time period.  In March 2011, the Appeals Management Center (AMC) issued a memorandum formally finding the Veteran had not presented verifiable in-service stressor information that could be submitted to the U.S. Army Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) for corroboration.  It was found that no further action should take place with regard to stressor verification.  \n\nThe Board, in an August 2013 Remand, again directed the AOJ to seek to verify the Veteran's alleged stressor, with the updated information provided by the Veteran and the DFAS pay status information.  A very specific request to the Naval Safety Center requested a search for records of a helicopter crash at Fort Pendleton on the dates when the Veteran had paid service (January 6, 7, 15, 1990; February 10, 11, 12 - 25,-1990; and March 6, 21, 1990).  The Naval Safety Center found no records of a helicopter crash at Fort Pendleton on those dates.  \n\nIn August 2014, the AOJ's JSSRC coordinator summarized the attempts to locate records to assist the Veteran.  Without additional information from the Veteran, any further attempts to locate information to corroborate the two described stressors would be fruitless.  There is no indication that the Veteran would be able to provide additional information on Remand that has not been provided during the 15 years of the pendency of this appeal.  A further Remand or further attempt to develop the claim would be fruitless, and is not required.  \n\nAs discussed above, the Veteran was notified and aware of the evidence needed to substantiate her claim, the avenues through which she might obtain such evidence and the allocation of responsibilities between herself and VA in obtaining such evidence.  The Veteran was an active participant in the claims process, identifying pertinet medical evidence and submitting evidence.  Thus she has been provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate in the claims process and has done so.  Any error in the sequence of events or content of the notice is not shown to have any effect on the case or to cause injury to the Veteran.  Therefore, any such error is harmless and does not prohibit consideration of this matter on the merits.  Dingess/Hartman v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006); See also ATD Corp. V. Lydall, Inc., 159 F. 3d 534, 549 (Fed. Cir. 1998).\n\nA remand by the Board confers on the claimant, as a matter of law, the right to compliance with remand orders.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).  In this regard, the Board is satisfied as to the compliance with the instruction for its February 2009, August 2011, and August 2013 remands. \n\nSpecifically, the February 2009 Board remand instructed the RO to obtain any SSA decision and any medical treatment records associated with such a decision.  That information is associated with the file.  The RO was also requested to send the Veteran a letter informing her of the information and evidence required to substantiate her claim for service connection for PTSD in cases alleging PTSD due to personal assault.  That letter was send.  \n\nIn addition, the RO was instructed to afford the Veteran an opportunity to provide more information regarding her stressor, to include names of the alleged assailants, the commanding officer to whom she reported the claimed stressor, and the date, within two months, during which the alleged sexual assault incident occurred.  She was also to be afforded the opportunity to identify each facility at which she received psychiatric care post-service, and another search for her service treatment records was to be conducted.  \n\nThe RO was instructed to request any outstanding information or records.  The RO requested copies of the Veteran's service treatment records through the VA Records Management Center, the Marine Corps Reserve Support Command, and the National Personnel Records Management Center.  The records were determined to be unavailable through any and all sources.  \n\nThe Veteran authorized release of private medical information.  Those records were sought but a negative response was received, indicating that such records were destroyed after 10 years.  \n\nThe RO was directed to request records from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) for evidence of the Veteran's earned pay or leave from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1992.  The RO was further instructed to request Camp Pendleton to search pertinent records for a helicopter crash which corresponded to the Veteran's reserve service dates as verified by DFAS.  \n\nIn August 2013, DFAS provided the exact dates that the Veteran was in pay status from January 1, 1990 to December 21, 1992.  This information was then shared with the Military Police Office at Camp Pendleton.  The Military Police Office requested names and social security numbers of the casualties with an exact date.  The appellant responded that she was unable to provide names of the victims of the alleged helicopter crash.  The Board found that a search should be conducted to find any relevant records from the alleged time period which might corroborate the Appellant's statement.  That additional search was conducted following the 2013 Remand, but no objective corroboration of any alleged stressor has been located.\n\nThe AOJ has complied with the Board's instructions and that the above described actions taken by the RO substantially comply with the Board's remand directives over the course of the three Remands.  Stegall v. West, Vet App. 268 (1998). \n\nThe Veteran's discussion of the evidence at the 2008 hearing before the Board, and the focus on the evidence necessary to substantiate the claims, demonstrates that the Veteran understood what evidence was still needed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (2015); Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488, 492, 496 (2010).  In any event, as noted above, additional notice was issued following the Board's 2009, 2011, and 2013 Remands.  If any notice deficiency remained following the Veteran's hearing, that deficiency was addressed in the post-hearing communications to the Veteran.  \n\nVA's duties to notify and assist the Veteran have been met.  \n\n\nORDER\n\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\nTresa M.

in St. Petersburg, Florida\n\n\nTHE ISSUE\n\nEntitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n\nREPRESENTATION\n\nAppellant represented by:\tJoseph R. Moore, Esq.\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\n\nC. Ryan, Associate Counsel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran served on active duty from January 1968 to December 1969. \n\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nThe Board notes that in November 2012, the Veteran initially requested a hearing.  At the time, the Veteran's representative, the Florida Department of Veteran Affairs (FDVA) requested that if the Veteran did not receive a hearing, the claims file should be returned to the FDVA so it might prepare an informal hearing presentation.  In December 2015, the Veteran retained a private lawyer, Joseph R. Moore.  In March 2016, Mr. Moore cancelled the Veteran's hearing request.  Because the Veteran is no longer represented by the FDVA, the Board finds it unnecessary to return the claims folder. \n\nIn addition, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's representative's request for a stay of proceedings and a copy of the Veteran's claims file.  However, given the disposition below, the Board finds no prejudice will attach by issuing this decision, as it is fully favorable to the Veteran regarding the issue on appeal.  \n\n\nFINDING OF FACT\n\nThe Veteran suffers from PTSD that is linked to a confirmed in-service stressor.\n\n\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\n\nThe criteria for service connection for PTSD are met.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304 (2015).\n\n\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe Veteran believes he is entitled to service connection for PTSD.  For the following reasons, the Board finds service connection is warranted.\n\nService connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\n\nService connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). \n\nIn addition to the general requirements for service connection, PTSD claims require: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition; (2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).  A diagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a), which provides that all psychiatric diagnoses must conform to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).\n\nThe evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a stressor during service to support a diagnosis of PTSD will vary depending upon whether the Veteran\nengaged in \"combat with the enemy,\" as established by recognized military combat citations or other official records.  See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  If VA determines the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the alleged stressor is combat-related, then the Veteran's lay testimony or statement is accepted as conclusive evidence of the stressor's occurrence and no further development or corroborative evidence is required, provided that such testimony is found to be \"satisfactory\"-i.e., credible, and \"consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of service.\"  See 38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(b); see also Dizoglio v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 163, 164 (1996).  If, however, the Veteran's stressor is unrelated to participation in combat, then lay testimony, in and of itself, is insufficient to corroborate the stressor.  The record must contain credible supporting information from an independent source that corroborates his testimony or statements, such as service records.  See Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 146-47; see also Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 394-95 (1996).\n\nApart from the above provisions, VA revised the regulation governing adjudication of claims for service connection for PTSD, effective July 13, 2010.  See 75 Fed. Reg. 39,843 (since codified at 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3)).  The revised regulation essentially eases the requirement that there be corroboration of a claimed in-service stressor.  Under this standard, if a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, provided the stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the stressor.\n\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  To deny a claim on its merits, the evidence must preponderate against the claim.  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996).\n\nA review of the facts reveals the following: in October 2002, the Veteran underwent a Compensation and Pension (C&P) examination for PTSD, in which the examiner determined the Veteran suffered from PTSD, as well as a depressive disorder.  The Veteran explained his PTSD worsened in 2000, when he switched from working night shift to day shift, and he was forced to frequently interact with co-workers and family members.  The stress of such interactions increased his temper, and he became verbally abusive toward his family members.  Shortly thereafter, he entered treatment at the VA and enrolled in private mental health services where he was diagnosed with depressive disorder and PTSD.\n\nThe Veteran informed the examiner he dreamed often, but only occasionally about Vietnam.  Following his discharge, he often awoke from sleep screaming and in a panicked state, and he still experienced daily, recurrent thoughts of Vietnam.  Moreover, he was forced to actively avoid veteran associations or discussions of combat.  He tended to avoid crowds or groups of people because of feelings of potential danger or threat and heightened anxiety.  He avoided others out of a fear of losing control and angry impulses.  Lastly, he experienced trouble controlling his temper and struggled to interact with others at work and with his family.  Socially, the Veteran maintained one or two friendships.\n\nThe examiner determined the Veteran was alert and oriented to all spheres.  His appearance was clean, and he was adequately dressed and groomed.  His speech was coherent and of a normal rate, rhythm, and tone.  He displayed good eye contact and demonstrated appropriate interpersonal interaction.  His thought process was logical and goal directed, and he exhibited no overt or reported signs of psychosis, delusion, or hallucination.\n\nThe examiner concluded that the Veteran suffered from both PTSD and a depressive disorder.  The Veteran's experiences in Vietnam served as his traumatic stressor.  The examiner believed the Veteran's PTSD developed following his discharge from the service.\n\nFollowing the examination, the Veteran was consistently and continuously diagnosed with PTSD, continued to report symptoms of PTSD, and continuously received both in-patient and out-patient PTSD counseling from 2002 until 2009.\n\nIn December 2007, the Veteran submitted a statement, concluding that his PTSD caused him to mentally break down at VA hospitals, receive disciplinary charges at work, and forced him to undergo hospitalization for psychiatric care in January 2005.\n\nIn December 2009, the Veteran underwent a C&P examination for PTSD.  However, the Veteran did not complete the exam due to his mental angst.  Prior to the examination, the Veteran had asked for and received from his treating psychologist a note stipulating that his wife should be allowed to attend the C&P examination with him.  Upon arriving for the C&P examination, the examiner informed him his wife was not allowed to attend.  This upset the Veteran to such a degree the examiner was forced to end the examination.\n\nIn December 2009, the Veteran's daughter submitted a statement in which she concluded her father's PTSD had worsened over the past few months, and she was very worried about his anger.  She stated that she never knew what was going to happen around him, and although he continued to receive treatment at the VA, his condition had worsened, not improved.\n\nIn March 2012, the Veteran received another C&P examination for PTSD, in which the examiner determined the Veteran did not suffer from PTSD.  She concluded that the Veteran did not meet PTSD criteria under the DSM-IV Criteria B (re-experiencing), Criteria C (avoidance and numbing), or Criteria D (hyperarousal).  The examiner indicated that under Criteria B (re-experiencing), the Veteran did not suffer from recurrent distressing thoughts of the event, or recurrent distressing dreams of the event.  Under Criteria C (avoidance and numbing), the Veteran did not actively avoid activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma.  Under Criteria D (hyperarousal), the examiner indicated the Veteran did not suffer from irritability or outbursts of anger.  Moreover, the examiner could not explain why the Veteran had been diagnosed with PTSD by past treatment providers because she could not review how those providers arrived at a diagnosis.  Lastly, she opined that the Veteran merely suffered from isolated symptoms of PTSD which were not sufficient to make a PTSD diagnosis under the DSM-IV. \n\nIn June 2012, the Veteran submitted a statement explaining that he had received continuous PTSD diagnoses for the past 10 to 12 years, and he continued to suffer from the disease.\n\nThe Board begins by noting that due to the Veteran's combat service in Vietnam, the RO conceded the existence of in-service stressors.  Thus, a discussion concerning stressors is unnecessary.\n\nThe Board finds that the evidence supports the Veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD.  First, the record demonstrates the Veteran served in Vietnam, and the RO conceded that the Veteran's in-service stressors occurred.  Second, the Veteran's VA treating physicians believe the Veteran suffers from PTSD.  For more than the past decade, the Veteran has complained of and sought treatment for PTSD, and the providers whom the Veteran saw on a daily basis concluded the Veteran suffered from PTSD.  Last, the October 2002 C&P examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and concluded that the Veteran's PTSD stemmed from his service in the military.\n\nIn March 2012, the Veteran underwent a C&P examination for PTSD, in which the examiner concluded the Veteran did not suffer from PTSD.  In making this finding, the examiner determined the Veteran did not suffer from the following: recurrent distressing thoughts of the event; recurrent distressing dreams of the event; an avoidance of activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma; or irritability or outbursts of anger.  The record, however, directly contradicts those findings.  In the October 2002 statement, the Veteran informed the examiner he experienced daily, recurrent thoughts of Vietnam, occasional nightmares, and that he actively avoided veterans and activities associated with Vietnam.  Moreover, the Veteran explained to the examiner that he frequently suffered from irritability and anger outbursts with his family and co-workers, and the Veteran continued to assert that in his lay statements.  In December 2009, the Veteran's daughter submitted a letter to the RO in which she stated she was worried about her father's worsening anger, unpredictability, and irritability.  Due to the fact that the March 2012 examiner mischaracterized the Veteran's symptoms and behavior, the Board finds the examination and examiner's conclusion less than probative.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460-61 (1993) (finding that medical opinions based on incomplete or inaccurate factual premises are not probative). \n\nAccordingly, given the Veteran's treating physicians' multiple diagnoses of PTSD, the Board finds the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran has PTSD and its relation to service.\n\nIn addition to the general requirements for service connection, PTSD claims require: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition; (2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).  A diagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a), which provides that all psychiatric diagnoses must conform to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).\n\nIn this situation, the evidence establishes the Veteran has (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition; (2) the October 2002 C&P examiner determined the Veteran's PTSD traumatic stressor concerned his experience in Vietnam with a mortar attack; and (3) the RO has conceded that the Veteran's claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).\n\nThe Board finds the evidence concerning service connection to PTSD is at least in equipoise.  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  Accordingly, the criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met.\n\n\nORDER\n\nService connection for PTSD is granted. \n\n\n\n_________________________________________________\nBRADLEY W.

Chisholm, Attorney\n\n\nWITNESS AT HEARING ON APPEAL\n\nThe Veteran\n\n\n\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\n\nTracie N. Wesner, Associate Counsel\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1974 to May 1975.\n\nThis matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2006 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Waco, Texas.   The Veteran presented sworn testimony at a hearing before a Decision Review Officer in October 2007.  A transcript of that hearing is of record. \n\nIn September 2010, the Board remanded the claims for further development, including a VA examination.  In a June 2011 decision, the Board denied the claims for service connection of PTSD and a psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.  The Veteran appealed the Board's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In December 2011, the Court granted a Joint Motion to Vacate and Remand the Board's decision, finding that the Board failed to discuss the application of the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C.A. § 1111. \n\nIn January 2013, the Board obtained an expert medical opinion from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) regarding whether the Veteran had any psychiatric disorders that pre-existed service.  In January 2013, the Veteran and his attorney were provided with a copy of the VHA opinion.  In January and in March 2013, the Veteran's attorney submitted additional argument and evidence. \n\nThe Board remanded the Veteran's claims for further development in November 2013 and in November 2015.  Additional VA examinations were conducted and opinions rendered in November 2013 and March 2016.  In June 2016, the Veteran's attorney submitted additional argument accompanied by a waiver of the Veteran's right to have this evidence initially considered by the RO.  Accordingly, the Board may consider this evidence in the first instance.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304(c) (2015).     \n\nThe Board acknowledges the argument of the Veteran's attorney that improper development was completed, citing the Court's decision in Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305 (2003).  However, the Court has since qualified certain \"broad, general\" language in Mariano by explaining that the VA \"has an affirmative duty to gather the evidence necessary to render an informed decision on the claim, even if that means gathering and developing negative evidence, provided [it] does so in an impartial, unbiased, and neutral manner.\"  Herbert v. McDonald, 791 F.3d 1364, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting Douglas v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 19, 25-26 (2009)(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n1.  It is at least as likely as not that the Veteran has PTSD resulting from the death of his brother, which was an event that occurred during the Veteran's active military service.  \n\n2.  Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the evidence shows that his diagnosed MDD, dysthymia and depressive disorder NOS had their onset during his active military service.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n1.  The criteria for entitlement to service connection for PTSD are met.  38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1111, 1154(a), 5107(b) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304(f) (2015).\n\n2.  The criteria for entitlement to service connection for MDD, dysthymia and depressive disorder NOS are met. 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1110, 1111, 1154(a), 5107(b) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (2015).\n\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe Veteran seeks service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD, and depression (diagnosed at various times as MDD, dysthymia and depressive disorder NOS).  The Veteran's younger brother died in a car accident while the Veteran was serving on active duty.  He reports that after the death of his brother, he began experiencing nightmares, depression, social isolation and other psychiatric symptoms.  He reports that he turned to God and religion in an attempt to deal with his pain.  His service records show that he applied for and was granted a discharge from the Army as a conscientious objector.  The Veteran reports that his psychiatric symptoms not only persisted, but worsened after his separation from service, leading to multiple suicide attempts starting in 1976.  His medical records show that he has been treated for psychiatric symptoms since 1984, and has been hospitalized on several occasions as a result of suicide attempts.  He asserts that his continuing symptoms are related to the death of his brother during service.    \n\nThe Board finds that service connection is warranted for an acquired psychiatric disorder, diagnosed as PTSD, MDD, dysthymia and depression NOS.  Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed.Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).  \n\nEstablishing service connection for PTSD generally requires:  (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) (2015); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).\n\nA diagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a), which mandates that, for VA purposes, all mental disorder diagnoses must conform to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM).  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) (2015).  The Board notes that during the pendency of the Veteran's appeal, the VA amended the applicable regulations to transition to the use of the DSM-5.  See 80 Fed. Reg. 14308 (March 19, 2015).  \n\nAs an initial matter, the Board notes that the presumption of soundness applies in this matter.  A veteran will be considered to have been in sound condition when examined and accepted for service, except as to disorders noted on entrance into service, or when clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the disability existed prior to service and was not aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. § 1111 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b) (2015).  Although there is evidence of record that the Veteran experienced some psychiatric symptoms prior to service, his May 1974 entrance examination revealed no psychiatric disorder.  Additionally, even though an October 2010 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD and depression had their onset prior to service, the January 2013 VA examiner opined that it was not undebatable that the Veteran's PTSD and depression pre-existed service.  Thus, the Board finds that presumption of soundness applies in this matter and has not been rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence.  The issue in this case is whether the Veteran's PTSD and/or depression had an onset in service or is due to an event occurring in service.   \n\nThe Board finds that service connection for PTSD is warranted because the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD linked to the death of his brother during service.  There is no dispute that the Veteran's brother died in October 1974, while the Veteran was serving on active duty.  The issue for adjudication is whether he has a diagnosis of PTSD that is linked to his brother's death.  The Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise.  The Veteran submitted private medical opinions in September 2012, February 2013 and April 2014 in which clinical psychologist J. Smith opined that the Veteran met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and that the diagnosis of PTSD is linked to the death of his brother.  See September 2012, February 2013 and April 2014 Private Medical Opinions of J. Smith, Ph.D.  The Veteran's VA medical records also show a diagnosis of PTSD during the appeal period.  The Board finds this evidence sufficient to establish a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with the applicable regulations.  See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140 (1997).  \n\nThe Board notes that the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners both opined that the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under either the DSM IV or the DSM 5 because his stressor fails to meet Criterion A necessary for PTSD diagnosis.  The November 2013 VA examiner also opined that the Veteran denied current significant re-experiencing (Criterion B) symptoms and further denied significant avoidance and impairment in functioning symptoms regarding his reported stressor.  However, in his April 2014 addendum opinion, Dr. Smith addressed these criteria, stating that the death of the Veteran's brother did meet Criterion A because the Veteran was confronted with the death of his brother and his response to this news was one of horror and helplessness.  Dr. Smith further noted that the diagnosis of PTSD reflects continuing symptoms of poor sleep, marked and continuing anxiety and depression, continued intrusion of \"triggering\" experiences and events such as contact with his family or hearing reports on the news of young people dying in a hit and run situation, and avoidance of the area of where his brother died.  The October 2010 VA examiner also noted that the Veteran reported experiencing intrusive thoughts related to his brother on a weekly basis, and avoidance of therapy because the he \"doesn't like to bring up the past.\"  Thus, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise on the issue of whether the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD relating to his brother's death.  38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b).  Consequently, service connection for PTSD is warranted. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304(f); see also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  \n\nThe Board also finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's depression is related to the death of his younger brother.  The Veteran reported experiencing psychiatric symptoms, including depression, social isolation and nightmares, in service and since his discharge from service.  He stated that he experienced a \"radical change,\" and tried turning to religion.  See October 2007 Hearing Tr. at 2.  The Veteran also reported attempting suicide within one year after his separation from service, and attempting suicide multiple times before seeking treatment in 1984.  The Veteran is competent to offer testimony regarding the symptoms he experienced.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).  \n\nThe Board observes that there is evidence of record that contradicts the Veteran's assertion that his symptoms started in service and have been recurrent since that time.  Most notably, he was examined multiple times in service and found to have no psychiatric disorder.  See February 1975 Report of Mental Status Evaluation; see also May 1975 Mental Hygiene Consultation Report.  However, the Veteran reported that his psychiatric examination was very brief.  Additionally, Dr. Smith opined that the examination \"appeared to be simply designed to meet an administrative requirement and did not constitute a full psychiatric examination\" because the examination report showed no evidence that the examiner explored the Veteran's reaction to his brother's death.  See April 2014 Addendum Private Medical Opinion of J. Smith.  Thus, the Board does not find the lack of a psychiatric diagnosis on examination during service to be determinative.  \n\nAfter weighing the evidence and affording the Veteran the benefit of all reasonable doubt, the Board finds his reports regarding the onset and continuation of his depressive symptoms to be credible.  As noted by the March 2016, the Veteran's reports of ongoing psychiatric symptoms have been consistent.  In August 1989, when discussing the history of his depression, he stated that his brother's death had been very traumatic for him.  See August 1989 VA Medical Record.  At a February 2006 group therapy session, he talked about how his brother's death was \"still bothering him.\"  See February 2006 VA Medical Record.  During an April 2006 examination performed in connection with his Social Security disability claim, he stated that he thought his psychological symptoms were due, at least in part, to the death of his brother.  See April 2006 Psychological Examination Report.  The Board notes that he reported having \"problems\" beginning in 1984, but that during the same time frame he also reported first seeking treatment in 1984 and first experiencing an impact in his ability to work in 1984.  Thus, it appears that he did not mean that his symptoms started at that time, but that he became significantly impaired in 1984.  At his October 2007 hearing, he again reported having an onset of depressive symptoms in service.  See October 2007 Hearing Tr. at 2-4.  During the October 2010 VA examination, he reported \"increased\" depression after the loss of his brother.  He also reported that he attempted suicide in the early 1970s after service, and that his suicide attempts have been primarily by overdose, carbon monoxide poisoning and a few times by placing a gun to his head without pulling the trigger.  This report is consistent with his statements made during his interview with Dr. Smith (as reported in the September 2012 independent evaluation report), the statements captured in his February 2013 affidavit, and the statements made during the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examinations.  In light of the consistencies in the Veteran's reports concerning the onset and continuity of his symptoms, the Board finds his testimony credible.\n\nBecause the Board finds the Veteran's reports of his recurrent psychiatric symptoms to be credible, it affords more probative value to the opinions of the Dr. Smith, and less probative value to the opinions of the VA examiners.  The November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners opined that the Veteran's depression was not related to his brother's death because there were no contemporaneous medical records confirming his reports of depressive symptoms prior to 1984.  The November 2013 VA examiner also reasoned that there were no mention of mental health issues in the letters the Veteran submitted from friends and family in support of his discharge from service.  In general, a VA examiner may not rely on the absence of evidence as negative evidence, particularly where there is no indication that the fact should have been recorded.  See, e.g., Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272-75 (2015); Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 223-24 (2011).  In this case, as noted by Dr. Smith, \"absence of a formal record of care in no way proves that symptoms were not present, nor does it suggest that care was not needed- only that formal care had not as yet been sought.\"  April 2014 Private Addendum Opinion of J. Smith.  Additionally, there is no reason for the Board to determine that there would be reports of psychiatric symptoms contained in the letters provided by the Veteran's friends and family in support of his request for discharge from service based on his religious beliefs.  The evidence of record shows that the purpose of those letters was to corroborate the Veteran's assertion that his change in religious viewed prevented him from serving on active duty; consequently, it is not expected that any discussion of depressive symptoms would be included in such letters.  For these reasons, the Board affords the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners' negative nexus opinions little probative value.  \n\nAs all three elements necessary to establish service connection have been met, service connection for depression (diagnosed as MDD, dysthymia and depressive disorder NOS) is warranted.  \n\n\n\nORDER\n\nService connection for PTSD is granted.\n\nService connection for major depressive disorder, dysthymia and depressive disorder NOS is granted.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\nSTEVEN D.

In August 2008, July 2014, and February 2016, the Board remanded the issues on appeal for additional development. \r\n\r\nThe record consists of electronic claims files and has been reviewed.  New and relevant evidence has not been added to the record since the most recent Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) dated in November 2016.     \r\n\r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2016).  38 U.S.C.A. � 7107(a)(2) (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  A chronic acquired psychiatric disability was not manifest during service or within one year of discharge from service, and is not attributable to service.\r\n\r\n2.  Chronic lipomas and/or dermatitis were not manifest during service and are not attributable to service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  A chronic acquired psychiatric disability was not incurred in or aggravated by service, and may not be presumed related to service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2016).\r\n\r\n2.  Chronic lipomas and/or dermatitis were not incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303 (2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nI. Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000\r\n\r\nVA has a duty to notify and to assist the Veteran in the development of his claims.  In correspondence to the Veteran dated from September 2005, VA notified the Veteran of the information and evidence needed to substantiate and complete the claims decided here, to include notice of what part of that evidence is to be provided by the claimant, what part VA will attempt to obtain, and how service connection claims, disability ratings, and effective dates are determined.  See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473 (2006).  With regard to the duty to assist, the Veteran's medical records, to include service treatment records (STRs), VA and private treatment records, and medical evidence from the Social Security Administration (SSA), have been obtained.  Moreover, the Veteran underwent VA examinations during the appeal period.  \r\n\r\nThe Board finds that further action is unnecessary under 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A and 38 C.F.R. � 3.159.  The Veteran will not be prejudiced as a result of the Board's adjudication of the issues below.\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection \r\n\r\nThe Veteran claims that he incurred psychiatric and skin disabilities during active duty.       \r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.303 (2016).  To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service - the so-called \"nexus\" requirement.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  Under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b), the evidentiary burden for combat veterans with respect to evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease is reduced.  See Collette v. Brown, 82 F.3d 389, 392 (Fed.Cir.1996).  \r\n\r\nWhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt will be granted to the claimant.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 4.3; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  To deny a claim on the merits, the preponderance of the evidence must be against the claim.  Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996).\r\n\r\nAcquired Psychiatric Disability\r\n\r\nSince December 1990, the Veteran has claimed service connection for acquired psychiatric disability.  His claim had been denied in prior final Board and rating decisions.  In the claim now addressed on appeal, submitted in August 2005, the Veteran asserted that he incurred posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the early 1970s due to combat exposure in the Republic of Vietnam.  His claim to reopen service connection was denied in the December 2005 rating decision on appeal.  In August 2008, the Board reopened the claim and subsequently remanded it for additional evidentiary development.  \r\n\r\nUnder 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f), there are particular requirements for establishing PTSD that are separate from those for establishing service connection generally.  Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) and 38 C.F.R. � 4.125 (requiring PTSD diagnoses to conform to the DSM-IV-V).\r\n\r\nIf a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  \"Fear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device (IED); vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3).\r\n\r\nMoreover, for veterans who served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities such as psychosis are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307(a), 3.309(a).  For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge is required to support the claim.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (the theory of continuity of symptomatology can be used only in cases involving those disabilities specified as chronic under 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a)).\r\nIn assessing this claim, the Board will consider any acquired psychiatric disorder diagnosed during the appeal period.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (when a claimant makes a claim, he is seeking service connection for symptoms regardless of how those symptoms are diagnosed or labeled).  See also Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181, 182 (1998) (in the absence of medical evidence that does so, VA is precluded from differentiating between symptomatology attributed to a nonservice-connected disability and symptomatology attributed to a service-connected disability).  \r\n\r\nThe evidence consists of STRs, private and VA treatment records, records from the Social Security Administration (SSA), lay assertions from the Veteran, and VA compensation examination reports.  This evidence documents that the Veteran has acquired psychiatric disability.  Medical evidence dated from the early 1990s notes diagnoses of depressive disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia, PTSD, and alcohol induced psychosis with hallucinations during withdrawal.  The evidence also indicates that the Veteran experienced a combat stressor during service.  The record documents that the Veteran served in Vietnam from January 1970 to June 1971.  In an October 2005 lay statement of record, the Veteran described exposure to combat conditions while serving there as a truck driver.  He described undergoing enemy attacks and witnessing the deaths of fellow service members.  In an April 2012 VA compensation examination report, an examining psychiatrist found that these experiences amounted to in-service stressors.  As such, the evidence shows that the Veteran incurred combat stressors during active duty.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154; 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nThe record demonstrates, however, that post-service psychiatric problems are unrelated to the in-service stressors.  The preponderance of the evidence indicates that the Veteran did not have a chronic psychiatric disability during service, and did not manifest within the first year of discharge from service a disorder such as psychosis.  See 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  The STRs do not indicate psychiatric disability during service.  In fact, the Veteran's psychological state was specifically examined in the months prior to his August 1972 discharge from service.  Medical reports dated between March and May 1972 indicate that the Veteran experienced conflict with medical treating personnel while undergoing treatment for back disability.  Treating personnel suspected possible malingering related to the injury.  In response, the Veteran underwent psychological evaluation.  In a May 1972 report, the evaluating psychologist indicated that no psychiatric disability or symptoms were found.  Further, the April 1972 discharge report of medical examination notes the Veteran's psychiatric state as normal, while a June 1972 medical evaluation board report addressing orthopedic disability is negative for psychiatric disability, as is a June 1972 physical evaluation board (PEB) report.  \r\n\r\nWith regard to the issue of presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a), the record contains no medical evidence dated between August 1972 and August 1973 - within the first year of discharge from service - indicating chronic psychiatric disability.  Psychiatric problems are not noted in VA medical reports and treatment records dated from the early 1970s through the 1980s.  And the Veteran did not mention psychiatric problems in multiple claims he filed following service (for orthopedic disabilities), prior to his original service connection claim for psychiatric disability in 1990.  Indeed, the earliest post-service evidence of an acquired psychiatric disability is found in a September 1990 private psychiatry report, which notes diagnoses of schizophrenia and PTSD.  This report is dated over 18 years after discharge from active duty.  See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the passage of years between discharge from active service and the medical documentation of a claimed disability may be considered in evaluating a claim of service connection).  \r\n\r\nThus, no evidence dated between August 1972 and September 1990 indicates that the Veteran then had chronic psychiatric disability.  Notwithstanding his claim to service connection related to combat conditions in Vietnam in the early 1970s, the record does not document the existence of chronic psychiatric disability during service, within the first year of separation from service, or for multiple years following service.  The preponderance of the evidence indicates that, for years following service, the Veteran did not have characteristic manifestations sufficient to identify a chronic disease entity.  See 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; see also Walker, supra.    \r\n\r\nThe medical nexus evidence also indicates that acquired psychiatric disability is not related to service.  In the only medical opinion of record to comment on the issue of medical nexus, the December 2012 VA examiner found the in-service stressors unrelated to current psychiatric problems.  The examiner diagnosed psychosis, with hallucinations due to alcohol abuse.  The examiner found that the Veteran did not have PTSD or any other psychiatric disorder in addition to psychosis.  And the examiner found the psychosis likely unrelated to service.  This examiner indicated a review of the claims file, and noted that an interview of the Veteran and a personal examination of the Veteran were both conducted.  In the report, the examiner also detailed the Veteran's medical history of psychiatric issues.  Further, the examiner reiterated her opinion in an October 2014 addendum opinion, which was requested by the Board in the July 2014 remand.  As the opinion is based on the evidence of record detailed earlier, and is explained, the opinion is of probative value.  See Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999) (the value of a physician's statement is dependent, in part, upon the extent to which it reflects clinical data or other rationale to support the opinion).  \r\n\r\nThe record contains multiple VA and private reports and treatment records dated between 1990 and 2014 addressing the issue of psychiatric disability.  These reports and records note acquired psychiatric disability such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia, and alcohol induced psychosis.  None the reports and records, other than the December 2012 VA report and October 2014 addendum report, provides a medical opinion addressing the issue of medical nexus.  Moreover, the PTSD diagnosis is only noted in private reports dated in September 1990 and July 2005.  These reports do not provide a rationale explaining the basis for providing such a diagnosis.  The reports merely note the Veteran's adverse symptoms, his experiences, and the diagnosis without any explanation.  See Bloom, supra.  Importantly, none of the examining or treating VA medical personnel diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD.  In sum, the evidence is not sufficient to find that the Veteran has PTSD related to his experiences in Vietnam.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f). \r\n\r\nIn assessing this claim, the Board has considered the Veteran's complaints of psychiatric difficulty.  He is competent to report observable symptoms such as mental anguish and limitation.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, on the issues of diagnosis and etiology, the medical evidence is more credible.  The development of a psychiatric problem is an internal pathology beyond the Veteran's capacity to observe.  It is a complex question of etiology which requires the determination of a medical professional.  See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007).  Indeed, the lay evidence on this question is medically insignificant when compared with the findings by the neutral and informed December 2012 VA examiner.  In weighing the evidence, the Board finds that the medical evidence of record, and the lack thereof, preponderates against the Veteran's claim regarding diagnosis and etiology.  See Alemany and Gilbert, both supra.  \r\n\r\nAs the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim to service connection for a psychiatric disability, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107; 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.\r\n\r\nSkin Disability\r\n\r\nSince April 1990, the Veteran has claimed service connection for skin disorders due to service in Vietnam and exposure to herbicides there.  In August 1994, the RO denied his original claim in an unappealed rating decision, which became final.  In the claim now addressed on appeal, submitted in May 2010, the Veteran attempted to reopen the issue.  The RO denied his claim in the March 2011 rating decision on appeal.  In July 2014, the Board reopened the claim and subsequently remanded it for additional evidentiary development.  In February 2016, the Board found service connection warranted for two skin disorders - actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma.  The Board explained in the decision that the evidence of record was in equipoise regarding whether the Veteran's sun exposure during service in Vietnam led to subsequent development of these skin problems.  In that decision the Board also remanded for additional development the issue of whether two other skin disorders - lipomas and seborrheic dermatitis - relate to service in general, or to herbicides exposure in Vietnam in particular.  See Clemons and Mittleider, both supra.  \r\n\r\nVA regulations provide that a veteran who had active military, naval, or air service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam Era (beginning on January 9, 1962 and ending on May 7, 1975) shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service.  38 U.S.C.A. � 3.307(a)(6)(iii).  In such circumstances, service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for any disease listed in 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(e).  The record documents that the Veteran served in Vietnam during the applicable time period and was therefore presumably exposed to herbicides there.  However, the list of multiple chronic disorders noted under 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(e) does not include the two skin disorders at issue here - seborrheic dermatitis and lipomas.  As such, this regulation is inapplicable to the claims on appeal.  The Board further notes that these two skin disorders are not among the listed chronic disorders in 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a).  Nevertheless, the Board will consider the direct service connection theory of entitlement for the Veteran's claim.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303; Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1994); Ramey v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 40, 44 (1996).\r\n\r\nThe evidence consists of STRs, private and VA treatment records, records from SSA, lay assertions from the Veteran, and VA compensation examination reports.  This evidence documents that the Veteran has had during the appeal period lipomas and seborrheic dermatitis.  In fact, these skin disorders are diagnosed in the most recent VA compensation examination report addressing the Veteran's skin, dated in October 2016.  The evidence also indicates that the Veteran experienced a skin disorder during service.  A March 1972 STR notes erythematous plaque in the groin area, which was believed to be herpes simplex.  \r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence indicates, however, that the Veteran did not have a chronic skin disorder during service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  The STRs indicate that the Veteran did not have a chronic skin disorder during service.  The STRs dated prior to and following the March 1972 STR noting erythematous plaque are negative for skin problems.  The April 1972 discharge report of medical examination notes the Veteran's skin as normal, with the exception of scar tissue related to orthopedic injuries.  And the June 1972 medical board report and PEB report addressing orthopedic disability are negative for skin disability.  Further, the evidence dated soon after service is negative for skin disability.  A January 1973 VA general medical examination report found the Veteran's skin to be normal.  Skin problems are not noted in VA medical reports and treatment records dated from the early 1970s to the late 1980s.  And the Veteran did not mention skin problems in multiple claims he filed following service, prior to his original service connection claim for skin disability in 1990.  Indeed, the earliest post-service evidence of skin disability is found in a November 1987 VA dermatology treatment record noting complaints of skin rashes, including on the scalp.  This report is dated over 15 years after discharge from active duty.  See Maxson, supra.  Thus, no evidence dated between August 1972 and November 1987 indicates that the Veteran then had chronic skin disability.  The record does not document the existence of chronic skin disability during service or for multiple years following service.  The preponderance of the evidence indicates that, for years following service, the Veteran did not have characteristic manifestations sufficient to identify a chronic disease entity.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.    \r\n\r\nFurther, the medical nexus evidence indicates that lipomas and seborrheic dermatitis are not related to service.  The Veteran has undergone three VA compensation examinations into his skin, in January 2011, October 2014, and October 2016.  In the July 2014 and February 2016 remands, the Board found the January 2011 and October 2014 examination reports inadequate with regard to the two disorders at issue here - lipomas and seborrheic dermatitis.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (noting that once VA undertakes an examination, an adequate one must be produced).  Pursuant to the February 2016 remand, an adequate examination report and opinion (dated in October 2016) has been included in the record.  See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991) (when medical evidence is inadequate, VA must supplement the record with an advisory opinion or with another medical examination report).  \r\n\r\nIn the October 2016 report, the VA examiner noted the Veteran's complaints of \"palpable lumps (lipoma) in trunk and extremities for years.\"  The Veteran also reported \"erythematous scaling rash in face and ears\" for the past 10 years.  On examination, the examiner noted mild seborrheic dermatitis on the eyebrows, nasal folds, and behind the ears.  The examiner also noted \"non-tender subcutaneous nodules (benign tumors) scattered on extremities and trunk[.]\"  In the opinion, the examiner found these skin problems likely unrelated to service.  In support, the examiner noted that the STRs and medical evidence did not \"show any evidence of signs, symptoms, diagnosis, treatments or a chronic disability pattern consistent with or suggestive of Lipoma or derma during active military service[.]\"  The examiner also stated that \"[t]he medical literature does not support a direct etiologic relation between past exposure to Agent Orange and further development of\" lipomas or dermatitis.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.303.  The October 2016 VA examiner indicated a review of the claims file, and noted that an interview of the Veteran and a personal examination of the Veteran were both conducted.  In the report, the examiner also detailed the Veteran's medical history of skin problems.  Further, the report and opinion directly respond to the Board's February 2016 remand requests.  As the opinion is based on the evidence of record detailed earlier, and is explained, the opinion is of probative value.  See Bloom, supra.  \r\n\r\nIn assessing this claim, the Board has considered the Veteran's assertions regarding skin disability, particularly that his problems relate to herbicides exposure.  He is competent to report observable symptoms such as rashes.  See Jandreau, supra.  However, on the issue of etiology, the medical evidence is more credible.  The question of whether lipomas or dermatitis relate to service is a medical determination beyond the Veteran's capacity to observe.  It is a complex question necessitating input from a medical professional.  See Woehlaert, supra.  Indeed, the lay evidence on this question is medically insignificant when compared with the findings by the neutral and informed October 2016 VA examiner.  Thus, in weighing the evidence, the Board finds that the medical evidence of record, and the lack thereof, preponderates against the Veteran's claim regarding etiology.  See Alemany and Gilbert, both supra.   \r\n\r\nAs the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim to service connection for lipomas and seborrheic dermatitis, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107; 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is denied.  \r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for lipomas and seborrheic dermatitis is denied.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nKRISTI L.

Roanoke, Virginia\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUE\r\n\r\nEntitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nVeteran represented by:\tEric A. Gang, Attorney at Law\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY FOR THE BOARD\r\n\r\nP.S. Rubin, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active duty service in the U.S. Marine Corps from February 1973 to September 1975 and in the U.S. Air Force from February 1985 to October 1985.  He also served in the Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Army and Air National Guards of various states from 1975 to 1995.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2005 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in San Diego, California.  Jurisdiction of case has since been transferred to the RO in Roanoke, Virginia.  That office forwarded his appeal to the Board.   \r\n\r\nA review of the Virtual VA paperless claims processing system and the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) reveals additional service treatment records, service personnel records, attorney letters, Veterans Service Organizations (VSO) briefs, and VA treatment records that have been reviewed by the Board.   \r\n\r\nIn an earlier December 2010 Board decision, the Board denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD.  The Veteran appealed the Board's December 2010 decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  \r\n\r\nIn a July 2011 Order, the Court vacated and remanded the Board's decision as to issue of service connection for PTSD, for proceedings consistent with a Joint Motion for Remand (Joint Motion).  \r\n\r\nUpon return from the Court, in May 2012 and May 2016, the Board remanded the PTSD issue for further development.  The case has been returned to the Board for further appellate consideration.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  There is credible supporting evidence of the Veteran's in-service exposure to noncombat-related stressors in the Marine Corps in April 1975 during Operations Eagle Pull and Frequent Wind, involving evacuations in Cambodia and Vietnam.  These stressors included rockets and bombs heard on the outskirts of the cities, mass evacuations of embassy and civilian personnel with panic and unsanitary conditions, and witnessing the bodies of 30 dead marines.\r\n\r\n2.  There is an approximate balance of favorable and unfavorable evidence as to whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD that is related to the confirmed in-service stressors from Cambodia and Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF LAW\r\n\r\nResolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the Veteran has PTSD with depression that was incurred in active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304(f), 3.310, 4.125(a) (2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI.  VA's Duty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), in part, describes VA's duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 (West 2014); Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-154, �� 504, 505, 126 Stat. 1165, 1191-93; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2015).  The VCAA applies to the instant service connection claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.  However, the Veteran was provided adequate VCAA notice for the appeal in May 2004, August 2004, December 2004, April 2005, June 2005, March 2006, and April 2006.  Also, the May 2004 letter included a copy of a VA form with specific instructions for identifying PTSD stressors.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, if any defect in VCAA notice or assistance is found, such defect is not prejudicial to the Veteran, given the completely favorable disposition of the PTSD and depression appeal.  Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 392-94 (1993).  \r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection for PTSD\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  In addition, disorders diagnosed after discharge may also still be service connected if all the evidence, including pertinent service records, establishes the disorder was incurred in service.   38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d).   See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).  As a general matter, service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service - the so-called \"nexus\" requirement.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  \r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD has unique evidentiary requirements.  It generally requires:  (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  See also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  \r\n\r\nEffective August 4, 2014, VA amended the portion of its Schedule for Rating Disabilities dealing with mental disorders and its adjudication regulations that define the term \"psychosis\" to remove outdated references to the DSM-IV and replace them with references to the recently updated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fifth Edition) (the DSM-5).  See 79 Fed. Reg. 45,094 (August 4, 2014).  VA adopted as final, without change, this interim final rule and clarified that the provisions of this interim final rule do not apply to claims that have been certified for appeal to the Board or are pending before the Board on or before August 4, 2014.  See Schedule for Rating Disabilities - Mental Disorders and Definition of Psychosis for Certain VA Purposes, 80 Fed. Reg. 14,308 (March 19, 2015).  In the present case, the RO certified the Veteran's PTSD appeal to the Board in August 2007, several years prior to August 4, 2014.  Thus, DSM-IV is still the governing directive.  That is, the amended 38 C.F.R. � 4.125 conforming to the DSM-5 is not applicable in the present case.  In any event, the Board will still consider any private or VA examiner's discussion of both the DSM-IV and DSM-5 in adjudicating the current Veteran's PTSD claim, in order to provide the Veteran with every benefit of the doubt.  \r\n\r\nIf it is established through military citation or other supportive evidence that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(2). See also 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d); Gaines v. West, 11 Vet. App. 353 (1998) (Board must make a specific finding as to whether the Veteran engaged in combat).  To gain the benefit of a relaxed standard for proof of service incurrence of an injury or disease, 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) requires that the veteran have actually participated in combat with the enemy.  See VAOPGCPREC 12-99. \r\n\r\nIf VA determines either that the veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy or that the veteran did engage in combat, but that the alleged stressor is not combat related, the veteran's lay testimony, by itself, is not sufficient to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  Instead, the record must contain credible supporting evidence that corroborates the veteran's testimony or statements.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); Stone v. Nicholson, 480 F.3d 1111 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 147 (1997); Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996).  \r\n\r\nHowever, corroboration of every detail of a claimed stressor, including the veteran's personal participation, is not required; rather, a veteran only needs to offer independent evidence of a stressful event that is sufficient to imply his or her personal exposure.  See Pentecost v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 124, 128 (2002) (quoting Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997)).  In other words, a veteran's presence with the unit at the time such attacks occurred corroborates his statement that he experienced such attacks personally.  Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307, 311 (1997). \r\n\r\nThe final requirement of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f) is medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service stressor and the current disability.  However, such after-the-fact medical nexus evidence generally cannot also be the sole evidence of the occurrence of the claimed stressor.  Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 396.\r\n\r\nEffective July 13, 2010, if a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to that veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that a veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of that veteran's service, a veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3).\r\n\r\n\"[F]ear of hostile military or terrorist activity\" means that a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the Veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.  See id.  \r\n\r\nA veteran must have experienced, witnessed, or have been confronted by an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of that veteran or others, and that veteran's response to the event or circumstance must have involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror.  The occurrence of an actual event or circumstance is necessary.  In making this determination, VA must duly consider the places, types, and circumstances of a veteran's service as shown by the service record, the official history of each organization in which such a veteran served, a veteran's medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.  The new rule is limited to cases in which the claimed stressor is related to a veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  See 75 Fed. Reg. 39,843 (Jul. 13, 2010).\r\n\r\nWith regard to an actual diagnosis of PTSD, lay persons are not categorically incompetent to speak on matters of medical diagnosis or etiology.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  The Board must consider the type of condition specifically claimed and whether it is readily amenable to lay diagnosis or probative comment on etiology.  See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007).  In this regard, the Federal Circuit recently held that \"PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence . . . is competent and sufficient to identify.\"  Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Regardless, the Board acknowledges the Veteran is competent to report psychiatric symptoms both during and after service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(a)(2); Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 (discussing that Veteran is competent to report a contemporaneous medical diagnosis); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (discussing general competency of a Veteran to report psychiatric symptoms).  \r\n\r\nThat is, lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Davidson, 581 F.3d at 1316.  See also Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77.  \r\n\r\nIn determining whether service connection is warranted, the Board shall consider the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  38 U.S.C.A. 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102; Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1991).\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he has PTSD as the result of exposure to noncombat-related stressors during his service with the Marine Corps from February 1973 to September 1975.  Specifically, he states that while serving as an Amtrac crewman in the Marine Corps in April 1975 during Operations Eagle Pull and Frequent Wind, involving evacuations in Cambodia and Vietnam, he was confronted with several traumatic stressors.  These stressors included hearing rockets and bombs on the outskirts of the cities, witnessing the mass evacuations of embassy and civilian personnel with panic and unsanitary conditions, and witnessing the bodies of 30 dead Marines.  He asserts these incidents were extremely traumatic for him.  He believes his mental problems began during his Vietnam and Cambodia service, and have continued to this day.  The Veteran alleges PTSD-related symptoms since service to include nightmares, insomnia, flashbacks, re-experiencing, intrusive thoughts, avoidance, hypervigilance, detachment, numbness, paranoia, depression, and anxiety.  The Veteran does not assert he received any therapy or treatment for his psychiatric problems until 1997, many years after active duty service.  See March 2008 Veteran's statement; February 2012 buddy statement from soldier who served with the Veteran; April 2012 private counselor opinion; December 2016 VA psychological examination.  \r\n\r\nUpon review of the evidence of record, the Board grants the appeal for service connection for PTSD with depression.  \r\n\r\nInitially, the Veteran's service personnel records (SPRs) and Reports of Separation from the Armed Forces (DD Form 214s) do not reflect receipt of medals, badges, or decorations that specifically denote combat with the enemy.  His military occupational specialty (MOS) was an Amtrac crewman, which is not indicative of combat.  Moreover, his SPRs indicate he did not participate in any combat campaigns and received no wounds due to combat.  Thus, the combat provisions are not for application.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(2).  See also 38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(b) and 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(d) (pertaining to combat Veterans). \r\n\r\nWith respect to the non-combat stressors of hearing rockets and bombs on the outskirts of the cities, witnessing the mass evacuations of embassy and civilian personnel with panic and unsanitary conditions, and witnessing the bodies of 30 dead marines, that occurred at that time off the evacuations of Cambodia and Vietnam in April 1975, there is credible supporting evidence that exposure to these stressors occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 147; Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 395.  \r\n\r\nIn particular, the Veteran has submitted a February 2012 buddy statement from a soldier who served with the Veteran in Cambodia and Vietnam, verifying elements of exposure to the above stressors.  In addition, the Veteran's SPRs and DD Form 215s indicate that he took part in operations Eagle Pull and Frequent Wind.  Both of these operations involved recovery of embassy and civilians from Phnom Pen, Cambodia and Saigon, South Vietnam in April 1975.  The Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) in the Marine Corps as an Amtrac (amphibious tractor) crewman, also provides support for the fact that he was involved in the evacuations. The SPRs verify the Veteran was in a combat zone during coastal operations, patrols, etc., while evacuations were occurring in April 1975.  The Veteran's SPRs confirm the Veteran received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal with one bronze star, and the Humanitarian Service Medal with bronze numeral \"2\" for his service in \"Operation Eagle Pull and Operation Frequent Wind 1975.\"  The Veteran also submitted various internet articles, publications, and eye-witness accounts of the situation in Saigon during the April 1975 evacuations, which described a scene of \"confusion, panic, [and] anxiety\" with \"shells and rockets . . . pounding the outskirts\" of the city.  Thus, this evidence of record shows it was highly plausible the Veteran experienced exposure to these stressors.  Moreover, under the amended PTSD regulation, the December 2016 VA psychological examiner further assessed that the Veteran's stressors were related to his \"fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.\"  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3).  Again, a stressor need not be corroborated in every detail, including the Veteran's personal participation.  Pentecost, 16 Vet. App. at 128.  In summary, there is sufficient credible evidence to verify the occurrence of the Veteran's noncombat- related stressors in April 1975.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f). \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) dated from 1973 to 1975, and in 1985, as well as his National Guard / Reserve records dated from 1975 to 1995, do not reveal any treatment or diagnosis of PTSD or any other acquired psychiatric disorder.  The Veteran denied any depressive symptomatology at various STR and National Guard Reports of Medical History throughout the years up to 1995.  In any event, as to PTSD, an in-service diagnosis is not required.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nPost-service, it appears the Veteran was first treated for PTSD and depression in 1997, according to VA treatment records.  From 1997 to 2016, VA medical personnel in VA treatment records and VA examinations have rendered various diagnoses for the Veteran, to include the following:  depression, mental disorder NOS, mood disorder, adjustment disorder, personality change, schizotypal personality disorder, Asperger's, rule out (R/O) bipolar disorder, R/O psychosis NOS, R/O obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), R/O anxiety NOS, and R/O mood disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury.   \r\n \r\nPost-service, with respect to the criteria of a current diagnosis of PTSD, the threshold consideration for any service connection claim is the existence of a current disability.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303; Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).   In particular, aside from corroboration of an in-service stressor (this element is already met here), current medical evidence diagnosing PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV) is required, as well as competent evidence of a nexus between current PTSD symptomatology and his verified in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  See also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  \r\n\r\nWith regard to a diagnosis of PTSD based on his already confirmed in-service noncombat-related stressors from Operation Eagle Pull and Operation Frequent Wind in April 1975, the record is mixed and reflects several favorable and unfavorable medical opinions and treatment records.  However, upon review of this evidence, the Board concludes that the evidence of record is equally balanced in finding that the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis due to the verified in-service stressors, in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV).  \r\n\r\nThe Board must determine, as a question of fact, both the weight and credibility of the evidence.  Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in a record; every item does not have the same probative value.  The Board must account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, analyze the credibility and probative value of all material evidence submitted by and on behalf of a claimant, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any such evidence.  See Struck v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 145, 152 (1996); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995); Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 40 (1994); Abernathy v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 461, 465 (1992); Simon v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 621, 622 (1992); Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164, 169 (1991).  \r\n\r\nIt is not error for the Board to favor the opinion of one competent medical expert over that of another when the Board gives an adequate statement of reasons or bases.  See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995).\r\n\r\nWhen VA undertakes to provide a medical examination or opinion, it must be adequate.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (\"[O]nce the Secretary undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a service-connection claim ..., he must provide an adequate one....\").  An examination or opinion is adequate if it is \"thorough and contemporaneous,\" considers the Veteran's prior medical examinations and treatment, and \"describes the disability ... in sufficient detail so that the Board's 'evaluation of the claimed disability will be a fully informed one.'\"  Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007) (quoting Ardison v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 405, 407 (1994)); Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121, 124 (1991).  A medical examination report or opinion must also \"contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.\"  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).  The Board errs by relying on an inadequate opinion.  Ardison v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 405, 407 (1994).\r\n\r\nWith regard to favorable evidence, VA mental health practitioners in treatment records dated from 1997 to 2016 have at various times diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD in the context of the above in-service stressors.  See e.g., June 2005 VA Agent Orange History and Physical; 2004 VA Vet Center records; April 1997 VA treatment records.  The Veteran underwent VA PTSD screens in March 2007 and November 2009, and these PTSD screens were positive.  The positive PTSD screens were based on the Veteran's reports of nightmares based on his traumatic military experiences, avoiding situations that remind him of his stressors, being on guard, easily started, numbness, and detachment from others, activities, and surroundings.  \r\n\r\nWith regard to favorable evidence, and most importantly, in April 2012, Ms. A.G., P.C.C., a private counselor, submitted a comprehensive medical opinion concluding that the Veteran has PTSD in accordance with the DSM-IV.  The PTSD diagnosis was deemed secondary to the Veteran's military service from Operations Eagle Pull and Frequent Wind during the Vietnam and Cambodia evacuations - from the chaos of evacuation and exposure to dead bodies.  He also has depressive symptoms secondary to PTSD and his military service.  The private counselor assessed that the Veteran has credibly described PTSD-related symptoms such as avoidance, re-experiencing, flashbacks, nightmares, depression, hyperarousal, insomnia, and anxiety in VA treatment records.  The private counselor did not perform a psychological examination on the Veteran when offering this opinion.  However, she did review extensive records in the Veteran's claims file.  \r\n\r\nPursuant to 38 C.F.R. �4.125(a), if the diagnosis of a mental disorder does not conform to DSM-IV or is not supported by the findings on the examination report, the rating agency shall return the report to the examiner to substantiate the diagnosis.  Mental health professionals are experts and are presumed to know the DSM requirements applicable to their practice and to have taken them into account in providing a PTSD diagnosis.  As such, the Court has held that a PTSD diagnosis provided by a mental-health professional must be presumed to have been made in accordance with the applicable DSM-IV criteria as to both the adequacy of the symptomatology and the sufficiency of the stressor, unless there is evidence to the contrary.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140 (1997).  The DSM-IV cannot be used \"as a basis for rejecting the Veteran's favorable medical evidence as to the sufficiency of a stressor or the adequacy of the Veteran's symptomatology.\"  Id.  As such, in order to make a finding that the Veteran in this case did not have a valid PTSD diagnosis, the Board must clearly articulate its reasons for finding that the PTSD diagnosis was not made in accordance with the DSM-IV requirements.  If the Board cannot support a conclusion that the diagnosis was not made in accordance with DSM-IV requirements, it must accept the diagnosis as valid.  In the present case, the Board will therefore accept the above PTSD diagnoses as valid and in accordance with the DSM-IV.  \r\n\r\nConversely, with regard to the unfavorable evidence, it was a December 2016 VA neuropsychological examiner's medical opinion that the Veteran currently does not meet the full DSM-5 criteria for PTSD.  The Veteran's various in-service stressors during exposure to chaotic evacuations in Operations Eagle Pull and Frequent Wind in April 1975 were acknowledged.  The VA examiner added that these stressors were adequate and were related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  However, even though the Veteran reported cardinal symptoms of PTSD and he met most of the criteria for PTSD under the DSM-5 (he met criteria A, B, D, E, F, G, and H), he nevertheless did not meet criterion \"C.\"  That is, he failed to exhibit persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic events.  The VA examiner reasoned that Veteran does not report consistent DSM-5 Criterion C avoidance behaviors, because he continues to seek out DAV and other veterans for support and assistance.  The Veteran also reported attending war movies such as \"Saving Pvt. Ryan\".  The Veteran was noted to be a very poor historian, responding to many clinical questions with rambling, circumstantial, and off-subject responses.  The Veteran has had marked difficulty providing specific index incidents for his reported PTSD symptoms.  The Veteran was often noted to deflect other questions and return back to his report of cardinal PTSD symptoms.  The Veteran's cognition appeared very loosely associated and occasionally difficult to understand in context. The Veteran's responses were often vague and nonspecific.  Instead, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with schizotypal personality disorder, which preceded his military service.\r\n\r\nBut notably, the December 2016 VA examiner failed to discuss whether the Veteran met a PTSD diagnosis in the context of the applicable DSM-IV.  The VA examiner only addressed the criteria of the DSM-5.  This is significant in the instant case because \"effortful avoidance\" is a required symptom for a PTSD diagnosis in Criterion C of the DSM-5.  In contrast, the DSM-IV also included \"effortful avoidance\" in Criterion C, but it comprised of only two of the requisite seven symptoms, of which only three were required.  In other words, the DSM-IV did not dictate that \"effortful avoidance\" be present in a veteran in order to meet the criteria for PTSD.  The DSM-IV was more flexible on this issue, as opposed to the DSM-5.     \r\n\r\nAs currently codified, VA law defines the \"benefit of the doubt\" doctrine as:\r\n\r\n\tWhen, after consideration of all evidence and material of record in this case before the Department with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary, there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination in the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.\r\n\r\n38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b).  See also 38 C.F.R. � 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).   \r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Board finds that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on the PTSD issue.  Certain elements of both the positive and negative medical opinions in this case are probative.  Both sets of evidence have respective strengths and weaknesses.  In such situations, the benefit of the doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor.  Given the law and the medical evidence of record, the Board is compelled to grant the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and allow service connection for PTSD.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.\r\n\r\nIn making this determination, the Board is cognizant that VA may not order additional development for the sole purpose of obtaining evidence unfavorable to a claimant.  Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Board has also considered whether the Veteran's PTSD claim raised the issue of whether service connection is warranted for any other acquired psychiatric disorder in addition to PTSD.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009) (holding that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record).  In this regard, the record also shows the Veteran has depression as secondary to his service-connected PTSD.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a).  Specifically, in April 2012, Ms. A.G., P.C.C., a private counselor, assessed that the Veteran's depressive symptoms he has consistently displayed are a component of his current PTSD diagnosis.  In addition, VA mental health treatment records dated from 1997 to 2016 frequently discuss the Veteran's depressive symptoms, sometimes interwoven with a PTSD diagnosis. \r\n\r\nThe Board also notes that post-service, the Veteran has been diagnosed with mental disorder NOS, mood disorder, adjustment disorder, personality change, schizotypal personality disorder, Asperger's, rule out (R/O) bipolar disorder, R/O psychosis NOS, R/O obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), R/O anxiety NOS, and R/O mood disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury.  However, there is no evidence or allegation of symptoms of these disorders during service, and no probative evidence linking these diagnoses to the Veteran's military service.    \r\n\r\nWith regard to the Veteran's personality disorder diagnoses, personality disorders are not \"diseases\" or \"injuries\" within the meaning of applicable legislation.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(c), 4.9, 4.127.  Defects are defined as \"structural or inherent abnormalities or conditions which are more or less stationary in nature.\"  VAOPGCPREC 82-90.  It is therefore unnecessary to examine causality, or consider VA's presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1111, because personality disorders cannot legally be service-related.  See Morris v. Shinseki, 678 F.3d 1346, 1354 (2012).  Thus, service connection is not warranted for the Veteran's personality disorders.\r\n \r\nIn any event, the present decision is considered a full grant of the benefits sought by the Veteran for his acquired psychiatric disorder claim to include PTSD.  In granting service connection for PTSD with depression, the RO should assign a disability rating or ratings that encompass the symptoms of these disorders.  See Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377, 1381 (2009) (two defined diagnoses constitute the same disability for purposes of 38 C.F.R. � 4.14 if they have overlapping symptomatology, but bipolar disorder and PTSD could have different symptoms and it could therefore be improper in some circumstances for VA to treat these separately diagnosed conditions as producing only the same disability).  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nSubject to the provisions governing the award of monetary benefits, service connection for PTSD with depression is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nDAVID L.

Rubin, Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Veteran had active duty service from May 1961 to April 1964 in the United States Army.  \r\n\r\nThis matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from November 2011 and September 2012 rating decisions issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in St. Petersburg, Florida. \r\n\r\nThis appeal was processed using Virtual VA and the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS).  Accordingly, any future consideration of this Veteran's case should take into consideration the existence of this electronic record.  \r\n\r\nThe Board observes that in the November 2011 rating decision on appeal, the RO also denied the Veteran's claims for service connection for bilateral trench foot and a dental disability.  However, a review of the record shows that the Veteran did not submit a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) or Substantive Appeal (e.g., VA Form 9 or equivalent statement) for these particular issues.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 7105(a) (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 20.200, 20.201, 20.202, 20.300, 20.302 (2016).  In fact, in a January 2012 NOD pertaining to the issues currently on appeal, the Veteran explicitly stated that he did not wish to pursue the issues of service connection for bilateral trench foot and a dental disability.  Thus, these particular service connection issues are not on appeal before the Board.  \r\n\r\nIn January 2017, the Veteran presented testimony at a Travel Board hearing at the RO before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge.  A transcript of that hearing is associated with VBMS.  \r\n\r\nFinally, the Veteran submitted additional VA treatment records and Vet Center records in January 2017, after certification of his appeal.  However, he waived his right to have the RO initially consider this evidence.  Therefore, the Board accepts this additional evidence for inclusion in the record and consideration by the Board at this time.  See 38 C.F.R. �� 20.800, 20.1304 (2016).   \r\n\r\nThis appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 20.900(c) (2016).  38 U.S.C.A. � 7107(a)(2) (West 2014).\r\n\r\n\r\nFINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n1.  The Veteran does not have a current left face nerve damage disability, that is separate and distinct from the symptoms of his TBI that have already been service-connected.  \r\n\r\n2.  The Veteran's current bilateral eye ocular hypertension, glaucoma, and cataracts are not causally or etiologically related to active service, to include any injury or event therein.  In addition, these disabilities did not develop post-service as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected TBI.  \r\n\r\n3.  The Veteran's current bilateral eye refractive error / presbyopia is not a \"disease\" or \"injury\" under the meaning of applicable law and regulation for VA purposes; in addition, his refractive error was not subject to a superimposed disease or injury during service, resulting in any additional disability.  \r\n\r\n4.  The Veteran has left eye blindness with loss of visual acuity proximately due to or the result of his service-connected TBI with a fracture of the left zygoma.  \r\n\r\n5.  There is credible supporting evidence (including in-service behavioral changes), confirming that the Veteran's alleged in-service physical assault occurred.\r\n\r\n6.  The most probative evidence of record establishes that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD with depression and substance abuse due to an in-service physical assault and TBI, in accordance within the applicable VA regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\r\n\r\n1.  A left face nerve damage disability was not incurred in or aggravated during active service, and is not secondary to his service-connected TBI.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.310, 4.14 (2016).\r\n\r\n2.  A bilateral eye and/or vision disorder, to include ocular hypertension, glaucoma, and cataracts were not incurred in or aggravated by active service, and are not secondary to the Veteran's service-connected TBI.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310 (2016).  \r\n\r\n3.  Bilateral eye refractive error / presbyopia was not incurred in or aggravated by service and was not subject to a superimposed disease or injury in service that resulted in additional disability.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 4.9, 4.127 (2016); VAOPGCPREC 82-90 (July 18, 1990); VAOPGCPREC 67-90 (July 18, 1990).\r\n\r\n4.  Resolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the Veteran left eye blindness with loss of visual acuity is secondary to his service-connected TBI with a fracture of the left zygoma.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.310(a), (d).\r\n\r\n5.  Resolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the Veteran has PTSD with depression and polysubstance abuse that was incurred in active military service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304(f)(5), 3.310, 4.125(a) (2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nI.  VA's Duty to Notify and Assist\r\n\r\nThe Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), in part, describes VA's duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126 (West 2014); Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-154, �� 504, 505, 126 Stat. 1165, 1191-93; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a) (2016).  \r\n\r\nThe VCAA applies to the instant claims for service connection and secondary service connection for left eye blindness with loss of visual acuity and PTSD with depression and polysubstance abuse.  However, the Veteran was provided adequate VCAA notice for these issues in October 2010, November 2010, September 2011, November 2011, and July 2012 letters.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, if any defect in VCAA notice or assistance is found, such defect is not prejudicial to the Veteran, given the completely favorable disposition of the left eye blindness and PTSD with depression and polysubstance abuse issues on appeal.  Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 392-94 (1993).  \r\n\r\nWith regard to the left face nerve damage and bilateral eye disability issues being denied in the present decision, VA's duty to notify was satisfied by VCAA letters dated in October 2010, November 2010, September 2011, and November 2011.  See 38 U.S.C.A. �� 5102, 5103, 5103A (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159 (2016); see also Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015).\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Veteran has received all required notice in this case for these particular service connection issues on appeal for left face nerve damage and a bilateral eye disability (claimed as \"blurred vision\"), such that there is no prejudicial error in the content or timing of VCAA notice.  See also Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U.S. 396 (2009) (an error in VCAA notice should not be presumed prejudicial and the burden of showing harmful error rests with the party raising the issue, to be determined on a case-by-case basis).  There has been no allegation of any error in the VCAA notice provided to the Veteran for these particular issues. \r\n\r\nWith respect to the duty to assist, the RO has obtained the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs), service personnel records (SPRs), VA outpatient treatment records, private medical evidence as authorized by the Veteran, and VA examinations.  For his part, the Veteran has submitted personal statements, hearing testimony, argument from his representative, and additional VA and Vet Center evidence.  The Veteran has not identified any additional, outstanding evidence that is relevant to his service connection claims being denied herein for left face nerve damage and a bilateral eye disability. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran was also afforded VA examinations and opinions in October 2011 and February 2017 to determine the etiology of his left face nerve damage and bilateral eye disability, to include as secondary to a service-connected TBI.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); see also 38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(c)(4).  As will be discussed below, these VA examinations were thorough, supported by explanations, based on a review of the claims folder, and supported by clinical evidence of record.  These VA examinations also considered the Veteran's reported lay history.  As such, there is no basis for any further VA examination or opinion as to the left face nerve damage and bilateral eye disability issues on appeal.  \r\n\r\nAccording to a March 2017 letter to the Veteran from the Social Security Administration (SSA), the SSA indicated they paid disability benefits to the Veteran from 1993 to 2004.  However, these disability benefits were converted to retirement benefits in November 2004 because of the Veteran's advanced age.  In any event, a copy of the September 1994 SSA disability determination submitted by the Veteran concluded that he was disabled due to nonservice-connected lumbar spine, urinary dysfunction, and lower extremity disabilities.  The Veteran was considered to be disabled by the SSA post-service since 1992, after the Veteran injured himself hauling furniture, according to a June 2012 VA psychological examination. Complete SSA disability records are not present in the claims folder.  \r\n\r\nBut most significantly, it is apparent that these SSA disability benefits were only awarded in the context of his nonservice-connected lumbar spine, urinary dysfunction, and lower extremity disabilities.  As there was no reason to suspect the SSA records would change the outcome of the service connection claims being denied in the present case, VA is not obligated to invest further time and resources to obtain them.  See Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1323 (2010) (\"It is not the case that the government must obtain records in every case in order to rule out their relevance.  Such a decision would be akin to a determination that all medical records must be obtained.\")  In essence, efforts to obtain these SSA records are clearly not warranted, as they are not relevant to the claims being denied and would provide no reasonable possibility of substantiating the claims on appeal.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A(a)(2).  \r\n\r\nMoreover, for both the left face nerve damage and bilateral eye issues on appeal, neither the Veteran nor his representative has advanced any procedural arguments in relation to VA's duties to notify and assist.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that \"absent extraordinary circumstances . . . we think it is appropriate for the Board and the Veterans Court to address only those procedural arguments specifically raised by the veteran . . .\").   For instance, the Veteran has not alleged any deficiency with his January 2017 Travel Board hearing testimony as to the duties discussed in Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488, 496-97 (2010).  In this regard, the Federal Circuit recently ruled in Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2016) that a Bryant hearing deficiency was subject to the doctrine of issue exhaustion as laid out in the Scott case, cited to above.  Thus, the Board need not discuss any potential Bryant problem because the Veteran has not raised that issue before the Board.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Board is satisfied that the RO has provided all assistance required by the VCAA.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5103A (West 2014).  Hence, there is no error or issue that precludes the Board from addressing the merits of the service connection issues on appeal for left face nerve damage and a bilateral eye disability.\r\n\r\nII.  Service Connection\r\n\r\nService connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a).  \r\n\r\nUnder 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a), service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service - the so-called \"nexus\" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  The Federal Circuit Court recently held that diseases that would be considered \"chronic\" in a medical sense, but which are not listed in 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a) as an enumerated \"chronic disease,\" may still qualify for service connection under the three-element test for disability compensation described in � 3.303(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2013). \r\n\r\nBut under 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b), where the evidence shows an enumerated \"chronic disease\" in service (or within the presumptive period under � 3.307), or \"continuity of symptoms\" of such a disease after service, the disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service.  Walker, 708 F.3d at 1335-37.  Initially, certain bilateral eye disorders and left face nerve damage the Veteran has been diagnosed with are not an enumerated \"chronic disease\" listed under 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a); therefore, the presumptive provisions based on \"chronic\" symptoms in service and \"continuous\" symptoms since service at 38�C.F.R. � 3.303(b) do not apply for these disorders.  Walker, 708 F.3d at 1338-39.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the Veteran's glaucoma of the eyes is an enumerated \"chronic disease\" listed under 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a) (other organic disease of the nervous system); therefore, 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) does apply to that disorder.  Id.  Service connection for an enumerated \"chronic disease\" listed under 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a) such as glaucoma can also be also be established on a presumptive basis by showing that it manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).  \r\n\r\nThat is, under 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b), with an enumerated \"chronic disease\" such as glaucoma shown in service (or within the presumptive period under � 3.307), subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service-connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  See also Groves v. Peake, 524 F.3d 1306, 1309 (2008).  This rule does not mean that any manifestation of joint pain, any abnormality of heart action or heart sounds, any urinary findings of casts, or any cough, in service will permit service connection of arthritis, disease of the heart, nephritis, or pulmonary disease, first shown as a clear cut clinical entity, at some later date.  For the showing of chronic disease such as glaucoma in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word \"chronic.\"  When the disease identity is established (leprosy, tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, etc.), there is no requirement of evidentiary showing of continuity of symptomatology.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).  \r\n\r\nIn addition, for chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a) - such as glaucoma - service connection may be established by showing continuity of symptoms, which requires a claimant to demonstrate (1) that a condition was \"noted\" during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of symptoms; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a link between the present disability and the post-service symptoms.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b) (2016); see Walker, 708 F.3d at 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding that only those chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. � 3.309 are subject to service connection by continuity of symptoms described in � 3.303(b).  The correct understanding of the \"condition noted during service\" is that the condition is one that is indicative of but not dispositive of a chronic disease.  Walker, 708 F.3d at 1339.  Stated another way, continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required only where the condition noted during service (or in the presumptive period) is not, in fact, shown to be chronic or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned, i.e., \"when the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported.\"  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(b).  See also Walker, 708 F.3d at 1339-40.  \r\n\r\nUnder 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(d), disorders diagnosed after discharge may also still be service connected if all the evidence, including pertinent service records, establishes the disorder was incurred in service.  See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).\r\n\r\nA disability can also be service connected on a secondary basis if it is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected condition.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a).  Moreover, secondary service connection may be established, as well, by any increase in severity (i.e., aggravation) of a nonservice-connected condition that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected condition.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(b), effective October 10, 2006.  See 71 Fed. Reg. 52,744-52,747 (September 7, 2006).  See also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995); Tobin v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 34, 39 (1991).  Where a service-connected disability aggravates a nonservice-connected condition, a veteran may be compensated for the degree of disability (but only that degree) over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation.  Allen, 7 Vet. App. at 448.  \r\n\r\nIn short, in order to establish entitlement to service connection on this secondary basis, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) probative evidence establishing a nexus (i.e., link) between the service-connected disability and the current disability.  Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).\r\n\r\nVA is to give \"due consideration\" to \"all pertinent medical and lay evidence\" in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1154(a) (West 2014).  The Federal Circuit has held that medical evidence is not always or categorically required in every instance to establish a medical diagnosis or the required nexus between the claimed disability and the Veteran's military service.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009). \r\n\r\nThat is, lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Davidson, 581 F.3d at 1316.  See also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  In short, when considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case by case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent on the issues of diagnosis and medical causation.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 438 (2011).  \"The question of whether a particular medical issue is beyond the competence of a layperson-including both claimants and [VA adjudicators] must be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Id.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a layperson is competent to identify such disorders as varicose veins, tinnitus, and flat feet.  38 C.F.R. � 3.159(a)(2); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 310 (2007); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 405 (1995).  In contrast, a layperson is not competent to identify medical conditions that require scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge, such as in identifying bronchial asthma.  38 C.F.R. � 3.159(a)(1); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  \r\n\r\nTherefore, the Board must assess the competence and credibility of lay statements.  Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 308.  \r\n\r\nThe Federal Circuit has held that the Board can favor competent medical evidence over lay statements offered by the Veteran, as long as the Board neither deems lay evidence categorically incompetent nor improperly requires a medical opinion as the sole way to prove causation.  King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1344 (2012).\r\n\r\nIn determining whether service connection is warranted, the Board shall consider the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  38 U.S.C.A. 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102; Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1991).\r\n\r\n\tA.  Preliminary Discussion of Already Service-Connected TBI Injury\r\n\r\nInitially, in a very recent February 2017 rating decision, the Board sees the Veteran was service-connected for an underlying TBI that occurred in June 1963 during active duty while stationed with the Army in Korea.  The precise circumstances of how the TBI occurred are somewhat unclear.  The Veteran has reported that in May or June of 1963 near Camp Casey in Korea, he was attacked by two Korean civilians.  During the attack, the Veteran was struck on the left side of his head and face with an unknown object, but described at times as a brick.  He was knocked unconscious for an unknown period of time, but he does remember waking up in an Army medical facility.  He has inconsistently reported that the attack occurred while he was on guard duty, or in the alternative, while he was at a nightclub.  He was transported to MEDEVAC hospital in Camp Casey, and then placed in another Army Hospital in Korea.  STRs only document a fracture of his left zygoma, something (illegible) with his left eye, and a fracture of his left maxilla.  At that time, STRs relate that the Veteran had sustained this injury while playing baseball. However the Veteran has explained that he falsely reported the baseball injury to his commanding officer because he thought he would look bad, after he had been in a civilian village, which was an off-limit place.  So he admits he told an incorrect story to his commanding officer about how his TBI was sustained.  See November 2010 stressor statement for PTSD (VA Form 21-0781); August 2012 stressor statement for PTSD based on assault (VA Form 21-0781a); September 2011 VA psychiatry note; June 2012 VA psychological examination; January 2014 VA History and Physical; January 2017 Travel Board hearing testimony; February 2017 VA TBI examination. \r\n\r\nIn any event, the RO has already service-connected the Veteran for the underlying TBI with various residuals to include a fracture of the left zygoma, a left cheek scar, and tension headaches with loss of balance, dizziness, and fatigue, among other TBI residuals.  In addition, a February 2017 photo of the Veteran's face clearly shows significant indentation and injury to the left side of face, which is grossly distorted with elevation and depression.  The undersigned Veterans Law Judge also remarked upon this fact during the Veteran's January 2017 hearing testimony.  Thus, the Veteran has already been service-connected by VA for the in-service TBI with various residuals.  This fact is not in dispute.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, due to the verified and service-connected underlying TBI, the Board has specifically considered the presumptive provisions 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(d).  Under 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(d), in a veteran who has a service-connected TBI, the following shall be held to be the proximate result of the service-connected TBI, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary: (i) Parkinsonism, including Parkinson's disease, following moderate or severe TBI; (ii) Unprovoked seizures following moderate or severe TBI; (iii) Dementias of the following types: presenile dementia of the Alzheimer type, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, if manifest within 15 years following moderate or severe TBI; (iv) Depression if manifest within 3 years of moderate or severe TBI, or within 12 months of mild TBI; or (v) Diseases of hormone deficiency that result from hypothalamo-pituitary changes if manifest within 12 months of moderate or severe TBI.  Thus 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(d)(1) entails presumptive service connection for the above disabilities.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, there is no evidence of record showing that the Veteran's current depression was manifested within 3 years of moderate or severe TBI, or within 12 months of mild TBI.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(d)(1)(iv).  In addition, the Veteran's currently diagnosed eye disorders, PTSD, substance abuse disorder, and left face apraxia, are not listed under 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(d)(1) as one of the presumptive conditions associated with a TBI injury.  \r\n\r\nHowever, secondary service connection may also be awarded under 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(d)(2) for any condition not meeting the above criteria, under the generally applicable provisions of service connection.  This would entail consideration of non-presumptive service connection, established by the evidence of record.  Therefore, the Board will consider all of these disorders on a non-presumptive basis as well.  \r\n\r\nThe determination of the severity level (mild, moderate, or severe) of the underlying TBI is based on the TBI symptoms at the time of the injury or shortly thereafter. The TBI does not have to meet all the criteria listed under a certain severity level in order to classify the TBI at that severity level.  If a TBI meets the criteria in more than one category of severity, then the TBI should be ranked at the highest level in which a criterion is met, except where the qualifying criterion is the same at both levels.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(d)(3). \r\n\r\nA TBI is mild in severity if there is normal structural imaging, loss of consciousness for up to 30 minutes, alteration of consciousness or mental statement for a moment to up to 24 hours, post-traumatic amnesia for up to a day, and a Glasgow Coma Scale ranging from 13 to 15.  A TBI is moderate in severity if there is normal or abnormal structural imaging, loss of consciousness from 30 minutes to less than 24 hours, alteration of consciousness or mental state for more than 24 hours, post-traumatic amnesia from one to 7 days, or Glasgow Coma Scale from 9-12.  A TBI is severe if there is normal or abnormal structural imaging, loss of consciousness for more than 24 hours, alteration of consciousness or mental state for more than 24 hours, post-traumatic amnesia for more than 7 days or a Glasgow Coma Scale of 3-8.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(d)(3).\r\n\r\nThe resultant disabling effects of a TBI event beyond those that follow immediately from the acute injury to the brain are known as TBI residuals or TBI sequelae.  The signs and symptoms of TBI residuals can be organized into the three main categories of physical, cognitive, and behavioral / emotional residuals for evaluation purposes.  TBI residuals can resolve in a short period of time, persist chronically or permanently, or may also have a delayed onset.  See M21-1, Live Manual, Part III, Subpart iv, Chapter 4, Section G, Topic 2, Block d (change date September 29, 2016).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the in-service TBI, after review of the medical and lay evidence of record (see e.g., October 2011 VA TBI examination), it appears the Veteran's in-service June 1963 TBI injury was \"moderate\" to \"severe\" due to loss of consciousness for around 24 hours or alteration of consciousness or mental state for more than 24 hours.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(d)(3).  \r\n\r\nThe Board will now turn to consideration of service connection and secondary service connection for the specfic disabilities on appeal.  \r\n\r\n\tB.  Left Face Nerve Damage\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he has nerve damage or neurological damage to the left side of his face as a residual of his already service-connected TBI.  He says he developed nerve damage related to his in-service facial trauma in 1963.  Post-service, he says he did not have health insurance, so he simply lived with the pain until 2010.  The Veteran currently reports numbness in the left cheek.  See August 2010 formal claim for TBI; January 2014 DRO conference; January 2017 hearing testimony at pages 7-8; February 2017 VA skin / scar examination report.    \r\n\r\nUpon review of the evidence of record, the Board concludes that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection or secondary service connection for left face nerve damage. \r\n\r\nImportantly, the Veteran is already service-connected for a broad array of residuals of his in-service TBI.  Specifically, he has been assigned a 70 percent rating for residuals of a TBI under 38 C.F.R. � 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8045.  Also, he has been assigned a 30 percent rating for residuals of fracture of the left zygoma, with residual left cheek scar, under 38 C.F.R. � 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800 (scars of the head, face, or neck).  In addition, he has been assigned a 10 percent rating for a painful left cheek scar under 38 C.F.R. � 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804.  Finally, he has been assigned a 0 percent rating for tension headaches with loss of balance, dizziness, and fatigue, under 38 C.F.R. � 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.  \r\n      \r\nAccording to the February 2017 rating decision, the 70 percent rating for the Veteran's TBI already considered neurological residuals of his TBI.  This was based on the findings of a February 2017 VA TBI examiner.  Specifically, a level of severity of \"2\" has been assigned for the Veteran's motor activity (with intact motor and sensory system) facet based on motor activity mildly decreased or with moderate slowing due to \"apraxia.\"  Apraxia is defined as the loss of ability to carry out familiar, purposeful movements in the absence of paralysis or other motor sensory impairment.  See DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 120 (30TH Ed. 2003).  \r\n      \r\nThe evaluation of the same disability or the same manifestations of disability under multiple diagnoses is to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. � 4.14.  A claimant may not be compensated twice for the same symptomatology as \"such a result would overcompensate the claimant for the actual impairment of his earning capacity.\"  Brady v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 203, 206 (1993).  This would result in pyramiding, contrary to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 4.14.  See also Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (\"two defined diagnoses constitute the same disability for purposes of section 4.14 if they have overlapping symptomatology\"). \r\n\r\nHowever, when a veteran has separate and distinct manifestations attributable to the same injury, he should be compensated under different diagnostic codes with different ratings.  Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994).  See also Fanning v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 225 (1993).  The critical inquiry in making such a determination is whether any of the disabling symptomatology is duplicative or overlapping.  The Veteran is entitled to a combined rating only where the symptomatology is distinct and separate.  Id.  \r\n\r\nThe existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131; Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability.  In the absence of proof of a present, separate disability from nerve damage to the left side of his face, there can be no valid claim for direct service connection.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1110; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary).  \r\n\r\nIn order for a Veteran to qualify for basic entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C.A. � 1110 or � 1131, the Veteran must prove existence of a disability, and one that has resulted from a disease or injury that occurred in the line of duty.  See Sanchez-Benitez v. Principi, 259 F.3d 1356, 1361 (2001).  The mere fact of a veteran reporting subjective symptoms, whether pain or otherwise, does not necessarily warrant a finding that he has met the current disability due to disease or injury requirement.  Rather, an underlying disease or injury is required, with current impairment of some sort. \r\n\r\nOn this issue, there is no probative evidence of any current, distinct neurological symptomatology from the Veteran's service-connected TBI that would permit a separate rating for any facial nerve disorder, other than what he already has.  Accordingly, as evaluation of the same disability or the same manifestations of disability under multiple diagnoses (i.e., pyramiding) is to be avoided, service connection or secondary service connection for separate nerve damage to the face is not warranted.  Simply stated, the Veteran is already service connected by the RO for whatever neurological symptoms to the face he has, as a residual of his TBI.  See 38 C.F.R. � 4.14.    \r\n\r\nOn this issue, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran reported numbness of the face to the February 2017 VA TBI examiner.  But this is the only time the Veteran reported this specific symptom in the record, including in VA and private treatment records.  Moreover, in contrast, the medical evidence of record outweighs the Veteran's subjective complaint.  No medical professional of record has assessed additional neurological impairment to the face as a residual of the Veteran's TBI, aside from the motor activity mildly decreased or with moderate slowing due to \"apraxia.\"  For example, at an August 2010 VA History and Physical, the Veteran's neurological examination was normal.  An October 2011 VA eye examination assessed no optic nerve pallor in both eyes from the in-service trauma.  A January 2013 VA eye note showed no retinal nerve fiber thinning.  The ocular nerve examination was normal.  Finally, the February 2017 VA TBI examiner found no evidence of cranial nerve dysfunction.  In addition, the same VA TBI examiner did not identify any specific sensory dysfunction impairment due to the TBI and did not check the sensory dysfunction impairment box for any residuals.  The VA TBI examiner also did not find it necessary to order a separate cranial or peripheral nerve questionnaire.  In summary, no clinical evidence of record reveals any distinct neurological symptomatology to the face other than the Veteran's already service-connected apraxia.  FILE\r\n\r\nOnce again, the existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997).  Absent probative or reliable evidence of any current, distinct neurological symptomatology to the face other than the Veteran's already service-connected apraxia, service connection cannot be granted in the present case.  Boyer, 210 F.3d at 1353; Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's service connection claim for left face nerve damage.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107; 38 C.F.R. � 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  \r\n\r\n      C.  Bilateral Eye Disability\r\n\r\nThe Veteran contends that he has \"blurred vision\" in both eyes that began in service, or developed over time secondary to his service-connected TBI.  The Veteran says he did not receive any medical treatment for the blurred vision until VA treatment in 2010.  Glasses did not help him clear up the blurriness either.  See August 2010 formal claim for TBI; December 2010 Veteran's statement; September 2010 VA eye consult.  \r\n\r\nAt the outset, the Board emphasizes that in the present decision it is service-connecting the Veteran for left eye blindness with loss of visual acuity as secondary to the service-connected TBI with a fracture of the left zygoma.  The analysis of this secondary service connection grant will be discussed in further detail below.  However, what is at issue in this section of the decision is whether service connection or secondary service connection is warranted for a separate bilateral eye blurred vision or other bilateral eye disability, as distinct from left eye blindness.   \r\n\r\nIn this vein, VA must fully and sympathetically develop a veteran's claim to its optimum, and that requires VA to determine all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations.  Moody v. Principi, 360 F.3d 1306, 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Szemraj v. Principi, 357 F.3d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The Court has held that a claimant's identification of the benefit sought does not require technical precision.  See Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 256-57 (2007).  The Court has further held that a claimant may satisfy this requirement by referring to a body part or system that is disabled or by describing symptoms of the disability.  Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 86-87 (2009); see also Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009) (stating that, when determining the scope of a claim, the Board must consider the claimant's description of the claim; the symptoms the claimant describes; and the information the claimant submits or that the Secretary obtains in support of that claim).  Thus, the Board in the present decision has considered whether service connection is warranted for all of the Veteran's eye diagnoses identified in the record.  \r\n  \r\nUpon review of the evidence of record, the Board concludes that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection or secondary service connection for a bilateral eye disability to include \"blurred vision\" in both eyes.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary).  In the present case, there is sufficient evidence that the Veteran meets the threshold criterion for service connection of a current bilateral eye disability.  Boyer, 210 F.3d at 1353; Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.  Here, VA eye clinic notes and examinations dated from 2010 to 2016 reveal various diagnoses of ocular hypertension, glaucoma, cataracts, and refractive error / presbyopia.  The Veteran also has been prescribed various prescriptions to treat these eye disorders.  Thus, the evidence clearly reveals current bilateral eye disabilities for the Veteran as assessed by VA eye physicians.  Thus, the first element of service connection is met.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the remaining two elements of service connection are not met for these particular eye disorders.  STRs dated from 1961 to 1964 are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of ocular hypertension, glaucoma, cataracts, or other vision abnormalities.  His uncorrected visual acuity was recorded as 20/20 in both eyes at separation in May 1964.  No eye disability was objectively observed at separation.  He also denied any eye problems at separation.  There is no evidence of an enumerated \"chronic\" disease such as glaucoma shown during service or within one year of service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.309(a); Walker, 708 F.3d at 1339.  \r\n\r\nPost-service, the Veteran did not receive any treatment for his eyes until 2010 according to the Veteran, aside from getting glasses.  Post-service, with regard to a nexus, there is probative medical evidence of record that clearly weighs against a relationship between the Veteran's present bilateral eye disabilities listed above and his period of military service.  Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366.  See also 38 C.F.R. � 3.303(a), (d).  Specifically, after an examination and review of the claims folder, an October 2011 VA eye examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral cataracts are not caused by his left side head and face trauma. The rationale was that \"traumatic\" cataracts would have a stellate appearance, but in contrast the Veteran has nuclear and cortical cataracts which are usually caused by aging.  In formulating this opinion, the VA eye examiner cited his review of medical literature, medical records, and his clinical experience.  The VA eye examiner also opined that the Veteran's glaucoma suspect was less likely as not (less than 50/50 probability) caused by the in-service left side head and face trauma.  In formulating this opinion, the VA eye examiner cited his review of medical literature, medical records, and his clinical experience.  This VA eye examiner did not diagnose the Veteran with ocular hypertension.  Overall, this VA eye examination and opinion was thorough, supported by an explanation, based on a review of the claims folder, and supported by the probative evidence of record.  Importantly, the Veteran has not submitted any contrary medical nexus opinion of record with regard to his bilateral eye blurred vision.  Furthermore, an October 2013 VA eye note indicated that Veteran's failure to take his medications and keep his appointments was causing his blurred vision, and that his blurred vision does not appear to be due to any injury or nerve damage.  \r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges that blurred vision is listed in a VA Live Manual table as one of the potential physical residuals or sequelae of a TBI.  TBI residuals can resolve in a short period of time, persist chronically or permanently, or may also have a delayed onset.  See M21-1, Live Manual, Part III, Subpart iv, Chapter 4, Section G, Topic 2, Block d (change date September 29, 2016).  However, the VA Live Manual also states that VA should not automatically concede that a new sign, symptom or diagnosis is a residual of a TBI simply because it is listed in the table or evaluation criteria.  See Id. at Block j.  \r\n\r\nIn any event, service connection for residuals of a TBI can be either on a direct or secondary basis.  In this regard, secondary service connection may be awarded under 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(d)(2) for any condition under the generally applicable provisions of service connection.  See also M21-1, Live Manual, Part III, Subpart iv, Chapter 4, Section G, Topic 3, Blocks a to i (change date May 9, 2016).  The October 2011 VA eye examination provides strong evidence against any secondary relationship for blurred vision to the Veteran's service-connected TBI.   \r\n\r\nWith regard to the Veteran's lay assertions, the Veteran is indeed competent to report purported symptoms of bilateral eye blurriness during and after service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(a)(2); Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 307-09.  But the Veteran's lay assertions in the present case are outweighed by the clinical findings of the October 2011 VA eye examiner, who determined that the Veteran's current bilateral eye disabilities did not originate during service or as the result of the Veteran's TBI.  The Federal Circuit has held that the Board can favor competent medical evidence over lay statements offered by the Veteran, as long as the Board neither deems lay evidence categorically incompetent nor improperly requires a medical opinion as the sole way to prove causation.  King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1344 (2012).  In this case, the VA eye examiner reviewed and considered the evidence of record, including the Veteran's statements, and provided a medical opinion with a supporting rationale relying on medical training, knowledge, and expertise.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's service connection claim and secondary service connection claim of bilateral eye blurriness from ocular hypertension, glaucoma, or cataracts. 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107; 38 C.F.R. � 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  \r\n\r\nThe Board now turns to the Veteran's diagnosis of refractive error (RE) in the record.  In this regard, the Veteran has been diagnosed with refractive error and presbyopia in both eyes in post-service VA treatment records.  See June 2013 October 2013, October 2014, and April 2015 VA eye notes and VA eye examinations.   \r\n\r\nDefects are defined as \"structural or inherent abnormalities or conditions which are more or less stationary in nature.\"  VAOPGCPREC 82-90 (July 18, 1990); VAOPGCPREC 67-90 (July 18, 1990).  Congenital or developmental \"defects,\" such as refractive error, automatically rebut the presumption of soundness and are therefore considered to have preexisted service.  38 U.S.C.A. �� 1111; 38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(c), 4.9.  In this regard, the courts have held that the presumption of soundness does not apply to congenital defects, such as refractive error.  Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1383-84 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Winn v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 510, 516 (1996) (holding that a non-disease or non-injury entity such as a congenital defect is \"not the type of disease- or injury-related defect to which the presumption of soundness can apply\").  \r\n\r\nIn addition, service connection is generally precluded by VA regulation for congenital or developmental \"defects\" such as refractive error because they are not \"diseases\" or \"injuries\" within the meaning of applicable legislation.  38 C.F.R. �� 3.303(c), 4.9, 4.127; Palczewski v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 174, 179 (2007).  However, a congenital defect such as refractive error can still be subject to superimposed disease or injury during active service.  VAOPGCPREC 82-90.  If such superimposed disease or injury does occur, service connection may be warranted for the resulting disability.  Id.  \r\n\r\nIn contrast, VA's Office of General Counsel has distinguished between congenital or developmental defects, such as refractive error, for which service connection is precluded by regulation, and congenital or hereditary diseases, for which service connection may be granted, if initially manifested in or aggravated by service.  See VAOPGCPREC 82-90, VAOPGCPREC 67-90.  The General Counsel draws on medical authorities and case law from other federal jurisdictions and concludes that a defect differs from a disease in that a defect is \"more or less stationary in nature\", while a disease is \"capable of improving or deteriorating.\"  See VAOPGCPREC 82-90 at para. 2.\r\n\r\nThe VA Live Manual further instructs that defects of form or structure of the eye that are of congenital or developmental origin may not be considered as disabilities or service-connected on the basis of incurrence or aggravation beyond natural progress during service.  Rather, actual pathology, other than refractive error, is required to support impairment of visual acuity.  The fact that a Veteran was supplied with glasses for correcting refractive error is not, in itself, considered indicative of aggravation by service that would warrant compensation.  See M21-1, Part III, Subpart iv, Chapter 4, Section B, Topic 1, Blocks b, c, and e (May 7, 2015).  The Veteran's presbyopia, as diagnosed by the VA eye examiners in the present case, is considered to be a form of refractive error.  See Id. at Block d.  In adults, refractive errors are generally stationary or change slowly until the stage of presbyopia.  See Id. at Block e.  Thus, as mentioned, service connection for refractive error in most circumstances is precluded by VA regulation and by the opinions of VA's Office of General Counsel and by VA's Live Manual.  \r\n\r\nHowever, a congenital defect, such as refractive error, can still be subject to superimposed disease or injury during active service.  VAOPGCPREC 82-90.  If such superimposed disease or injury does occur, service connection may be warranted for the resulting disability.  Id.  In the present case, although the Veteran sustained a TBI during service, no probative evidence of record establishes that his refractive error resulted in additional disability from the TBI.  Absent any probative evidence that his current refractive error is due to in-service trauma or was subject to a superimposed disease or injury during service resulting in additional disability, the refractive error is not a disability for purposes of VA disability compensation as it is congenital in nature.  38 C.F.R. � 3.303(c).  See, e.g., Browder v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 204 (1991) (pertaining to refractive error).  Thus, service connection for refractive error and presbyopia is denied.                \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the preponderance of the evidence is against service connection for bilateral eye refractive error / presbyopia.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).\r\n\r\n      D.  Left Eye Blindness with Loss of Visual Acuity\r\n\r\nHowever, with regard to secondary service connection, there is some probative medical and lay evidence of record that demonstrates that the Veteran's current left eye blindness with loss of visual acuity is proximately due to or the result of his service-connected TBI with a fracture of the left zygoma.  38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a), (d)(2); Velez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 148, 158 (1998).  Initially, it is noted the Veteran's in-service June 1963 TBI injury was \"moderate\" to \"severe\" due to loss of consciousness for around 24 hours or alteration of consciousness or mental state for more than 24 hours.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(d)(3).  As to evidence of a secondary nexus to service-connected TBI with a fracture of the left zygoma, a June 7, 1963 STR documenting a fracture of the left zygoma also mentions something about the left eye, but the writing explaining the notation is illegible.  However, November 2010, January 2011, May 2011, and August 2011 VA eye notes opined there was visual loss of the left eye of +2' due to trauma from the 1963 service-connected TBI.  Current visual acuity in the left eye was 20/400, while in the right eye it was much better at 20/30+.  These VA eye notes and examinations provide strong evidence in support of the left eye claim.  In addition, VA eye notes dated in October 2013 and August 2014 reflected that visual acuity in the left eye was reduced, but the etiology was unclear.  A VA eye note dated in April 2015 observed that the Veteran's left eye acuity was reduced, but again the etiology was unclear.  VA optometrists added that although the Veteran's left eye cataract was consistent  with reduced vision, the loss of visual acuity still appears to VA medical professionals to be worse than expected with a cataract alone.    \r\n\r\nAccordingly, secondary service connection for left eye blindness with loss of visual acuity is warranted.  38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102.  The Board emphasizes that it is granting secondary service connection left eye blindness with loss of visual acuity on the basis that it is the direct result of a service-connected TBI disability, as opposed to aggravation.   \r\n\r\n\tE.  PTSD with Depression and Polysubstance Abuse\r\n\r\nService connection for PTSD has unique evidentiary requirements.  It generally requires:  (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-5); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  See also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  \r\n\r\nEffective August 4, 2014, VA amended the portion of its Schedule for Rating Disabilities dealing with mental disorders and its adjudication regulations that define the term \"psychosis\" to remove outdated references to the DSM-IV and replace them with references to the recently updated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fifth Edition) (the DSM-5).  See 79 Fed. Reg. 45,094 (August 4, 2014).  VA adopted as final, without change, this interim final rule and clarified that the provisions of this interim final rule do not apply to claims that have been certified for appeal to the Board or are pending before the Board on or before August 4, 2014.  See Schedule for Rating Disabilities - Mental Disorders and Definition of Psychosis for Certain VA Purposes, 80 Fed. Reg. 14,308 (March 19, 2015). \r\n\r\nIn the present case, the RO certified the Veteran's PTSD appeal to the Board in March 2015, which is after August 4, 2014.  Thus, the amended 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) conforming to the DSM-5 is applicable in the present case.  In any event, the Board will still consider any private or VA examiner's discussion of both the DSM-IV and DSM-5 in adjudicating the current Veteran's PTSD claim, in order to provide the Veteran with every benefit of the doubt.  \r\n\r\nIf VA determines either that the veteran did not engage in combat with the enemy or that the veteran did engage in combat, but that the alleged stressor is not combat related, the veteran's lay testimony, by itself, is not sufficient to establish the occurrence of the alleged stressor.  Instead, the record must contain credible supporting evidence that corroborates the veteran's testimony or statements.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f); Stone v. Nicholson, 480 F.3d 1111 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 147 (1997); Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395 (1996).  \r\n\r\nWith regard to an actual diagnosis of PTSD, lay persons are not categorically incompetent to speak on matters of medical diagnosis or etiology.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  The Board must consider the type of condition specifically claimed and whether it is readily amenable to lay diagnosis or probative comment on etiology.  See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007).  In this regard, the Federal Circuit recently held that \"PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence . . . is competent and sufficient to identify.\"  Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 2014).  Regardless, the Board acknowledges the Veteran is competent to report psychiatric symptoms both during and after service.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.159(a)(2); Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 (discussing that Veteran is competent to report a contemporaneous medical diagnosis); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (discussing general competency of a Veteran to report psychiatric symptoms).  \r\n\r\nThat is, lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Davidson, 581 F.3d at 1316.  See also Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77.  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the Veteran does not allege that he was in combat.  Instead, the Veteran contends that he has PTSD attributable to his in-service physical assault by two Korean civilians in June 1963 outside of Camp Casey, Korea.  During the attack, the Veteran was struck on the left side of his head and face with an unknown object, but described at times as a brick.  He was knocked unconscious for an unknown period of time, but he does remember waking up in an Army medical facility.  He has inconsistently reported that the attack occurred while he was on guard duty, or in the alternative, while he was at a nightclub.  He was transported to MEDEVAC hospital in Camp Casey, and then placed in another Army Hospital in Korea.  STRs only document a fracture of his left zygoma, something (illegible) with his left eye, and a fracture of his left maxilla.  He says he engaged in alcohol and drug abuse while in service, subsequent to the assault.  He also contends that behavioral issues began to arise, such that he was eventually reduced in rank and had a change of assignment.  Post-service, he became depressed and treated himself by way of drugs and alcohol.  As a result of this traumatic in-service assault, the Veteran has claimed that he developed PTSD with depression and polysubstance abuse, and at times has been homeless.  See November 2010 stressor statement for PTSD (VA Form 21-0781); August 2012 stressor statement for PTSD based on assault (VA Form 21-0781a); September 2011 VA psychiatry note; June 2012 VA psychological examination; January 2014 VA History and Physical; January 2017 Travel Board hearing testimony; February 2017 VA TBI examination. \r\n\r\nThe Veteran's PTSD claim is predicated on an allegation of a physical assault while he was in the military.  Because personal trauma is an extremely personal and sensitive issue, many incidents are not officially reported, which creates a proof problem with respect to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.  In such situations, it is not unusual for there to be an absence of service records documenting the events the veteran has alleged.  The victims of such trauma may not necessarily report the full circumstances of the trauma for many years after the trauma.  See VA Live Manual M21-1, III.iv.4.H.4.b. (Change date March 31, 2017).  \r\n\r\nTherefore, VA cannot use the absence of service record documentation or lack of report of in-service sexual assault or physical assault to military authorities as evidence to conclude that an assault did not occur.  AZ v. Shinseki, 731 F.3d 1303, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2013).\r\n\r\nThus, when a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records may corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor incident.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5).  See also Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272, 277 (1999).  It is often necessary to seek alternative evidence that may demonstrate the presence of markers.  The term marker refers to evidentiary signs, events, or circumstances indicating a possibility that the claimed stressor occurred, such as reports, lay statements, or behavioral changes that may be associated with the approximate timeframe of the claimed stressor.  See VA Live Manual M21-1, IV.ii.1.D.5.m. (Change date March 31, 2017).  \r\n\r\nExamples of such evidence include, but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities; rape crisis centers; mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5).   \r\n\r\nEvidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is another type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources.  That is, if STRs and SPRs contain no explicit documentation that personal trauma occurred, and alternative sources of evidence do not provide credible supporting evidence of personal trauma, VA should consider secondary evidence including evidence of behavioral changes around the time of, and after, the incident(s).  See VA Live Manual M21-1, III.iv.4.H.4.d. (Change date March 16, 2017).  \r\n\r\nExamples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include, but are not limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5).    \r\n\r\nFurthermore, corroboration of every detail of a claimed stressor, including the veteran's personal participation, is not required; rather, a veteran only needs to offer independent evidence of a stressful event that is sufficient to imply his or her personal exposure.  See Pentecost v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 124, 128 (2002) (quoting Suozzi v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 307 (1997)).  \r\n \r\nThe Court has set a relatively low bar for interpreting a claim for PTSD as one involving a personal assault stressor for which the provisions of 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5) are applicable.  See, e.g., Bradford v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 200 (2006) (veteran alleged that his sergeant kicked him down a set of stairs).  VA itself has defined personal trauma very broadly.  Personal trauma for the purpose of VA disability compensation claims based on PTSD refers broadly to stressor events involving harm perpetrated by a person who is not considered part of an enemy force.  Examples include assault, battery, robbery, mugging, stalking, and harassment.  Military sexual trauma is a subset of personal trauma and refers to sexual harassment, sexual assault, or rape that occurs in a military setting.  See VA Live Manual M21-1, IV.ii.1.D.5.a. (Change date March 31, 2017).  \r\n\r\nFor a PTSD claim based on personal assault, an after-the-fact medical opinion can serve as the credible supporting evidence of the stressor.  That is, VA examiners can interpret the evidence of record to confirm the occurrence of in-service physical assault, sexual assault, or harassment.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5); Menegassi v. Shinseki, 638 F.3d 1379, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2011); Bradford v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 200, 207 (2006); Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272, 280 (1999).  In fact, secondary evidence or behavior change evidence typically needs interpretation by a clinician in personal trauma claims.  The VA examiner should determine whether credible factual evidence of behavior changes demonstrated by the Veteran is consistent with the expected reaction or adjustment of a person who has been subjected to an assault.  See VA Live Manual M21-1, III.iv.4.H.4.f. (Change date March 16, 2017); IV.ii.1.D.5.r. (Change date March 31, 2017).  \r\n\r\nUpon review of the evidence of record, the Board concludes that the Veteran is entitled to service connection for PTSD with depression and polysubstance abuse.\r\n\r\nSTRs dated from 1961 to 1964 are negative for any complaint, treatment, or diagnosis of PTSD or other acquired psychiatric disorder.  In addition, no psychiatric disorder was objectively found at the Veteran's May 1964 separation examination, and the Veteran denied a history of insomnia, depression, excessive worry, or nervous trouble.  In any event, as to PTSD, an in-service diagnosis is not required.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  \r\n\r\nSPRs document that the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) was a physical activities specialist.  He served in Korea from August 1962 to September 1963.  A June 18, 1963 SPR personnel action - reclassification board, several weeks after his June 7, 1963 TBI occurred, noted that the Veteran had been counseled for the past three months on his completely disinterested attitude towards his military duties.  The counseling had a completely negative result.  He was noted to be three months behind in filing and posting of orders and correspondence to the personnel records.  He was recommended for reduction in rank for inefficiency.  He had the lowest academic standing of all 65 students.  He was separated from service in April 1964.  \r\n\r\nUpon review, there is evidence of record corroborating that the early June 1963 in-service physical assault and TBI occurred.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5); Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 147; Moreau, 9 Vet. App. at 395.  Specifically, the RO has already service-connected the Veteran for the underling TBI with various residuals to include a fracture of the left zygoma, a left cheek scar, and tension headaches with loss of balance, dizziness, and fatigue, among other TBI residuals.  In addition, a February 2017 photo of the Veteran's face clearly shows significant indentation and injury to the left side of face, which is grossly distorted with elevation and depression.  The undersigned Veterans Law Judge also remarked upon this fact during the Veteran's January 2017 hearing testimony.  Thus, the Veteran has already been service-connected by VA for the in-service TBI with various residuals.  The evidence of deterioration in work performance is not fully clear because it appears his work performance problems preceded his in-service TBI by several months.  In any event, for corroboration in assault cases, what is required is that sufficient circumstantial evidence exists that the alleged assault may have a basis in fact.  The Board emphasizes that a stressor need not be corroborated in every detail. Pentecost, 16 Vet. App. at 128.  In the present case corroborative evidence of the alleged in-service physical assault in June 1963 is circumstantial in nature, not definitive in nature.  However, again, the in-service TBI was service-connected by the RO in a recent February 2017 rating decision.  In addition, as discussed below, multiple VA psychiatrists have concluded that the Veteran's in-service assault did occur.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to the criteria of a current diagnosis of PTSD, the threshold consideration for any service connection claim is the existence of a current disability.  38 U.S.C.A. � 1131; 38 C.F.R. � 3.303; Boyer, 210 F.3d at 1353; Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.  In particular, aside from corroboration of an in-service stressor, current medical evidence diagnosing PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-5) is required, as well as competent evidence of a nexus between current PTSD symptomatology and his verified in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f).  See also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  \r\n\r\nHowever, again, medical opinions in cases of personal assault for PTSD are exceptions to the general rule - as, for example, announced in Moreau v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 389, 396 (1996), that an opinion by a medical professional based on a post-service examination cannot be used to establish the occurrence of a stressor. 38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(3); Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272, 280 (1999).  For assault stressors, the examiner can interpret the meaning of behavioral changes during service to determine if an assault stressor did occur.  Id.  \r\n\r\nIn the present case, VA psychiatric treatment records dated from 2010 to 2016 have rendered a current diagnosis of PTSD.  This is not in dispute.  \r\n\r\nBut more importantly, with regard to a nexus, VA medical opinions of record assessed that a personal assault accompanied by a TBI did occur in June 1963, in addition to concluding that a diagnosis of PTSD due to the credible June 1963 personal assault was proper.  38 C.F.R. � 3.304(f)(5).  \r\n\r\nIn particular, the record reflects several favorable VA medical opinions and treatment records from VA psychiatrists dated from 2010 to 2016.  The Board has reviewed VA psychiatry notes and VA history and physicals dated in September 2011, January 2014, December 2015, and August 2016 from the same VA psychiatrist who was familiar with the Veteran due to repeated treatment.  This VA psychiatrist opined that the Veteran had PTSD more likely than not to be the direct result of the attack on him during service in Korea.  Several of the latter opinions considered the DSM-5.  This VA psychiatrist repeatedly discussed details of the TBI incident in Korea, and repeatedly discussed the Veteran's PTSD symptoms.  In a January 2014 opinion, the same VA psychiatrist, when advised by VA of inconsistent descriptions of the in-service TBI by the Veteran, nonetheless opined that she was \"convinced that the injury was done by a brick thrown at him, was done by a Korean and that everything is as I had opined in all my documentation on this patient.\"  The VA examiner also described the Veteran as \"highly credible.\"  In addition, a different May 2011 VA psychiatrist came to the same favorable conclusion as to PTSD.  Also, the Veteran underwent positive PTSD screens in August 2010, November 2010, December 2010, September 2011, July 2013, October 2014, and October 2015.  These PTSD screens revealed positive symptomatology such as nightmares, avoidance, numbness, detachment, and hypervigilance.  They were also often accompanied by positive depression screens.  Moreover, in July 2012, a VA nurse practitioner opinion stated that both VA primary care and VA psychiatry suggest that the Veteran's PTSD \"could\" be related to the head trauma he received while in the Army in Korea.  Finally, VA Vet Center counseling records dated from 2014 to 2016 assessed the Veteran with multiple symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of PTSD based on the in-service assault in Korea.  \r\n\r\nPursuant to 38 C.F.R. � 4.125(a), if the diagnosis of a mental disorder does not conform to DSM-IV / DSM-5 or is not supported by the findings on the examination report, the rating agency shall return the report to the examiner to substantiate the diagnosis.  Mental health professionals are experts and are presumed to know the DSM requirements applicable to their practice and to have taken them into account in providing a PTSD diagnosis.  As such, the Court has held that a PTSD diagnosis provided by a mental-health professional must be presumed to have been made in accordance with the applicable DSM-IV (or DSM-5) criteria as to both the adequacy of the symptomatology and the sufficiency of the stressor, unless there is evidence to the contrary.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140 (1997).  The DSM-IV (or DSM-5) cannot be used \"as a basis for rejecting the Veteran's favorable medical evidence as to the sufficiency of a stressor or the adequacy of the Veteran's symptomatology.\"  Id.  As such, in order to make a finding that the Veteran in this case did not have a valid PTSD diagnosis, the Board must clearly articulate its reasons for finding that the PTSD diagnosis was not made in accordance with the DSM-IV or DSM-5 requirements.  If the Board cannot support a conclusion that the diagnosis was not made in accordance with DSM-IV or DSM-5 requirements, it must accept the diagnosis as valid.  \r\n\r\nIn the present case, the Board will therefore accept the above PTSD diagnoses rendered by VA medical professionals as valid and in accordance with the DSM-IV and DSM-5.  In any event, the VA psychiatrists of record described the reasons for their conclusions and also discussed the Veteran's underlying PTSD symptomatology.  \r\n\r\nOverall, the above VA psychiatry notes and opinions were thorough, supported by explanations, and considered the Veteran's history and relevant longitudinal complaints.  In short, there is probative evidence in support of the PTSD claim.   The Board emphasizes that VA may not order additional development for the sole purpose of obtaining evidence unfavorable to a claimant.  Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003).  \r\n\r\nThe Board acknowledges that some unfavorable evidence of record with respect to the Veteran's PTSD exists.  Specifically, a VA psychological examiner in July 2012 and August 2012 (the same VA examiner), after a mental health examination of the Veteran and a review of the evidence of record, opined that the Veteran did not meet any of the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.  However, the underlying premise of this opinion is flawed.  The VA examiner determined that the in-service June 1963 TBI never took place.  But subsequently, the RO determined that it did in fact take place based on the findings of a later February 2017 VA TBI examiner.  At that point, the RO in a February 2017 rating decision service-connected the Veteran for the underlying incident in question, and awarded the Veteran service-connected compensation for various residuals of his in-service TBI from the assault.  The Court has held on a number of occasions that a medical opinion premised upon an inaccurate factual premise is of no probative value.  See Sklar v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 140 (1993); Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458 (1993); Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993); Swann v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 229, 232 (1993).  Thus, the unfavorable VA psychological examination reports dated in July 2012 and August 2012 are entitled to only limited probative value against the claim.  \r\n\r\nGiven the law and the medical evidence of record, the Board is compelled to grant the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and allow service connection for PTSD.  See 38 U.S.C.A. � 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. � 3.102. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Board has also considered whether the Veteran's PTSD claim raised the issue of whether service connection is warranted for any other acquired psychiatric disorder in addition to PTSD.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009) (holding that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record).  In this regard, the record also shows the Veteran has depression, NOS, and polysubstance abuse disorder as secondary to his service-connected PTSD and his service-connected TBI.  See 38 C.F.R. � 3.310(a).  Specifically, in August 2010 and May 2011 VA psychiatric notes, it was mentioned that the Veteran began to use alcohol and drugs to deal with his physical TBI pain after he left service.  The Board has also reviewed VA psychiatry notes and history and physicals dated in September 2011, January 2014, December 2015, and August 2016 from the same VA psychiatrist who was familiar with the Veteran due to repeated treatment. Psychiatric testing revealed \"moderate depression.\"  This VA psychiatrist opined that the Veteran had a TBI-based pain disorder \"with psychological factors\" and that his drug and alcohol addiction was the result of his in-service TBI.  In September 2011 the VA psychiatrist remarked that \"chemical dependency was his way of self-medicating for the pain and PTSD.\"\r\n\r\nIn any event, the present decision is considered a full grant of the benefits sought by the Veteran for his acquired psychiatric disorder claim to include PTSD.  In granting service connection for PTSD with depression and polysubstance abuse, the RO should assign a disability rating or ratings that encompass the symptoms of these disorders.  See Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377, 1381 (2009) (two defined diagnoses constitute the same disability for purposes of 38 C.F.R. � 4.14 if they have overlapping symptomatology, but bipolar disorder and PTSD could have different symptoms and it could therefore be improper in some circumstances for VA to treat these separately diagnosed conditions as producing only the same disability).  \r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nService connection for left face nerve damage, to include as secondary to a service-connected TBI with a fracture of the left zygoma, is denied.\r\n\r\nService connection for a bilateral eye disability (claimed as \"blurred vision\"), to include as secondary to a service-connected TBI with a fracture of the left zygoma, is denied.  \r\n\r\nSubject to the provisions governing the award of monetary benefits, service connection for left eye blindness with loss of visual acuity as secondary to a service-connected TBI with a fracture of the left zygoma, is granted. \r\n\r\nSubject to the provisions governing the award of monetary benefits, service connection for PTSD with depression and polysubstance abuse is granted. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________________________\r\nDAVID L.
